### `mtcars`

- For this lesson, we will use the (infamous) `mtcars` dataset that comes
  with R by default.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
data("mtcars")
glimpse(mtcars)
```

???

1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles.

[, 1]	mpg	Miles/(US) gallon
[, 2]	cyl	Number of cylinders
[, 3]	disp	Displacement (cu.in.)
[, 4]	hp	Gross horsepower
[, 5]	drat	Rear axle ratio
[, 6]	wt	Weight (1000 lbs)
[, 7]	qsec	1/4 mile time
[, 8]	vs	Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)
[, 9]	am	Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
[,10]	gear	Number of forward gears

### Exploratory data analyses of multivariate data

-  Hard
-  Necessary
-  Often generates quite a few plots before you identify one that you can keep

---

### One simple trick

Pairs plots!

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r pairs1, fig.show="hide"}
library(GGally)
GGally::ggpairs(mtcars)
```

]
.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label = "pairs1", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
```

]
]

---

* Evidently `vs`, `am`, `gear` and maybe `cyl` should be cast to factors

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r pairs2, fig.show="hide"}
mtcars = mtcars %>% mutate(across(c(vs, am, gear, cyl), factor))
GGally::ggpairs(mtcars)
```

]
.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label = "pairs2", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
```

]
]

---

- Let's suppose we wanted to determine which variables affect fuel 
  consumption (the `mpg` variable in the dataset).
- `cyl`, `disp`, `hp`, `drat`, `wt` all appear to be correlated with `mpg`
- `vs`, `am` and possibly `gear` could have distributional differences, as well

---
class: code70

- To begin, we'll look at the association between the variables log-weight 
  and mpg

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  xlab("Weight") +
  ylab("Miles Per Gallon")
```
    
- It seems that log-weight is negatively associated with mpg.
- It seems that the data approximately fall on a line.

---

### OLS fits in R

1. Make sure you have the explanatory variables in the format you want:
   ```{r}
   submt = mtcars %>% mutate(logwt = log(wt))
   ```
2. Use `lm()`
   ```{r}
   lmout = lm(mpg ~ logwt, data = submt)
   lmtide = tidy(lmout)
   select(lmtide, term, estimate)
   ```

---

### `lm` syntax

```r
lm(response ~ pred1 + pred2*pred3, data = data) 
```
Finds the OLS estimates of the following model: 

> response = $\beta_0+ \beta_1\text{pred1} + \beta_2\text{pred2} + \beta_{3}\text{pred3}+ \beta_{23}\text{pred2} * \text{pred3}$ + error
  
The `data` argument tells `lm()` where to find the response and 
  explanatory variables.

---

###  Formula syntax

*  `x:z` form the interaction between `x` and `z` -- this is element-by-element times if at least `x` or `z` is continuous, otherwise it is an outer-product.
*  `x*z` form interactions and include main effects. Equivalent to `x + z + x:z`
*  `+ 0` or `- 1` exclude an intercept term, or `- x` exclude `x` if included otherwise.
*  `(x + z + u)^2` form all two-way interactions and main effects with `x`, `z`, `u`.
*  `I(x - 10)` or `I(x^2)` -- perform arithmetic operations that use `+`, `-`, `*`, `^`, etc, on a variable "on-the-fly" in the formula.   Can also just transform before you model.
*  `y ~ .` every variable in the data, except the response `y`.

### Example

.alert[But don't do this without thinking!]

```{r}
tidy(lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars))
```


For a predictive goal, probably should use some method that does shrinkage and basis expansion.  For inference, need to consider putative casual models.

---


- Use `broom::glance()` function to get the estimated standard deviation, $R^2$, and information criteria. It's the value
  in the `sigma` column.
    ```{r}
    glance(lmout)
    ```

# Prediction (Interpolation)

- **Interpolation**: Making estimates/predictions within the range of the data.
- **Extrapolation**: Making estimates/predictions outside the range of the data.
- Interpolation is fine. Extrapolation is dangerous.
.question[why?]

---

- Interpolation
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = submt, mapping = aes(x = logwt, y = mpg)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_abline(slope = coef(lmout)[2], intercept = coef(lmout)[1], lwd = 1, col = "blue", alpha = 1/2) +
      geom_segment(data = data.frame(x    = 1, 
                                     xend = 1,
                                     y    = 0,
                                     yend = coef(lmout)[1] + 1 * coef(lmout)[2]),
                   mapping = aes(x = x, xend = xend, y = y, yend = yend), 
                   lty = 2, color = "red", lwd = 1) +
      geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, alpha = 1/2) +
      ylab("MPG") +
      xlab("Log-weight")
    ```

---

- Extrapolation
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = submt, mapping = aes(x = logwt, y = mpg)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_abline(slope = coef(lmout)[2], intercept = coef(lmout)[1], lwd = 1, col = "blue", alpha = 1/2) +
      geom_segment(data = data.frame(x    = 3, 
                                     xend = 3,
                                     y    = 0,
                                     yend = coef(lmout)[1] + 3 * coef(lmout)[2]),
                   mapping = aes(x = x, xend = xend, y = y, yend = yend), 
                   lty = 2, color = "red", lwd = 1) +
      geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, alpha = 1/2) +
      ylab("MPG") +
      xlab("Log-weight")
    ```

---

## Why is extrapolation dangerous?

1. Not sure if the linear relationship is the same outside the range of
   the data (because we don't have data there to see the relationship).
2. Not sure if the variability is the same outside the range of the 
   data (because we don't have data there to see the variability).

---

### Make a prediction:

1. You need a data frame with the exact same
   variable name as the explanatory variable. 
   ```{r}
   newdf = tribble(~logwt,
                   1, 
                   1.5)
   ```
2. Then you use the `predict()` function to obtain predictions.
   ```{r}
   newdf = newdf %>%
     mutate(predictions = predict(object = lmout, newdata = newdf))
   ```

## Assumptions and Violations

- In the linear model, you can trade assumptions for inference:

- Assumptions in *decreasing* order of importance
  1. **Independence** - The knowledge of the value of one observation does not 
     give you any information on the value of another.
  2. **Linearity** - The relationship looks like a straight line.
  3. **Equal Variance** - The spread is the same for every value of $x$
  4. **Normality** - The distribution of the errors isn't too skewed and there aren't 
     any *too* extreme points. (Only an issue if you have outliers and a 
     small number of observations because thanks be to the 
     [central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem)).

---

### What do we lose when violated?

  1. **Linearity** violated - Linear regression line does not pick up actual 
     conditional expectation.  As a linear approximation, the results will be sensitive to the particular $x$ sampled.
  2. **Independence** violated - Linear regression line is unbiased, but standard 
     errors can be badly off.
  3. **Equal Variance** violated - Linear regression line is unbiased, but standard 
     errors are off. Your $p$-values may be too small, or too large.
  4. **Normality** violated - Only an issue if your sample size is "small".  Unstable results if outliers are present.  Your $p$-values may be too small, or too large.
     
.question[What assumptions are made about the distribution of the 
  explanatory variable (the $x_i$'s)?]

---
  
## Evaluating Independence

- Think about the problem.
  - Were different responses measured on the same observational/experimental unit?
  - Were data collected in groups?

- Non-independence: The temperature today and the temperature 
  tomorrow. If it is warm today, it is probably warm tomorrow.

-  Non-independence: You are measuring properties of 500 single cells isolated from 3 mice.  Because the cells within a given mouse are probably similar, each cell is not independent.

### Evaluating other assumptions via residual diagnostics

- Obtain the residuals by using `augment()` from broom. They will be the
  `.resid` variable.
    ```{r}
    aout = augment(lmout)
    glimpse(aout)
    ```

- For inference, consider:
    - residuals $r_i$ vs $\hat{y}_i$.
    - residuals $r_i$ vs response $y_i$
    - residuals $r_i$ vs explanatory variable $x_i$
 
---
  
### Potential remedies

1. Linearity Violated: Try a transformation. If the relationship looks 
   curved and monotone (i.e. either always increasing or always decreasing) then 
   try a log transformation.
2. Independence Violated: Try a two-step procedure (that collapses over repeated measures) or ke longitudinal data analysis.
3. Equal Variance Violated: If the relationship is also curved and monotone, 
   try a log transformation on the response variable. Use a bootstrap.  Or stay tuned for en you learn about sandwich estimation.
4. Normality Violated: Don't trust prediction intervals 
   (confidence intervals are fine).

### Example 1: A perfect residual plot

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Fit]
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
set.seed(1)
x = rnorm(100, sd = 1)
y = x + rnorm(100)
lmout = lm(y ~ x)
res_vec = resid(lmout)
fit_vec = fitted(lmout)
qplot(x, y, xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", main = "Raw Data") + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Residual]
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
qplot(fit_vec, res_vec, xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Residual Plot") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```
]
]

---

### Verify

- `r emo::ji('check')` Means are straight lines
- `r emo::ji('check')` Residuals seem to be centered at 0 for all $x$
- `r emo::ji('check')` Variance looks equal for all $x$
- `r emo::ji('check')` Everything looks perfect (too perfect...`r emo::ji("thinking")`)

---

### Example 2: Curved Monotone Relationship, Equal Variances

- Simulate data:
    ```{r, output.lines = 7}
    set.seed(1)
    x = rexp(100)
    x = x - min(x) + 0.5
    y = log(x) * 20 + rnorm(100, sd = 4)
    (df_fake = tibble(x, y))
    ```

---

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Fit]
```{r, echo = FALSE}
lmout = lm(y ~ x)
res_vec = resid(lmout)
fit_vec = fitted(lmout)
qplot(x, y, xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", main = "Raw Data")+ geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Residual]
```{r, echo = FALSE}
qplot(fit_vec, res_vec, xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Residual Plot") + geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```
]
]

---

### Check

- `r emo::ji("x")` Curved (but always increasing) relationship between $x$ and $y$.
- `r emo::ji("check")` Variance looks equal for all $x$
- `r emo::ji("x")` Residual plot has a parabolic shape.
- **Solution**: These indicate a $\log$ transformation of $x$ could help.
    ```{r}
    df_fake %>%
      mutate(logx = log(x)) ->
      df_fake
    lm_fake = lm(y ~ logx, data = df_fake)
    ```

---

### Example 3: Curved Non-monotone Relationship, Equal Variances

- Simulate data:
    ```{r}
    set.seed(1)
    x = rnorm(100)
    y = -x^2 + rnorm(100)
    df_fake = tibble(x, y)
    ```

---

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Fit]
```{r, echo = FALSE}
lmout = lm(y ~ x)
res_vec = resid(lmout)
fit_vec = fitted(lmout)
qplot(x, y, xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", main = "Raw Data")+ geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Residual]
```{r, echo = FALSE}
qplot(fit_vec, res_vec, xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Residual Plot") + geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```
]
]


---

### Verify

- `r emo::ji("x")` Curved relationship between $x$ and $y$
- `r emo::ji("x")` Sometimes the relationship is increasing, sometimes it is decreasing.
- `r emo::ji("check")`  Variance looks equal for all $x$
- `r emo::ji("x")` Residual plot has a parabolic form.
- **Solution**: Include a squared term in the model (or use a gam or spline)
    ```{r}
    lmout = lm(y ~ I(x^2), data = df_fake)
    ```

---

### Example 4: Curved Relationship, Variance Increases with $Y$

- Simulate data:
    ```{r}
    set.seed(1)
    x = rnorm(100)
    y = exp(x + rnorm(100, sd = 1/2))
    df_fake = tibble(x, y)
    ```

---

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Fit]
```{r, echo = FALSE}
lmout = lm(y ~ x)
res_vec = resid(lmout)
fit_vec = fitted(lmout)
qplot(x, y, xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", main = "Raw Data")+ geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r, echo = FALSE}
qplot(fit_vec, res_vec, xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Residual Plot") + geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```
]
]

---

### Verify

- `r emo::ji("x")` Curved relationship between $x$ and $y$
- `r emo::ji("x")` Variance looks like it increases as $y$ increases
- `r emo::ji("x")` Residual plot has a parabolic form.
- `r emo::ji("x")` Residual plot variance looks larger to the right and smaller to the left.
- **Solution**: Take a log-transformation of $y$.
    ```{r}
    df_fake %>%
      mutate(logy = log(y)) ->
      df_fake
    lm_fake = lm(logy ~ x, data = df_fake)
    ```

---

### Example 5: Linear Relationship, Equal Variances, Skewed Distribution

Simulate data:
```{r}
set.seed(1)
x = runif(200)
y = 15 * x + rexp(200, 0.2)
```

---

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Fit]
```{r, echo = FALSE}
lmout = lm(y ~ x)
res_vec = resid(lmout)
fit_vec = fitted(lmout)
qplot(x, y, xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", main = "Raw Data")+ geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Residual]
```{r, echo = FALSE}
qplot(fit_vec, res_vec, xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Residual Plot") + geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```
]
]

---

### Verify

- `r emo::ji("check")` Straight line relationship between $x$ and $y$.
- `r emo::ji("check")` Variances about equal for all $x$
- `r emo::ji("x")` Skew for all $x$
- `r emo::ji("x")` Residual plots show skew.
- **Solution**: Do nothing, but report skew, or use a bootstrap or robust standard errors

---

### Example 6: Linear Relationship, Unequal Variances

- Simulate data:
    ```{r}
    set.seed(1)
    x = runif(100) * 10
    y = 0.85 * x + rnorm(100, sd = (x - 5) ^ 2)
    df_fake = tibble(x, y)
    ```

---

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Fit]
```{r, echo = FALSE}
lmout = lm(y ~ x)
res_vec = resid(lmout)
fit_vec = fitted(lmout)
qplot(x, y, xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", main = "Raw Data")+ geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")

```{r, echo = FALSE}
qplot(fit_vec, res_vec, xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Residual Plot") + geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```
]
]

---

### Verify
- `r emo::ji("check")` Linear relationship between $x$ and $y$.
- `r emo::ji("x")` Variance is different for different values of $x$.
- **Solution**: The modern solution is bootstrap or use sandwich estimates of the standard errors
    ```{r}
    rob_fit = estimatr::lm_robust(y ~ x, data = df_fake)
    tidy(rob_fit)
    ```

# Interpreting coefficients when you log

---

### Log `x` 

Generally, when you use logs, you interpret associations on a 
  *multiplicative* scale instead of an *additive* scale.

No log:
- Model: $E[y_i] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$
- Observations that differ by 1 unit in $x$ tend to differ by $\beta_1$ units in $y$.

Log $x$:
- Model: $E[y_i] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log_2(x_i)$
- Observations that are twice as large in $x$ tend to differ by $\beta_1$ units in $y$.

---

### log `y` 

Log $y$:
- Model: $E[\log_2(y_i)] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$
- Observations that differ by 1 unit in $x$ tend to be $2^{\beta_1}$ times larger in $y$. 

Log both:
- Model: $E[\log_2(y_i)] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log_2(x_i)$
- Observations that are twice as large in $x$ tend to be $2^{\beta_1}$ times larger in $y$. 

.footnote[Note: we commit statistical abuse here, since $\exp \left[ \text{E}(\log(Y) | X) \right] \neq \text{E}(Y | X)$, ie, `exp` doesn't commute through the expectation. Though the delta method says this is the 1st order approximation.

## When it doubt, predict it out!

With interaction models, it's easy to trick yourself.  But you can also make predictions to check your understanding.

us_lmout = lm(lifeExp ~ year, data = usdf)
tidy_uslm = tidy(us_lmout)
tidy_uslm
```

---

- So each year, the US has been increasing its life expectancy by 
  `r tidy_uslm$estimate[2]` years.
  
- How can we get these coefficient estimates for each country?

--

- We could fit an interaction between year and country but:
  -  Have to pick a reference country, or faff about with sum-to-zero contrasts, then recover the "missing level".
  -  This would assumes identical error terms across all countries -- undesirable.

###  Many linear models to the rescue!

Also known as `group_by` with list columns.  This is a common, and very useful pattern for me, but it might be because I am a degenerate bioinformatician and am always dealing with multiplicity.

The concept is:

1. `group_by` lets us `summarize` data by subsets.
2. Model fits can go into a list.
3. data frames can contain lists: a data frame is a list that quacks like a matrix, and lists can contain more lists...
4. `tidyr::unnest()` function will let us extract the goods.

---

## General recipe

```{r, eval = FALSE}
many_fits = gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(fit = fit_model(across())) #<<

tidied_output = many_fits %>% 
  rowwise()  %>% #<<
  mutate(df = list( #<<
    post_process(fit) #<<
    ))

unnested_output = tidied_output %>% 
  tidyr::unnest(cols = c(df)) #<<
```

*  `fit_model`: data.frame in, length-1 list out
*  `post_process`: unboxed list element in, a data frame wrapped as a list out
*  extract and combine with `unnest`.

---

### Specific example

```{r, output.lines = 7}
fit_model = function(data) {
  fit = lm(lifeExp ~ I(year-1990), data)
  list(fit)
}

many_fits = gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country, continent) %>%
  summarize(fit = fit_model(across())) %>% 
  ungroup()
many_fits
```


---

### Output

Now we can see the model fit in Japan:

```{r}
filter(many_fits, country == 'Japan')$fit[[1]] %>% tidy()
```

or Senegal
```{r}
filter(many_fits, country == 'Senegal')$fit[[1]] %>% tidy()

```

---

### Notes

1. Use `across()` to pass the data frame, subset to the current group to our fit function.
2. We have to do an unlisting operation to extract the lm object itself.  Without we get a length-1 list:
   ```{r}
   filter(many_fits, country == 'Senegal')$fit 
   ```
   
---
   
3.We have to wrap the `lm` output as a list:
```{r, error=TRUE}
fit_not_list = function(data) {
 fit = lm(lifeExp ~ I(year-1990), data)
 fit
}

many_fits = gapminder %>% 
 group_by(country, continent) %>%
 summarize(fit = fit_not_list(across()))
```

---
  
### Add model summaries

To really cook with this pattern, we want to extract various components from the model into a long data frame, suitable for further dplying or ggploting.  

The essential rule here is that we can mutate new list column with operations that are

>  `n-list` in and `n-list` out


---

### `n-list` in and `n-list` out!

By `n-list` I mean a length-n list.

`purrr::map` (and `lapply`) support this sort of implicit iteration, so we definitely can fall back on them. 

We can use also the `rowwise()` operator in dplyr, which lets us just write a function that takes an "unboxed" element of the list in and writes an `n-list` out.


---

### Manipulating list columns

```{r}
(df = tibble( x = 1:3, 
             y = list('a', c('bb', 'cc'), 'ddd')))

str(df$y)
```

Verify: `y` is a list.

---

### Manipulating list columns

Suppose we want to count the number of characters in each element of `y`. `nchar` doesn't quite work:
```{r}
nchar(df$y)
```

Need `lapply` or `purrr::map`
```{r}
purrr::map(df$y, nchar)
```

---

### Finally, using mutate

```{r}
(df = df %>% mutate(nchar = purrr::map(y, nchar)))
```


---

### With purrr


Ok, back to our set of `lm` fits:

```{r}
many_fits = many_fits %>% mutate(tidyout = map(fit, tidy))
many_fits
```

---

### With rowwise

```{r}
many_fits = many_fits %>% rowwise() %>% mutate(augmentout = list(augment(fit)))
many_fits
```

---

### Unnesting

`tidy::unnest()` takes data frame list columns, extracts them, and rbinds them, and preserves the remaining columns, repeating these as necessary to get the dimension to match

```{r}
(df %>% unnest(cols = c(y, nchar)))
```

---

### Unnest our fits

```{r}
many_fits_coef = many_fits %>% unnest(cols = c(tidyout))
many_fits_coef
```

---

### Finally


What is the distribution of 1990-estimated life expectancy?

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r country-intercept, fig.show='hide'}
intercept = many_fits_coef %>% 
  filter(term == '(Intercept)') %>% 
  arrange(desc(estimate)) %>%
  mutate(country = fct_inorder(country))

to_show = intercept %>% group_by(continent) %>% summarize(country = country[seq(from = 1, to = length(country), by = 5)]) %>% ungroup()

intercept %>%
ggplot(aes(y = country, x = estimate, xmin = estimate - std.error, xmax = estimate + std.error)) + 
  geom_pointrange() + 
  scale_y_discrete(breaks = to_show$country) + 
  facet_grid(continent ~ ., scales = 'free_y', space = 'free')
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r, ref.label = 'country-intercept', echo = FALSE, out.width='70%'}

```

]]
---

- You can check all of the models' qualities by looking at the residuals

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r country-resid, fig.show='hide'}
augment_df = many_fits %>% 
  unnest(cols = c(augmentout)) %>%
  mutate(year = `I(year - 1990)` + 1990)

augment_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = .std.resid, group = country)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 1/3) +
  facet_wrap(.~continent) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, col = "blue") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Residual")
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r, ref.label = 'country-resid', echo = FALSE, out.width='70%'}

```
Actually, there's a pretty severe indication that linearity is being violated!
