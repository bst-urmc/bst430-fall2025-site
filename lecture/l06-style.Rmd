## Course style guide

.hand[.light-blue[But seriously...]]

Applying a sensible and consistent style:
- reduces bugs and increases the maintainability of your code.
- Allows a temporary illusion of control over an otherwise chaotic and indifferent universe.
--

- Style guide for this course is a fork of the Tidyverse style guide: https://urmc-bst.github.io/style/
- There's more to it than what we'll cover now,  we'll do a recap later in the semester

---

## File names and code chunk labels

- Do not use spaces in file names, use `-` or `_` to separate words
- Use all lowercase letters

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
ucb-admit.csv

# Bad
UCB Admit.csv
```

---

## Object names

- Use `_` to separate words in object names
- Use informative but short object names
- Avoid reusing object names within an analysis
- If you need an uninformative temporary variable, perhaps you should be using a pipeline.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
acs_employed

# Bad
acs.employed
acs2
acs_subset
acs_subsetted_for_males
```

---

## Spacing

-  In general, put a space before and after all infix operators (=, +, -, =, etc.), and when naming arguments in function calls.
-  Exception: when omitting a space improve clarity about order of operations.
-  Always put a space after a comma, and never before (just like in regular English).

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
average = mean(feet * 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)

# Also OK
average = mean(feet*12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)

# Bad
average=mean(feet*12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)
```

---

## ggplot

- Always end a line with `+`
- Always indent the next line

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

---

## Long lines

- Limit your code to 80 characters per line. This fits comfortably on a printed page with a reasonably sized font.

- Take advantage of RStudio editor's auto formatting for indentation at line breaks.

---

## Assignment

- Use `=` not `<-` (unless you are doing something clever...and generally avoid being clever.)

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
x = 2

# Bad
x <- 2
```

* This is a provocative take.

---
## `<-` Assignment

.pull-left[
.blue[###Pros]

*  Allows chained and in-place assignment.
```{r}
x <- y <- 10
paste0("x = ", x, " and y = ", y)
```
*  Could reduce confusion between `==` and 
`=`?
*  Looks cooler?
]
.pull-right[
.orange[### Cons]

*  It causes confusion:
```{r}
y = 0
cube_root = function(x) return(x^(1/3))
cube_root(y <- 8) #<<
y
```
]

---

## More cons

* `<-` is an extra keystroke
*  If you separate the `<` from the `-` you can get a legal line of code that doesn't do want you expect
*  Or vice versa!

```{r}
x = 10
y = 1
if(x<-y){ #<<
  print("x is smaller than -y?")
}
```
* [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1741820/what-are-the-differences-between-and-assignment-operators-in-r) is a [matter](https://colinfay.me/r-assignment/) [of](https://win-vector.com/2013/04/23/prefer-for-assignment-in-r/) [debate](http://www.separatinghyperplanes.com/2018/02/why-you-should-use-and-never.html).

---

## Magic `numeric()` or string literals

* Avoid repeated use of literal constants

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# bad 
volume = 3.14159 * r^3
area = 4/3 * 3.14159 * r^2

# good
pi = 3.14159
volume = pi * r^3
area = 4/3 * pi * r^2
```

---

## Convoluted logical expressions

* Logical operators take the `TRUE` path when the condition evaluates to `TRUE`

--
* Corollary: never need to test `==TRUE` or `!=FALSE`.

```{r}
# Bad
ifelse(is.na(x) == TRUE, 0, 1)

# Good
ifelse(is.na(x), 0, 1)
```

---

## Naughty shadowing

* Avoid shadowing common R functions: `c`, `t`, `T`, `F`
```{r}
c = 'uhoh'
c("uhoh", c)
```

* Corollary: don't use the sketchy `T` and `F` shortcuts for `TRUE` and `FALSE`:

```{r}
F = TRUE
if(F) print("This shouldn't happen. I have broken the universe.")
```

## Linting on github

*  Your labs and homeworks will have "lint" (commentary based on the style guide) provided automatically via the (dark) magic of github Actions.
*  Having lint-free (or as close as practical) at the time of final submission will be a part of your grade.
*  The style guide and what I wrote here is ultimately the controlling source. It a bit more lenient then the lint (eg infix spacing).
*  So if you have no lint warnings, you'll get full credit on this criteria.

--

* Much of the linting can be handled by Rstudio -> Code -> Reformat code!
