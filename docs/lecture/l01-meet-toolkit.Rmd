# Candy

1. Take 10 candies from the bag
2. Weigh them (make sure scale is tared and in grams)
3. Record your weight in grams somewhere.  We'll need it again shortly.
4. Replace the 10 candies
5. Pass the scale and bag to the next person

---


## Reproducibility checklist

One of recurring themes in this class will be .alert[reproducibility].
Near-term goals:

- Can you reproduce tables and figures from the code and data?
- Can someone else reproduce  tables and figures from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear **why** it was done? 
(e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)

Long-term goals:

- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

## Signing at the beginning increases honesty in comparison to signing at the end 
or the Cambria / Calibri Incident


---

<img src = "l01/img/shu-2012.png">

In 2012, a team of researchers used laboratory and field experiments to conclude that  signing at the beginning rather than at the end of a self-report significantly reduces dishonesty.

???

Lab experiments (undergrads) and a field experiment with a car insurance company.  In the latter, there was a baseline measure of mileage then people were randomized into "before" vs after signing.  Comparing baseline self-report to post-treatment self-report identifies an unbiased treatment effect.

<img src = "l01/img/kristal-2020.png">

--
In 2020, many of these same researchers published a paper disavowing this finding.  

--
What happened?

???

Lots of things including a failure of a randomization, but mostly evidence of fraud 

---

## Near duplicated observations

.pull-left[
-  In the 2020 paper, the data from 2012 was posted (finally) as well, and something curious was noted about the fonts.
-  In many cases, near duplicate observations were found, with the Cambria observations being `runif(0, 1000)` larger than the Calibri pair.
-  See this [datacolada](http://datacolada.org/98) post for details.

# Lessons learned

-  Avoid doing any serious work in excel, and
- especially don't use it to fabricate data.
-  Making it easier reproduce analyses may reduce the temptation to commit fraud.
-  But in most cases, programming errors rather than fraud are a greater risk.  .alert[Reproducible analyses help here too!]

---

## Toolkit

![toolkit](l01/img/toolkit.png)

- Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R
- Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ R Markdown
- Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub
---

class: center, middle

# Github and git


---

## How do we collaborate?

- The statistical programming language we'll use is R
- The software we use to interface with R is RStudio
- But how do I get you the course materials that you can build on for your assignments?
    + ❌ We're not going to email code back and forth, that would be a mess!
    + ❌ Blackboard has harsh 2007 vibes.
---

## GitHub accounts

- If you have a GitHub account and sit back and relax for a minute.
- If you do not yet have a GitHub account, create one now at https://github.com/. 
- Tips for selecting a username:<sup>1</sup>
    - Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.
    - Reuse your username from other contexts if you can, e.g., Twitter or Slack.
    - Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
    - Shorter is better than longer.
    - Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible.
    - Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence.

# Join the classroom

- Once you have a github account, please check your email or [blackboard](learn.rochester.edu) and click the link to join the github classroom.

---

## Version control

- We introduced GitHub as a platform for collaboration

- But it's much more than that...

- It's actually designed for version control

---

## Versioning

## Why do we need version control?

# Git and GitHub tips

- Git is a version control system -- like “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word on steroids. GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like DropBox but much, much better).
- There are hundreds git commands -- it's used for the Linux kernel for chrissakes.  But 95% of the time you will only need five commands: `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull` and adjust the `remote` repositories you sync with.
- We will be doing Git things and interfacing with GitHub through RStudio, but if you google for help you might come across methods for doing these things in the command line -- you can skip that and move on to the next resource for the moment.
- [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/)  is a great resource and reference for working with git and R.

## Add your weights the CandyWeight assignment

DEMO!

---

class: center, middle

## Analyze the weights

DEMO!

---

## Recap: What did we just do?

- Locate a repository on **GitHub**

- Clone and open the project in **RStudio**

- Run the analysis using **R Markdown**

- Edit the analysis to add the true weight

- Re-run the analysis using **R Markdown**

# R and RStudio

---

## What is R/RStudio?

- R is a statistical programming language

- RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)

---

class: center, middle

## Let's take a tour - R / RStudio

Demo!

---

Concepts introduced:

- Opening a project
- Console
- Using R as a calculator
- Environment
- Loading and viewing a data frame
- Accessing a variable in a data frame
- R functions
- Getting help

---

## R essentials

A short list (for now):

- Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r eval=FALSE}
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

--

- Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
dataframe$var_name
```

--

- Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

---

## What is the Tidyverse?

.pull-left[
![](l01/img/tidyverse.png)
]

.pull-right[
<center>
<a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse.org</a>
</center>

- The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. 
- All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common syntax.

# R Markdown

---


## R Markdown

- Fully reproducible reports -- each time you knit the analysis is ran from the beginning

- Simple markdown syntax for text

- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks (`), narrative goes outside of chunks

---

class: center, middle

## Let's take a tour -- R Markdown

Demo!

---

## R Markdown tips

- Keep the [R Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf) and Markdown Quick Reference (Help -> Markdown Quick Reference) handy, we'll refer to it often as the course progresses

- The workspace of your R Markdown document is separate from the Console

---

## How will we use R Markdown?

- Every assignment / report / project / etc. is an R Markdown document

- You'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with

- The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester



<!-- Accessing the CandyWeight repository from rstudio cloud

1.  From the BST430 workspace select .blue[New Project] -> .blue[New Project from git repository]
2.  Paste in the github link to your assigned version of the CandyWeight, eg https://github.com/URMC-BST/candyweight-yourgithubID
3.  Now we need to make it so that rstudio knows about your github account.

1.  https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/git-credentials.html

-->

---

## What went wrong with our sampling scheme?

-  What went wrong?
--

-  **Ascertainment bias**! Not all types of candy were equally likely to be sampled, and the variable of interest was a function of the sampling probability
-  What are some other settings with ascertainment bias?
--

-  How do we fix it?
--

-  Change the sampling scheme to ensure uniform random sampling.  .small[Define the **sampling frame** (candies numbered 1-100), and a scheme to cover it (a random number generator)]
-  What if I told you that there were 51 kisses, 25 twix, 15 milky way, 6 kit kat and 3 Hershey bars?
--

-  We could change the estimation procedure to account for this. .small[Either weight the samples inversely by their propensity to be ascertained, or stratify the sampling (eg by candy type) and adjust the estimate.]
