## Agenda

1.  Reshaping a single data frame
2.  Joining multiple data frames

## Announcements

1.  Office hours Friday moved to noon (or by appointment) and will be virtual.
<br>
1.  Make sure that you don't have any "M" status in your homework 1 -- these are files with modifications that haven't been pushed to github.  I have observed that some people  haven't pushed the .md files.
2.  If you are having troubles, I am available for consult after class.
3.  Remember that you can always make corrections to an assignment for partial credit.

The goal of tidyr is to help you tidy your data via

- **pivoting** between wide and long data
- splitting and combining character columns
- **nesting** and unnesting columns
- clarifying how `NA`s should be treated

## Your turn.

[Quiz 1](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_uw7gkcSP1hHi502dg6Nx-E1b1aFGYPY3t4dyZEySUiI5xw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

1. Suppose you have data (available with `library(tidyr)`) on TB incidence as follows:
```{r}
table2
```
Reshape this so that for each year and country, cases and population appear in separate columns.
2. Consider this table containing cases by year:
```{r}
table4a
```
Reshape this so that you can plot the year vs the case count with ggplot.

---

## Other tidyr functionality

* `nest()` and `unnest()` let you embed or expand list columns in a data frame.  .alert[This can be extremely powerful.] But it best illustrated with an example...in a couple weeks.
*  `fill()` imputes missing values by carrying observations down or up in a data frame
*  `complete()` makes implicit missing combinations of variables explicit.  Sometimes useful when building contingency tables.
*  `separate()` and `separate_rows()` can fix some issues with multiple values packed into the same cell of a table.

- `left_join()`: all rows from x
- `right_join()`: all rows from y
- `full_join()`: all rows from both x and y
- `semi_join()`: all rows from x where there are matching values in y, keeping just columns from x
- `inner_join()`: all rows from x where there are matching values in y, return 
all combination of multiple matches in the case of multiple matches

* `flights` connects to `airports` in two ways: via the `origin` and
  `dest` variables.
* `flights` connects to `weather` via `origin` (the location), and
  `year`, `month`, `day` and `hour` (the time).

## Your turn

[Quiz 2](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQnfY6QXsXhIomcQ92dW70DSpYtZq-Yql4dlUvIUrE7FwYZg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

1.  Imagine you wanted to draw (approximately) the route each plane flies from
    its origin to its destination. What variables would you need? What tables
    would you need to combine?

---
## Full solution

[code](l05a/flights_join.R)

---
## Keys


The variables that connect pairs of tables are called __keys__. A key is a variable (or set of variables) that uniquely identifies an observation. 

For example, each plane is uniquely identified by its `tailnum`, but identify an observation in `weather` you need five variables: `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, and `origin`.

There are two types of keys:

* A __primary key__ uniquely identifies an observation in its own table.
  For example, `planes$tailnum` is a primary key because it uniquely identifies
  each plane in the `planes` table.

* A __foreign key__ uniquely identifies an observation in another table.
  For example, the `flights$tailnum` is a foreign key because it appears in the 
  `flights` table where it matches each flight to a unique plane.

---
class: code70
## Keys

The uniqueness of the keys is an invariant.  Let's test it: 

```{r}
planes %>% 
  count(tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)

weather %>% 
  count(year, month, day, hour, origin) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

## Where's the primary key in `flights`?

.pull-left[
Is he in the flight number?
```{r}
flights %>% 
  count(year, month, day, flight) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```
Nope.
]
.pull-right[
Is he hiding in the plane tailnum?
```{r}
flights %>% 
  count(year, month, day, tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```
Not here either.
]

## There he is!

```{r}
flights %>% 
  count(year, month, day, flight, origin, carrier) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

It always pays to ask (but verify!)

## Surrogate keys

If a table lacks a primary key, it's often useful to add one with `mutate()` and `row_number()`. That makes it easier to match observations if you've done some filtering and want to check back in with the original data. This is called a __surrogate key__.

## A tiny bit of database theory

Tidy data sets will obey [various .alert[normal forms]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization).  The most basic is that there exists a .alert[primary keys] obeying a uniqueness and existence constraint.

Highly normalized data sets also obey redundancy constraints that entail factoring (dividing) a data set into multiple tables. Unless you are a database engineer,  complete normalization is often just a stumbling block to analyze data.  

However, it can be very helpful to think about dividing data into a primary table of **facts**, and auxiliary tables of **dimensions**.  The facts represent frequently-updated observations and the dimensions are covariates that can be shared across observations and should change slowly, if at all.<sup>1</sup>
