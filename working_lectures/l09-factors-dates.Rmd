# Data classes

---

## Data classes

Recall: we talked about *types* (elements) and  *classes* (compounds)

- Vectors are like Lego building blocks

--
- We stick them together to build more complicated constructs, e.g. *representations of data*

--
- The **class** attribute relates to the S3 class of an object which determines its behaviour
  - You don't need to worry about what S3 classes really mean, but you can read more about it [here](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html#s3-classes) if you're curious

--
- Examples: factors, dates, and data frames
  
Here's the [R code in this lecture](l09/factors-dates.R)

---

## Factors

R uses factors to handle categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values

```{r}
x = factor(c("BS", "MS", "PhD", "MS"))
x
```

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
typeof(x)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
class(x)
```
]


---

## More on factors

We can think of factors like character (level labels) and an integer (level numbers) glued together

```{r}
glimpse(x)
as.integer(x)
```

---

## Dates

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
y = ymd("2020-01-01")
y
typeof(y)
class(y)
```

---

## More on dates

We can think of dates like an integer (the number of days since the origin, 1 Jan 1970) and an integer (the origin) glued together

```{r}
as.integer(y)
as.integer(y) / 365 # roughly 50 yrs
```

# Working with factors

---

```{r include=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
flights_sml = flights %>% 
  select(origin:dest, year:dep_time, hour:minute) 
flights10 = flights_sml %>%
  semi_join(flights %>% count(dest) %>%
              mutate(rank = min_rank(-n)) %>% filter(rank<=15)) 
```

## Store and read data as character strings

```{r}
#a subest of the NYC flights with 15 biggest destinations
glimpse(flights10)
```

---

## But coerce when plotting

```{r out.width="60%"}
ggplot(flights10, mapping = aes(x = dest)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  coord_flip()
```

---

## Use forcats to manipulate factors

```{r out.width="55%", warning=FALSE}
library(forcats)
plt = flights10 %>% # assign plot to object #<<
  mutate(dest_fct = fct_infreq(dest)) %>% #<<
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = dest_fct)) +
  geom_bar()  + 
  coord_flip() + theme_minimal()
plt #print it #<<
```

---

## useful forcats functions

* Set factor levels by order of appearance `fct_inorder()`, numeric value `fct_inseq()`, number of observations `fct_infreq()`, 
* Reverse order of factor levels `fct_rev()`, make an arbitrary change `fct_relevel()`
* Combine factor levels by number of occurences `fct_lump_n()`, order statistic `fct_lump_min()`, or frequency `fct_lump_prop()`
* Recode/combine level names `fct_recode()`,  combine and drop levels `fct_collapse()`
* Set level order by covariate `fct_reorder()`
* Convert `NA` `fct_explicit_na()`

---

## Collapse rare categories

```{r}
plt %+% # #<< Replace plot data 
  (flights_sml %>%
  mutate(dest_fct = fct_lump_n(dest, 15) %>% #<<
           fct_infreq))
```

---

## Recode categories

```{r}
plt %+%
  (flights_sml %>%
  mutate(dest_fct = fct_recode(dest, 'Western NY' = 'ROC', #<<
                               'Western NY' = 'BUF',#<<
                               'Western NY' = 'SYR') %>% #<<
           fct_lump_n(15) %>% fct_infreq))
```

For more complicated recoding, consider encoding with a data frame and using a join.

## Make a date

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="65%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("l09/img/lubridate-not-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
- **lubridate** is the tidyverse-friendly package that makes dealing with dates a little easier
- It's installed with `install.packages("tidyverse")` but needs to be explicitly loaded with `library(lubridate)`
]

.hand[.light-blue[
we're just going to scratch the surface of working with dates in R here...
]]

---

.question[
Calculate and visualize the number of departures on any given date.
]


---

## Step 1. Construct dates

.midi[
```{r output.lines=7, warning=FALSE}
library(glue)

flights %>%
  mutate(
    date = glue("{year} {month} {day}") #<<
    ) %>% 
  relocate(date)
```
]

---

## Step 2. Count flights per date

.midi[
```{r}
flights %>%
  mutate(date = glue("{year} {month} {day}")) %>%
  count(date)
```
]

---

## Step 3. visualize flights per date

.midi[
```{r out.width="80%", fig.asp = 0.4}
flights %>%
  mutate(date = glue("{year} {month} {day}")) %>%
  count(date) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = n, group = 1)) +
  geom_line()
```
]

---

.hand[zooming in a bit... first 7 days `slice(1:7)`]

.question[
Why does 10 Jan come after 1 Jan?
]

.midi[
```{r out.width="80%", echo=FALSE, fig.asp = 0.4}
flights %>%
  mutate(date = glue("{year} {month} {day}")) %>%
  count(date) %>%
  slice(1:7) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = n, group = 1)) +
  geom_line()
```
]

---

## Step 1. *REVISED* Construct dates "as dates"

.midi[
```{r output.lines=7, warning=FALSE}
library(lubridate)

flights %>%
  mutate(
    date = ymd(glue("{year} {month} {day}")) #<<
    ) %>% 
  relocate(date)
```
]

---

## Step 2. Count flights per date

.midi[
```{r}
flights %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(glue("{year} {month} {day}"))) %>% 
  count(date)
```
]

---

## Step 3. visualize flights per date

.midi[
```{r out.width="80%", fig.asp = 0.4}
flights %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(glue("{year} {month} {day}"))) %>% 
  count(date) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = n, group = 1)) +
  geom_line()
```
]

---

## Flights by day of week

[code](l09/flights_day_of_week.R)

---

## Other lubridate date functions

*  Construct from month day year `mdy()`, or day month year `dmy()`
*  Extract or set components `month()`, `day()`, `year()`
*  Extract `quarter()` or day of week `weekdays()`
*  Extract or set day-of-year `yday()`, day-of-quarter `qday()`, day-of week `wday()`
*  Days elapsed between two dates: `date1 - date2`
*  Lead or lag: `date + days_to_lead`

# Date + Time

When you have a date + a time, then everything works as before, it just takes extra oomph to construct them:

```{r}
dmy_hms('22-Sep-2021 11:00:00')
```

--

... and you need to worry about the timezone `r emo::ji('scream_cat')`


```{r}
dmy_hms('22-Sep-2021 11:00:00', tz = 'America/New_York')
```

---

## When you only have / want the time?


```{r}
flights_sml = flights_sml %>% 
  mutate(time = hm(glue("{hour} {minute}"))) %>% #<<
  relocate(time)
flights_sml
```

---

## When do flights depart?

```{r}
ggplot(flights_sml, aes(x = time, fill = origin))
```

---

## `Period` needs special treatment in ggplot2

```{r}
ggplot(flights_sml, aes(x = time, fill = origin))+ 
  geom_density(alpha = .5) + 
  scale_x_time() #<<
```

---

### Probably under-smoothed, Weird Units

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r departure-time-plot, fig.show = 'hide'}
plt = ggplot(flights_sml, aes(x = time, after_stat(count), fill = origin)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .5, bw = 1800) + # 30*60 seconds #<<
  scale_x_time() + 
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = 
        sec_axis(trans = ~ .x/365*3600,  name = 'Departures/day/hour')) + #<<
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "Departures/year/second")
plt
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r, ref.label='departure-time-plot',  echo = FALSE, out.width="75%"}
```
]
]

class: code70

## Why bimodal?

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r departure-region-plot, fig.show = 'hide'}
flights_jn = flights_sml %>% 
  left_join(airports, c('dest' = 'faa')) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(lon)) %>% #missing puerto rico
  mutate(region = cut(lon, #<<
                      breaks = c(-158, -124, -104, -83, -66), # 5 breakpoints #<<
                      labels = c('HI/AK', 'West', 'Central', 'East'))) # 4 groups #<<

plt %+% flights_jn + 
  facet_wrap(~region, scales = 'free_y') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r, ref.label='departure-region-plot',  echo = FALSE, out.width="75%"}
```
]
]
