# Prediction

Here's the [R code in this lecture](l12/prediction-logistic.R)

The dataset is loaded in the openintro library


---

## Goal: Building a spam filter

- Data: Set of emails and we know if each email is spam/not and other features 
- Use logistic regression to predict the probability that an incoming email is spam
- Optimize our model by picking the model with the best predictive performance

--
- Building a model to predict the probability that an email is spam is only half of the battle! We also need a decision rule about which emails get flagged as spam (e.g. what probability should we use as our cutoff?)

--
- A simple approach: choose a single threshold probability and any email that exceeds that probability is flagged as spam

# Logistic regression

---

## Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)

- Logistic regression is a *generalized linear model(GLM)* used to model a binary categorical outcome using numerical and categorical predictors

- A GLM is an extension of the least squares linear model $E(Y_i|\mathbf{x}_i) = \mathbf{x}_i \beta$ and  $Y|\mathbf{x}_i ~ N(\mathbf{x}_i \beta, \sigma^2)$ generalizes to 
$$g(E(Y_i|x_i)) = \eta_i = \mathbf{x}_i \beta,$$ $Y|X \sim$ Exponential-Family, and $g$ is known as a **link** function.

- Whereby the glm allows non-linear effects in $\beta$, and since the conditional distribution of $Y|X$ can include all sorts of interesting families, it also permits non-constant residual variance.

---

### The Bernoulli GLM with logit link

- To finish specifying the Logistic model we just need to define a reasonable link function that connects $\eta_i$ to $p_i$: logit function

--
- **Logit function:** For $0\le p \le 1$

$$logit(p) = \log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$$


---

## Logit function, visualised

```{r echo=FALSE}
d = tibble(p = seq(0.001, 0.999, length.out = 1000)) %>%
  mutate(logit_p = log(p/(1-p)))

ggplot(d, aes(x = p, y = logit_p)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab("logit(p)") +
  labs(title = "logit(p) vs. p") + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = c(min(d$p), .25, .5, .75, max(d$p)))
```

---

## Properties of the logit

- The logit function takes a value between 0 and 1 and maps it to a value between $-\infty$ and $\infty$

--
- Inverse logit (aka expit) function:
$$g^{-1}(x) = \frac{\exp(x)}{1+\exp(x)} = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}$$

--
- The expit function takes a value between $-\infty$ and $\infty$ and maps it to a value between 0 and 1

--
- This formulation is also useful for interpreting the model, since the logit slope can be interpreted as the odds ratio of a success -- more on this later

---

## The logistic regression model

- Based on the three GLM criteria we have
  - $y_i|x_i \sim \text{Bern}(p_i)$
  - $\text{logit}(p_i) = \eta_i$
  - $\eta_i = \beta_0+\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \cdots + \beta_n x_{n,i}$

--
- From which we get

$$p_i = \frac{\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \cdots + \beta_k x_{k,i})}{1+\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \cdots + \beta_k x_{k,i})}$$
---

## Modeling spam

In R we fit a GLM in the same way as a linear model except we

- use `"glm"` instead of `"lm"` as the engine 

- define `family = "binomial"` for the link function to be used in the model

--

- When using `tidymodels`, specify the model with `logistic_reg()`

---

## Prediction

- The mechanics of prediction is **easy**:
  - Plug in values of predictors to the model equation
  - Calculate the predicted value of the response variable, $\hat{y}$

--
- Getting it right is **hard**!
  - There is no guarantee the model estimates you have are correct
  - Or that your model will perform as well with new data as it did with your sample data

---

## Underfitting and overfitting

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", warning = FALSE}
lm_fit = linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(y4 ~ x2, data = association)

loess_fit = loess(y4 ~ x2, data = association)

loess_overfit = loess(y4 ~ x2, span = 0.05, data = association)

association %>%
  select(x2, y4) %>%
  mutate(
    Underfit = augment(lm_fit$fit) %>% select(.fitted) %>% pull(),
    OK       = augment(loess_fit) %>% select(.fitted) %>% pull(),
    Overfit  = augment(loess_overfit) %>% select(.fitted) %>% pull(),
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols      = Underfit:Overfit,
    names_to  = "fit",
    values_to = "y_hat"
  ) %>%
  mutate(fit = fct_relevel(fit, "Underfit", "OK", "Overfit")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x2)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = y4), color = "darkgray") +
  geom_line(aes(y = y_hat, group = fit, color = fit), size = 1) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, color = NULL) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "plasma", end = 0.7)
```

---

## Spending our data

- Several steps to create a useful model: parameter estimation, model selection, performance assessment, etc.

- Doing all of this on the entire data we have available can lead to **overfitting**

- Allocate specific subsets of data for different tasks, as opposed to allocating the largest possible amount to the model parameter estimation only (which is what we've done so far)

# Splitting data

---

## Splitting data

- **Training set:**
  - Sandbox for model building 
  - Spend most of your time using the training set to develop the model
  - Majority of the data (usually 80%)
  
- **Testing set:**
  - Held in reserve to determine efficacy of one or two chosen models
  - Critical to look at it once, otherwise it becomes part of the modeling process
  - Remainder of the data (usually 20%)
  
---

## Performing the split

```{r}
# Fix random numbers by setting the seed 
# Enables analysis to be reproducible when random numbers are used 
set.seed(20211115)

# Put 80% of the data into the training set 
email_split = initial_split(email, prop = 0.80)

# Create data frames for the two sets:
train_data = training(email_split)
test_data  = testing(email_split)
```

.font70[`training` / `testing` aren't doing anything very fancy -- just using `sample_n` and then taking its complement, but this approach generalizes to more complicated ways to split our data.]

## Fit a model to the training dataset

```{r}
email_fit = logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(spam ~ . - from - sent_email - viagra - urgent_subj - winner - time, data = train_data, family = "binomial") #<<
```

.code50[
```{r}
email_fit
```
]

???

Dropping `from`, `sent_email` quells the warnings about predicted probabilities being 0/1. Actually some of these variables might have predictive power, but we would need a more sophisticated approach than logistic regression to use them

---

## Predict outcome on the testing dataset

```{r}
predict(email_fit, test_data)
```


---

## Predict probabilities on the testing dataset

```{r}
email_pred = predict(email_fit, test_data, type = "prob") %>%
  bind_cols(test_data %>% select(spam, time))

email_pred
```

---

## A closer look at predictions


```{r highlight.output=c(6, 10)}
email_pred %>%
  arrange(desc(.pred_1)) %>%
  print(n = 10)
```

---

## Evaluate the performance

# Feature engineering

---

## Feature engineering

- There are all sorts of ways to build predictive models of binary variables: random forests, support vector machines, neural networks, $k$ nearest neighbors, gradient boosting, ...

- In their own way, each learns the mapping $\hat f: \mathbf{x} \mapsto Y$

--
- But the variables $\mathbf{x}$ that go into the model and how they are represented are just as critical to success of the model

--
- **Feature engineering** allows us to get creative with our predictors in an effort to make them more useful for our model (to increase its predictive performance) 

-  How this engineering is done is part of the learned function $\hat f$, and needs to be accounted for when we evaluate our models.

---

## A simple approach: `mutate()`

```{r}
library(lubridate)
train_data %>%
  mutate(
    date = date(time),
    dow  = wday(time),
    month = month(time)
    ) %>%
  select(time, date, dow, month) %>%
  sample_n(size = 5) # shuffle to show a variety
```

???

time would be used a "seconds" since the epoch as a continuous variable, however this would not allow any flexibility about weekdays vs weekends, time of year, etc.

however, we would need to repeat this mutate on train / test independently, at a minimum this would not keep things D.R.Y.

It's actually even worse than that, in that some mutates (collapsing factors, scaling variables) have implicitly learned parameters -- if we don't account for this we can end up with data leaking between training and test or with garbage predictions in test


---

## Modeling workflow, revisited

- Create a **recipe** for feature engineering steps to be applied to the training data

--
- Fit the model to the training data after these steps have been applied

--
- Using the model estimates from the training data, predict outcomes for the test data

--
- Evaluate the performance of the model on the test data

# Building recipes


???

Fancy mutate statements that can be applied easily to both training / test
Actually, is building up and saving a set of functions (without evaluating them)

---

## Initiate a recipe

```{r initiate-recipe, results="hide"}
email_rec = recipe(
  spam ~ .,          # formula
  data = train_data  # data to use for cataloguing names and types of variables
  )

summary(email_rec)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(email_rec) %>% print(n = 21)
```

---

## Remove certain variables

```{r}
email_rec = email_rec %>%
  step_rm(from, sent_email)
```

.code70[
```{r echo=FALSE}
email_rec
```
]

---

## Feature engineer date

```{r}
email_rec = email_rec %>%
  step_date(time, features = c("dow", "month")) %>%
  step_rm(time)
```

.code70[

email_rec

## Discretize numeric variables

```{r}
email_rec = email_rec %>%
  step_cut(cc, attach, dollar, breaks = c(0, 1)) %>%

```

.code70[
```{r echo=FALSE}
email_rec

## Create dummy variables

```{r}
email_rec = email_rec %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes())
```

.code70[
```{r echo=FALSE}
email_rec
```
]

---

## Remove zero variance variables

Variables that contain only a single value

```{r}
email_rec = email_rec %>%
  step_zv(all_predictors())
#zv is short for "zero variability"
```

.code70[
```{r echo=FALSE}
email_rec
```
]

---

## All in one place

```{r}
email_rec = recipe(spam ~ ., data = email) %>%

## Evaluating performance on training data

-  The training set does not have the capacity to be a good arbiter of performance.

--
- It is not an independent piece of information; predicting the training set can only reflect what the model already knows.

--
- Suppose you give a class a test, then give them the answers, then provide the same test. The student scores on the second test do not accurately reflect what they know about the subject; these scores would probably be higher than their results on the first test.

### Training data optimism

In the typical case, we use cross-validation to tune and select between models, then use the train/test split to evaluate the final chosen model

-  In this case, the training data does not severely overestimate the performance in testing or cross-validation.
-  In general, the gap between training and test is a function of the training *optimism*.
-  $\nearrow$ model flexibility, $\nearrow$ optimism
-  $\searrow$ training set size, $\nearrow$ optimism.

# Final announcements

*  Final exam posted tomorrow (around noon) and due by 5pm 11/7, Thursday
*  You will have access to the lectures as long as github exists and provides hosting for websites.  
*  You will have access to your completed homework assignments on github as long as you have access to your github account.
*  I would rather that you not electronically redistribute the entirety of a graded assignment with another student<sup>1</sup> 

.footnote[[1] Reminder: sharing graded assignments within a class year isn't technically prohibited, but sharing across class years is prohibited and is a violation of the academic honesty policy per department policy.]
