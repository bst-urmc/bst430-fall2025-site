"78",158,"","Emma"
"79",158,"","Emma"
"80",158,"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and","Emma"
"81",158,"happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of","Emma"
"82",158,"existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very","Emma"
"83",158,"little to distress or vex her.","Emma"
"84",158,"","Emma"
"85",158,"She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,","Emma"
"86",158,"indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister’s marriage,","Emma"
"87",158,"been mistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother had","Emma"
"88",158,"died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance","Emma"
"89",158,"of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman","Emma"
"90",158,"as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.","Emma"
"91",158,"","Emma"
"92",158,"Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse’s family, less as a","Emma"
"93",158,"governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly","Emma"
"94",158,"of Emma. Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even","Emma"
"95",158,"before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess,","Emma"
"96",158,"the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any","Emma"
"97",158,"restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they","Emma"
"98",158,"had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached,","Emma"
"99",158,"and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor’s","Emma"
"100",158,"judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.","Emma"
"101",158,"","Emma"
"102",158,"The real evils, indeed, of Emma’s situation were the power of having","Emma"
"103",158,"rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too","Emma"
"104",158,"well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to","Emma"
"105",158,"her many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so","Emma"
"106",158,"unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with","Emma"
"107",158,"her.","Emma"
"108",158,"","Emma"
"109",158,"Sorrow came—a gentle sorrow—but not at all in the shape of any","Emma"
"110",158,"disagreeable consciousness.—Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor’s","Emma"
"111",158,"loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this","Emma"
"112",158,"beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any","Emma"
"113",158,"continuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father","Emma"
"114",158,"and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to","Emma"
"115",158,"cheer a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after","Emma"
"116",158,"dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she","Emma"
"117",158,"had lost.","Emma"
"118",158,"","Emma"
"119",158,"The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was","Emma"
"120",158,"a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and","Emma"
"121",158,"pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with","Emma"
"122",158,"what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and","Emma"
"123",158,"promoted the match; but it was a black morning’s work for her. The want","Emma"
"124",158,"of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her","Emma"
"125",158,"past kindness—the kindness, the affection of sixteen years—how she had","Emma"
"126",158,"taught and how she had played with her from five years old—how she had","Emma"
"127",158,"devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health—and how nursed","Emma"
"128",158,"her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of","Emma"
"129",158,"gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years,","Emma"
"130",158,"the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed","Emma"
"131",158,"Isabella’s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a","Emma"
"132",158,"dearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such","Emma"
"133",158,"as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing","Emma"
"134",158,"all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and","Emma"
"135",158,"peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of","Emma"
"136",158,"hers—one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had","Emma"
"137",158,"such an affection for her as could never find fault.","Emma"
"138",158,"","Emma"
"139",158,"How was she to bear the change?—It was true that her friend was going","Emma"
"140",158,"only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the","Emma"
"141",158,"difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a","Emma"
"142",158,"Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and","Emma"
"143",158,"domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual","Emma"
"144",158,"solitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.","Emma"
"145",158,"He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.","Emma"
"146",158,"","Emma"
"147",158,"The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had","Emma"
"148",158,"not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;","Emma"
"149",158,"for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind","Emma"
"150",158,"or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though","Emma"
"151",158,"everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable","Emma"
"152",158,"temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.","Emma"
"153",158,"","Emma"
"154",158,"Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being","Emma"
"155",158,"settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily","Emma"
"156",158,"reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled","Emma"
"157",158,"through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from","Emma"
"158",158,"Isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,","Emma"
"159",158,"and give her pleasant society again.","Emma"
"160",158,"","Emma"
"161",158,"Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,","Emma"
"162",158,"to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and","Emma"
"163",158,"name, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were","Emma"
"164",158,"first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many","Emma"
"165",158,"acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but","Emma"
"166",158,"not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for","Emma"
"167",158,"even half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but","Emma"
"168",158,"sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke,","Emma"
"169",158,"and made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He","Emma"
"170",158,"was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was","Emma"
"171",158,"used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.","Emma"
"172",158,"Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was","Emma"
"173",158,"by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter’s marrying, nor could","Emma"
"174",158,"ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a","Emma"
"175",158,"match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor","Emma"
"176",158,"too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able","Emma"
"177",158,"to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he","Emma"
"178",158,"was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for","Emma"
"179",158,"herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she","Emma"
"180",158,"had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and","Emma"
"181",158,"chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but","Emma"
"182",158,"when tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had","Emma"
"183",158,"said at dinner,","Emma"
"184",158,"","Emma"
"185",158,"“Poor Miss Taylor!—I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that","Emma"
"186",158,"Mr. Weston ever thought of her!”","Emma"
"187",158,"","Emma"
"188",158,"“I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a","Emma"
"189",158,"good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a","Emma"
"190",158,"good wife;—and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for","Emma"
"191",158,"ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her","Emma"
"192",158,"own?”","Emma"
"193",158,"","Emma"
"194",158,"“A house of her own!—But where is the advantage of a house of her own?","Emma"
"195",158,"This is three times as large.—And you have never any odd humours, my","Emma"
"196",158,"dear.”","Emma"
"197",158,"","Emma"
"198",158,"“How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!—We","Emma"
"199",158,"shall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding","Emma"
"200",158,"visit very soon.”","Emma"
"201",158,"","Emma"
"202",158,"“My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could","Emma"
"203",158,"not walk half so far.”","Emma"
"204",158,"","Emma"
"205",158,"“No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,","Emma"
"206",158,"to be sure.”","Emma"
"207",158,"","Emma"
"208",158,"“The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a","Emma"
"209",158,"little way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our","Emma"
"210",158,"visit?”","Emma"
"211",158,"","Emma"
"212",158,"“They are to be put into Mr. Weston’s stable, papa. You know we have","Emma"
"213",158,"settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last","Emma"
"214",158,"night. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going","Emma"
"215",158,"to Randalls, because of his daughter’s being housemaid there. I only","Emma"
"216",158,"doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,","Emma"
"217",158,"papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you","Emma"
"218",158,"mentioned her—James is so obliged to you!”","Emma"
"219",158,"","Emma"
"220",158,"“I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not","Emma"
"221",158,"have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am","Emma"
"222",158,"sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken","Emma"
"223",158,"girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always","Emma"
"224",158,"curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you","Emma"
"225",158,"have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock","Emma"
"226",158,"of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an","Emma"
"227",158,"excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor","Emma"
"228",158,"to have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes","Emma"
"229",158,"over to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will","Emma"
"230",158,"be able to tell her how we all are.”","Emma"
"231",158,"","Emma"
"232",158,"Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and","Emma"
"233",158,"hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through","Emma"
"234",158,"the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The","Emma"
"235",158,"backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards","Emma"
"236",158,"walked in and made it unnecessary.","Emma"
"237",158,"","Emma"
"238",158,"Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not","Emma"
"239",158,"only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly","Emma"
"240",158,"connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella’s husband. He lived","Emma"
"241",158,"about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,","Emma"
"242",158,"and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their","Emma"
"243",158,"mutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after","Emma"
"244",158,"some days’ absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were","Emma"
"245",158,"well in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr.","Emma"
"246",158,"Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which","Emma"
"247",158,"always did him good; and his many inquiries after “poor Isabella” and","Emma"
"248",158,"her children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.","Emma"
"249",158,"Woodhouse gratefully observed, “It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,","Emma"
"250",158,"to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must","Emma"
"251",158,"have had a shocking walk.”","Emma"
"252",158,"","Emma"
"253",158,"“Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I","Emma"
"254",158,"must draw back from your great fire.”","Emma"
"255",158,"","Emma"
"256",158,"“But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not","Emma"
"257",158,"catch cold.”","Emma"
"258",158,"","Emma"
"259",158,"“Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.”","Emma"
"260",158,"","Emma"
"261",158,"“Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain","Emma"
"262",158,"here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at","Emma"
"263",158,"breakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.”","Emma"
"264",158,"","Emma"
"265",158,"“By the bye—I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what","Emma"
"266",158,"sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my","Emma"
"267",158,"congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you","Emma"
"268",158,"all behave? Who cried most?”","Emma"
"269",158,"","Emma"
"270",158,"“Ah! poor Miss Taylor! ’Tis a sad business.”","Emma"
"271",158,"","Emma"
"272",158,"“Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say","Emma"
"273",158,"‘poor Miss Taylor.’ I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it","Emma"
"274",158,"comes to the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate, it","Emma"
"275",158,"must be better to have only one to please than two.”","Emma"
"276",158,"","Emma"
"277",158,"“Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome","Emma"
"278",158,"creature!” said Emma playfully. “That is what you have in your head, I","Emma"
"279",158,"know—and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.”","Emma"
"280",158,"","Emma"
"281",158,"“I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,” said Mr. Woodhouse, with","Emma"
"282",158,"a sigh. “I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.”","Emma"
"283",158,"","Emma"
"284",158,"“My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.","Emma"
"285",158,"Knightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only","Emma"
"286",158,"myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know—in a","Emma"
"287",158,"joke—it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.”","Emma"
"288",158,"","Emma"
"289",158,"Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults","Emma"
"290",158,"in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and","Emma"
"291",158,"though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it","Emma"
"292",158,"would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him","Emma"
"293",158,"really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by","Emma"
"294",158,"every body.","Emma"
"295",158,"","Emma"
"296",158,"“Emma knows I never flatter her,” said Mr. Knightley, “but I meant no","Emma"
"297",158,"reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons","Emma"
"298",158,"to please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be","Emma"
"299",158,"a gainer.”","Emma"
"300",158,"","Emma"
"301",158,"“Well,” said Emma, willing to let it pass—“you want to hear about the","Emma"
"302",158,"wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved","Emma"
"303",158,"charmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks:","Emma"
"304",158,"not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that","Emma"
"305",158,"we were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting","Emma"
"306",158,"every day.”","Emma"
"307",158,"","Emma"
"308",158,"“Dear Emma bears every thing so well,” said her father. “But, Mr.","Emma"
"309",158,"Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am","Emma"
"310",158,"sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.”","Emma"
"311",158,"","Emma"
"312",158,"Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. “It is","Emma"
"313",158,"impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,” said Mr.","Emma"
"314",158,"Knightley. “We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could","Emma"
"315",158,"suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor’s","Emma"
"316",158,"advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor’s","Emma"
"317",158,"time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to","Emma"
"318",158,"her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow","Emma"
"319",158,"herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor","Emma"
"320",158,"must be glad to have her so happily married.”","Emma"
"321",158,"","Emma"
"322",158,"“And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,” said Emma, “and a","Emma"
"323",158,"very considerable one—that I made the match myself. I made the match,","Emma"
"324",158,"you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in","Emma"
"325",158,"the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again,","Emma"
"326",158,"may comfort me for any thing.”","Emma"
"327",158,"","Emma"
"328",158,"Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, “Ah! my","Emma"
"329",158,"dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for","Emma"
"330",158,"whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more","Emma"
"331",158,"matches.”","Emma"
"332",158,"","Emma"
"333",158,"“I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for","Emma"
"334",158,"other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such","Emma"
"335",158,"success, you know!—Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry","Emma"
"336",158,"again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who","Emma"
"337",158,"seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied","Emma"
"338",158,"either in his business in town or among his friends here, always","Emma"
"339",158,"acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful—Mr. Weston need not spend","Emma"
"340",158,"a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.","Emma"
"341",158,"Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a","Emma"
"342",158,"promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the","Emma"
"343",158,"uncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the","Emma"
"344",158,"subject, but I believed none of it.","Emma"
"345",158,"","Emma"
"346",158,"“Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I met","Emma"
"347",158,"with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted","Emma"
"348",158,"away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from","Emma"
"349",158,"Farmer Mitchell’s, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the","Emma"
"350",158,"match from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this","Emma"
"351",158,"instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off","Emma"
"352",158,"match-making.”","Emma"
"353",158,"","Emma"
"354",158,"“I do not understand what you mean by ‘success,’” said Mr. Knightley.","Emma"
"355",158,"“Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately","Emma"
"356",158,"spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring","Emma"
"357",158,"about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady’s mind! But","Emma"
"358",158,"if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it,","Emma"
"359",158,"means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, ‘I","Emma"
"360",158,"think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were","Emma"
"361",158,"to marry her,’ and saying it again to yourself every now and then","Emma"
"362",158,"afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are","Emma"
"363",158,"you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be","Emma"
"364",158,"said.”","Emma"
"365",158,"","Emma"
"366",158,"“And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?—I","Emma"
"367",158,"pity you.—I thought you cleverer—for, depend upon it a lucky guess is","Emma"
"368",158,"never merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor","Emma"
"369",158,"word ‘success,’ which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so","Emma"
"370",158,"entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;","Emma"
"371",158,"but I think there may be a third—a something between the do-nothing and","Emma"
"372",158,"the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston’s visits here, and given","Emma"
"373",158,"many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might","Emma"
"374",158,"not have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield","Emma"
"375",158,"enough to comprehend that.”","Emma"
"376",158,"","Emma"
"377",158,"“A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,","Emma"
"378",158,"unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their","Emma"
"379",158,"own concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than","Emma"
"380",158,"good to them, by interference.”","Emma"
"381",158,"","Emma"
"382",158,"“Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,” rejoined","Emma"
"383",158,"Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. “But, my dear, pray do not","Emma"

"390",158,"fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have","Emma"
"391",158,"him single any longer—and I thought when he was joining their hands","Emma"
"392",158,"to-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same","Emma"

"411",158,"CHAPTER II","Emma"
"412",158,"","Emma"
"413",158,"","Emma"
"414",158,"Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,","Emma"
"415",158,"which for the last two or three generations had been rising into","Emma"
"416",158,"gentility and property. He had received a good education, but, on","Emma"
"417",158,"succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed","Emma"
"418",158,"for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,","Emma"
"419",158,"and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by","Emma"
"420",158,"entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.","Emma"
"421",158,"","Emma"
"422",158,"Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his","Emma"
"423",158,"military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great","Emma"
"424",158,"Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was","Emma"
"425",158,"surprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and","Emma"
"426",158,"who were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would","Emma"
"427",158,"offend.","Emma"
"428",158,"","Emma"
"429",158,"Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her","Emma"
"430",158,"fortune—though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate—was","Emma"
"431",158,"not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the","Emma"
"432",158,"infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off","Emma"
"433",158,"with due decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce","Emma"
"434",158,"much happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had","Emma"
"435",158,"a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing","Emma"
"436",158,"due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him;","Emma"
"437",158,"but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She had","Emma"
"438",158,"resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but","Emma"
"439",158,"not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother’s","Emma"
"440",158,"unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.","Emma"
"441",158,"They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison","Emma"
"442",158,"of Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at","Emma"
"443",158,"once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.","Emma"
"444",158,"","Emma"
"445",158,"Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,","Emma"
"446",158,"as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of","Emma"
"447",158,"the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years’ marriage, he","Emma"
"448",158,"was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.","Emma"
"449",158,"From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. The boy","Emma"
"450",158,"had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his","Emma"
"451",158,"mother’s, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.","Emma"
"452",158,"Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young","Emma"
"453",158,"creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge","Emma"
"454",158,"of the little Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples and some","Emma"
"455",158,"reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they","Emma"
"456",158,"were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the","Emma"
"457",158,"care and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort","Emma"
"458",158,"to seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.","Emma"
"459",158,"","Emma"
"460",158,"A complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and","Emma"
"461",158,"engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in","Emma"
"462",158,"London, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which","Emma"
"463",158,"brought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,","Emma"
"464",158,"where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful","Emma"
"465",158,"occupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty","Emma"
"466",158,"years of his life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time,","Emma"
"467",158,"realised an easy competence—enough to secure the purchase of a little","Emma"
"468",158,"estate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for—enough to","Emma"
"469",158,"marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according","Emma"
"470",158,"to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.","Emma"
"471",158,"","Emma"
"472",158,"It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his","Emma"
"473",158,"schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it","Emma"
"474",158,"had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could","Emma"
"475",158,"purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;","Emma"
"476",158,"but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were","Emma"
"477",158,"accomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained","Emma"
"478",158,"his wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every","Emma"
"479",158,"probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He had","Emma"
"480",158,"never been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,","Emma"
"481",158,"even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful","Emma"
"482",158,"a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the","Emma"
"483",158,"pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be","Emma"
"484",158,"chosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.","Emma"
"485",158,"","Emma"
"486",158,"He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own;","Emma"
"487",158,"for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his","Emma"
"488",158,"uncle’s heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume","Emma"
"489",158,"the name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely,","Emma"
"490",158,"therefore, that he should ever want his father’s assistance. His father","Emma"
"491",158,"had no apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and","Emma"
"492",158,"governed her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston’s nature to","Emma"
"493",158,"imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear,","Emma"
"494",158,"and, as he believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in","Emma"
"495",158,"London, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine","Emma"
"496",158,"young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was","Emma"
"497",158,"looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and","Emma"
"498",158,"prospects a kind of common concern.","Emma"
"499",158,"","Emma"
"500",158,"Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively","Emma"
"501",158,"curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little","Emma"
"502",158,"returned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visit","Emma"
"503",158,"his father had been often talked of but never achieved.","Emma"
"504",158,"","Emma"
"505",158,"Now, upon his father’s marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a","Emma"
"506",158,"most proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not","Emma"
"507",158,"a dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea","Emma"
"508",158,"with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the","Emma"
"509",158,"visit. Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and","Emma"
"510",158,"the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his","Emma"
"511",158,"new mother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in","Emma"
"512",158,"Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had","Emma"
"513",158,"received. “I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank","Emma"
"514",158,"Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very","Emma"
"515",158,"handsome letter, indeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw","Emma"
"516",158,"the letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his","Emma"
"517",158,"life.”","Emma"
"518",158,"","Emma"
"519",158,"It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course,","Emma"
"520",158,"formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing","Emma"
"521",158,"attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most","Emma"
"522",158,"welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation","Emma"
"523",158,"which her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a most","Emma"
"524",158,"fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate","Emma"
"525",158,"she might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial","Emma"
"526",158,"separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and","Emma"
"527",158,"who could ill bear to part with her.","Emma"
"528",158,"","Emma"
"529",158,"She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without","Emma"
"530",158,"pain, of Emma’s losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour’s ennui,","Emma"
"531",158,"from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble","Emma"
"532",158,"character; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would","Emma"
"533",158,"have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped","Emma"
"534",158,"would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and","Emma"
"535",158,"privations. And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance","Emma"
"536",158,"of Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female","Emma"
"537",158,"walking, and in Mr. Weston’s disposition and circumstances, which would","Emma"
"538",158,"make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the","Emma"
"539",158,"evenings in the week together.","Emma"
"540",158,"","Emma"
"541",158,"Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.","Emma"
"542",158,"Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction—her more","Emma"
"543",158,"than satisfaction—her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,","Emma"
"544",158,"that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize","Emma"
"545",158,"at his being still able to pity ‘poor Miss Taylor,’ when they left her","Emma"
"546",158,"at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away","Emma"
"547",158,"in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her","Emma"
"548",158,"own. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse’s giving a gentle sigh,","Emma"
"549",158,"and saying, “Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.”","Emma"
"550",158,"","Emma"
"551",158,"There was no recovering Miss Taylor—nor much likelihood of ceasing to","Emma"
"552",158,"pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.","Emma"
"553",158,"The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by","Emma"
"554",158,"being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which","Emma"
"555",158,"had been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach could","Emma"
"556",158,"bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be","Emma"
"557",158,"different from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as","Emma"
"558",158,"unfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade","Emma"
"559",158,"them from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as","Emma"
"560",158,"earnestly tried to prevent any body’s eating it. He had been at the","Emma"
"561",158,"pains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr.","Emma"
"562",158,"Perry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were","Emma"
"563",158,"one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse’s life; and upon being applied to,","Emma"
"564",158,"he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias","Emma"
"565",158,"of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with","Emma"
"566",158,"many—perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an","Emma"
"567",158,"opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence","Emma"
"568",158,"every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;","Emma"
"569",158,"and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.","Emma"
"570",158,"","Emma"
"571",158,"There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being","Emma"
"572",158,"seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston’s wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.","Emma"
"573",158,"Woodhouse would never believe it.","Emma"
"574",158,"","Emma"
"575",158,"","Emma"
"576",158,"","Emma"
"577",158,"","Emma"
"578",158,"CHAPTER III","Emma"
"579",158,"","Emma"
"580",158,"","Emma"
"581",158,"Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much to","Emma"
"582",158,"have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from","Emma"
"583",158,"his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune,","Emma"
"584",158,"his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own","Emma"
"585",158,"little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not much","Emma"
"586",158,"intercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late","Emma"
"587",158,"hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance","Emma"
"588",158,"but such as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him,","Emma"
"589",158,"Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in","Emma"
"590",158,"the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many","Emma"
"591",158,"such. Not unfrequently, through Emma’s persuasion, he had some of the","Emma"
"592",158,"chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he","Emma"
"593",158,"preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to","Emma"
"594",158,"company, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could","Emma"
"595",158,"not make up a card-table for him.","Emma"
"596",158,"","Emma"
"597",158,"Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and","Emma"
"598",158,"by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege","Emma"
"599",158,"of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the","Emma"
"600",158,"elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse’s drawing-room, and the smiles","Emma"
"601",158,"of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.","Emma"
"602",158,"","Emma"
"603",158,"After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were","Emma"
"604",158,"Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at","Emma"
"605",158,"the service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and","Emma"
"606",158,"carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for","Emma"
"607",158,"either James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it","Emma"
"608",158,"would have been a grievance.","Emma"
"609",158,"","Emma"
"610",158,"Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old","Emma"
"611",158,"lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her","Emma"
"612",158,"single daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the","Emma"
"613",158,"regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward","Emma"
"614",158,"circumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree","Emma"
"615",158,"of popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.","Emma"
"616",158,"Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having","Emma"
"617",158,"much of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to","Emma"
"618",158,"make atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into","Emma"
"619",158,"outward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her","Emma"
"620",158,"youth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was","Emma"
"621",158,"devoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a","Emma"
"622",158,"small income go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and","Emma"
"623",158,"a woman whom no one named without good-will. It was her own universal","Emma"
"624",158,"good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved","Emma"
"625",158,"every body, was interested in every body’s happiness, quicksighted to","Emma"
"626",158,"every body’s merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and","Emma"
"627",158,"surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good","Emma"
"628",158,"neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The","Emma"
"629",158,"simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful","Emma"
"630",158,"spirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to","Emma"
"631",158,"herself. She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly","Emma"
"632",158,"suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless","Emma"
"633",158,"gossip.","Emma"
"634",158,"","Emma"
"635",158,"Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School—not of a seminary, or an","Emma"
"636",158,"establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of","Emma"
"637",158,"refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant","Emma"
"638",158,"morality, upon new principles and new systems—and where young ladies","Emma"
"639",158,"for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity—but a","Emma"
"640",158,"real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable","Emma"
"641",158,"quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where","Emma"
"642",158,"girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into","Emma"
"643",158,"a little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs.","Emma"
"644",158,"Goddard’s school was in high repute—and very deservedly; for Highbury","Emma"
"645",158,"was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and","Emma"
"646",158,"garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about","Emma"
"647",158,"a great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with","Emma"
"648",158,"her own hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now","Emma"
"649",158,"walked after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,","Emma"
"650",158,"who had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to","Emma"
"651",158,"the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to","Emma"
"652",158,"Mr. Woodhouse’s kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her","Emma"
"653",158,"neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win","Emma"
"654",158,"or lose a few sixpences by his fireside.","Emma"
"655",158,"","Emma"
"656",158,"These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to","Emma"
"657",158,"collect; and happy was she, for her father’s sake, in the power;","Emma"
"658",158,"though, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the","Emma"
"659",158,"absence of Mrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father look","Emma"
"660",158,"comfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving things","Emma"
"661",158,"so well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that","Emma"
"662",158,"every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had","Emma"
"663",158,"fearfully anticipated.","Emma"
"664",158,"","Emma"
"665",158,"As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the","Emma"
"666",158,"present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most","Emma"
"667",158,"respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most","Emma"
"668",158,"welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew","Emma"
"669",158,"very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of her","Emma"
"670",158,"beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no","Emma"
"671",158,"longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.","Emma"
"672",158,"","Emma"
"673",158,"Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed","Emma"
"674",158,"her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard’s school, and somebody had","Emma"
"675",158,"lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of","Emma"
"676",158,"parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her history.","Emma"
"677",158,"She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and","Emma"
"678",158,"was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young","Emma"
"679",158,"ladies who had been at school there with her.","Emma"
"680",158,"","Emma"
"681",158,"She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort","Emma"
"682",158,"which Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a","Emma"
"683",158,"fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of","Emma"
"684",158,"great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much","Emma"
"685",158,"pleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined to","Emma"
"686",158,"continue the acquaintance.","Emma"
"687",158,"","Emma"
"688",158,"She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith’s","Emma"
"689",158,"conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging—not","Emma"
"690",158,"inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk—and yet so far from pushing,","Emma"
"691",158,"shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly","Emma"
"692",158,"grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by","Emma"
"693",158,"the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had","Emma"
"694",158,"been used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.","Emma"
"695",158,"Encouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those","Emma"
"696",158,"natural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of","Emma"
"697",158,"Highbury and its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed","Emma"
"698",158,"were unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though","Emma"
"699",158,"very good sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of","Emma"
"700",158,"the name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a","Emma"
"701",158,"large farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell—very","Emma"
"702",158,"creditably, she believed—she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of","Emma"
"703",158,"them—but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the","Emma"
"704",158,"intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and","Emma"
"705",158,"elegance to be quite perfect. _She_ would notice her; she would improve","Emma"
"706",158,"her; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her","Emma"
"707",158,"into good society; she would form her opinions and her manners. It","Emma"
"708",158,"would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly","Emma"
"709",158,"becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.","Emma"
"710",158,"","Emma"
"711",158,"She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and","Emma"
"712",158,"listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the","Emma"
"713",158,"evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which","Emma"
"714",158,"always closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and","Emma"
"715",158,"watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to","Emma"
"716",158,"the fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common","Emma"
"717",158,"impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of","Emma"
"718",158,"doing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a","Emma"
"719",158,"mind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of","Emma"
"720",158,"the meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped","Emma"
"721",158,"oysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the","Emma"
"722",158,"early hours and civil scruples of their guests.","Emma"
"723",158,"","Emma"
"724",158,"Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse’s feelings were in sad warfare.","Emma"
"725",158,"He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his","Emma"
"726",158,"youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him","Emma"
"727",158,"rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality","Emma"
"728",158,"would have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their","Emma"
"729",158,"health made him grieve that they would eat.","Emma"
"730",158,"","Emma"
"731",158,"Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he","Emma"
"732",158,"could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might","Emma"
"733",158,"constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer","Emma"
"734",158,"things, to say:","Emma"
"735",158,"","Emma"
"736",158,"“Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg","Emma"
"737",158,"boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg","Emma"
"738",158,"better than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body","Emma"
"739",158,"else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see—one of","Emma"
"740",158,"our small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a","Emma"
"741",158,"_little_ bit of tart—a _very_ little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You","Emma"
"742",158,"need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the","Emma"
"743",158,"custard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to _half_ a glass of wine? A","Emma"
"744",158,"_small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it","Emma"
"745",158,"could disagree with you.”","Emma"
"746",158,"","Emma"
"747",158,"Emma allowed her father to talk—but supplied her visitors in a much","Emma"
"748",158,"more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular","Emma"
"749",158,"pleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was","Emma"
"750",158,"quite equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage","Emma"
"751",158,"in Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much","Emma"
"752",158,"panic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with","Emma"
"753",158,"highly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which","Emma"
"754",158,"Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken","Emma"
"755",158,"hands with her at last!","Emma"

"760",158,"CHAPTER IV","Emma"
"761",158,"","Emma"
"762",158,"","Emma"
"763",158,"Harriet Smith’s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick","Emma"
"764",158,"and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,","Emma"
"765",158,"and telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance","Emma"
"766",158,"increased, so did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking","Emma"
"767",158,"companion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.","Emma"
"768",158,"In that respect Mrs. Weston’s loss had been important. Her father never","Emma"
"769",158,"went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed","Emma"
"770",158,"him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs.","Emma"
"771",158,"Weston’s marriage her exercise had been too much confined. She had","Emma"
"772",158,"ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet","Emma"
"773",158,"Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time to a walk,","Emma"
"774",158,"would be a valuable addition to her privileges. But in every respect,","Emma"
"775",158,"as she saw more of her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her","Emma"
"776",158,"kind designs.","Emma"
"777",158,"","Emma"
"778",158,"Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful","Emma"
"779",158,"disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be","Emma"
"780",158,"guided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself was","Emma"
"781",158,"very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of","Emma"
"782",158,"appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want","Emma"
"783",158,"of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.","Emma"
"784",158,"Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith’s being exactly the","Emma"
"785",158,"young friend she wanted—exactly the something which her home required.","Emma"
"786",158,"Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could","Emma"
"787",158,"never be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different","Emma"
"788",158,"sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was","Emma"
"789",158,"the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.","Emma"
"790",158,"Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs.","Emma"
"791",158,"Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.","Emma"
"792",158,"","Emma"
"793",158,"Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who","Emma"
"794",158,"were the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell","Emma"
"795",158,"every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma","Emma"
"796",158,"was obliged to fancy what she liked—but she could never believe that in","Emma"
"797",158,"the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth. Harriet","Emma"
"798",158,"had no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just","Emma"
"799",158,"what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.","Emma"
"800",158,"","Emma"
"801",158,"Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the","Emma"
"802",158,"school in general, formed naturally a great part of the","Emma"
"803",158,"conversation—and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of","Emma"
"804",158,"Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied","Emma"
"805",158,"her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with","Emma"
"806",158,"them, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe","Emma"
"807",158,"the many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her","Emma"
"808",158,"talkativeness—amused by such a picture of another set of beings, and","Emma"
"809",158,"enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much","Emma"
"810",158,"exultation of Mrs. Martin’s having “_two_ parlours, two very good","Emma"
"811",158,"parlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard’s","Emma"
"812",158,"drawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived","Emma"
"813",158,"five-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of","Emma"
"814",158,"them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch","Emma"
"815",158,"cow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin’s saying as she was so fond of it, it","Emma"
"816",158,"should be called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome","Emma"
"817",158,"summer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to","Emma"
"818",158,"drink tea:—a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen","Emma"
"819",158,"people.”","Emma"
"820",158,"","Emma"
"821",158,"For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate","Emma"
"822",158,"cause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings","Emma"
"823",158,"arose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and","Emma"
"824",158,"daughter, a son and son’s wife, who all lived together; but when it","Emma"
"825",158,"appeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was","Emma"
"826",158,"always mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing","Emma"
"827",158,"something or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.","Emma"
"828",158,"Martin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little","Emma"
"829",158,"friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were","Emma"
"830",158,"not taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.","Emma"
"831",158,"","Emma"
"832",158,"With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and","Emma"
"833",158,"meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,","Emma"
"834",158,"and there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to","Emma"
"835",158,"speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry","Emma"
"836",158,"evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very","Emma"
"837",158,"good-humoured and obliging. He had gone three miles round one day in","Emma"
"838",158,"order to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was","Emma"
"839",158,"of them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging. He had his","Emma"
"840",158,"shepherd’s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.","Emma"
"841",158,"She was very fond of singing. He could sing a little himself. She","Emma"
"842",158,"believed he was very clever, and understood every thing. He had a very","Emma"
"843",158,"fine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been bid more for his","Emma"
"844",158,"wool than any body in the country. She believed every body spoke well","Emma"
"845",158,"of him. His mother and sisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had","Emma"
"846",158,"told her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that it was","Emma"
"847",158,"impossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was sure,","Emma"
"848",158,"whenever he married, he would make a good husband. Not that she","Emma"
"849",158,"_wanted_ him to marry. She was in no hurry at all.","Emma"
"850",158,"","Emma"
"851",158,"“Well done, Mrs. Martin!” thought Emma. “You know what you are about.”","Emma"
"852",158,"","Emma"
"853",158,"“And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send","Emma"
"854",158,"Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose—the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever","Emma"
"855",158,"seen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three","Emma"
"856",158,"teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with","Emma"
"857",158,"her.”","Emma"
"858",158,"","Emma"
"859",158,"“Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of","Emma"
"860",158,"his own business? He does not read?”","Emma"
"861",158,"","Emma"
"862",158,"“Oh yes!—that is, no—I do not know—but I believe he has read a good","Emma"
"863",158,"deal—but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the","Emma"
"864",158,"Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the","Emma"
"865",158,"window seats—but he reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an","Emma"
"866",158,"evening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of","Emma"
"867",158,"the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the","Emma"
"868",158,"Vicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The","Emma"
"869",158,"Children of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I","Emma"
"870",158,"mentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he","Emma"
"871",158,"can.”","Emma"
"872",158,"","Emma"
"873",158,"The next question was—","Emma"
"874",158,"","Emma"
"875",158,"“What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?”","Emma"
"876",158,"","Emma"
"877",158,"“Oh! not handsome—not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at","Emma"
"878",158,"first, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,","Emma"
"879",158,"after a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now","Emma"
"880",158,"and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to","Emma"
"881",158,"Kingston. He has passed you very often.”","Emma"
"882",158,"","Emma"
"883",158,"“That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having","Emma"
"884",158,"any idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,","Emma"
"885",158,"is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are","Emma"
"886",158,"precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to","Emma"
"887",158,"do. A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest","Emma"
"888",158,"me; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other.","Emma"
"889",158,"But a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense,","Emma"
"890",158,"as much above my notice as in every other he is below it.”","Emma"
"891",158,"","Emma"
"892",158,"“To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed","Emma"
"893",158,"him; but he knows you very well indeed—I mean by sight.”","Emma"
"894",158,"","Emma"
"895",158,"“I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,","Emma"
"896",158,"indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine","Emma"
"897",158,"his age to be?”","Emma"
"898",158,"","Emma"
"899",158,"“He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the","Emma"
"900",158,"23rd just a fortnight and a day’s difference—which is very odd.”","Emma"
"901",158,"","Emma"
"902",158,"“Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is","Emma"
"903",158,"perfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as","Emma"
"904",158,"they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would","Emma"
"905",158,"probably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort","Emma"
"906",158,"of young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it","Emma"
"907",158,"might be very desirable.”","Emma"
"908",158,"","Emma"
"909",158,"“Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!”","Emma"
"910",158,"","Emma"
"911",158,"“Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are","Emma"
"912",158,"not born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune","Emma"
"913",158,"entirely to make—cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever","Emma"
"914",158,"money he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of","Emma"
"915",158,"the family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his","Emma"
"916",158,"stock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may","Emma"
"917",158,"be rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised","Emma"
"918",158,"any thing yet.”","Emma"
"919",158,"","Emma"
"920",158,"“To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no","Emma"
"921",158,"indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks","Emma"
"922",158,"of taking a boy another year.”","Emma"
"923",158,"","Emma"
"924",158,"“I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does","Emma"
"925",158,"marry;—I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife—for though his","Emma"
"926",158,"sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected","Emma"
"927",158,"to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you","Emma"
"928",158,"to notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly","Emma"
"929",158,"careful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a","Emma"
"930",158,"gentleman’s daughter, and you must support your claim to that station","Emma"
"931",158,"by every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people","Emma"
"932",158,"who would take pleasure in degrading you.”","Emma"
"933",158,"","Emma"
"934",158,"“Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield,","Emma"
"935",158,"and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any","Emma"
"936",158,"body can do.”","Emma"
"937",158,"","Emma"
"938",158,"“You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I","Emma"
"939",158,"would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be","Emma"
"940",158,"independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you","Emma"
"941",158,"permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to","Emma"
"942",158,"have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if","Emma"
"943",158,"you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you","Emma"
"944",158,"may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted","Emma"
"945",158,"with the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer’s daughter,","Emma"
"946",158,"without education.”","Emma"
"947",158,"","Emma"
"948",158,"“To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body","Emma"
"949",158,"but what had had some education—and been very well brought up. However,","Emma"
"950",158,"I do not mean to set up my opinion against yours—and I am sure I shall","Emma"
"951",158,"not wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always have a great","Emma"
"952",158,"regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very","Emma"
"953",158,"sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me. But","Emma"
"954",158,"if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not","Emma"
"955",158,"visit her, if I can help it.”","Emma"
"956",158,"","Emma"
"957",158,"Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no","Emma"
"958",158,"alarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer,","Emma"
"959",158,"but she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no","Emma"
"960",158,"serious difficulty, on Harriet’s side, to oppose any friendly","Emma"
"961",158,"arrangement of her own.","Emma"
"962",158,"","Emma"
"963",158,"They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the","Emma"
"964",158,"Donwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at","Emma"
"965",158,"her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was","Emma"
"966",158,"not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few","Emma"
"967",158,"yards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye","Emma"
"968",158,"sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very","Emma"
"969",158,"neat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no","Emma"
"970",158,"other advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she","Emma"
"971",158,"thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet’s","Emma"
"972",158,"inclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily","Emma"
"973",158,"noticed her father’s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.","Emma"
"974",158,"Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was.","Emma"
"975",158,"","Emma"
"976",158,"They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be","Emma"
"977",158,"kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,","Emma"
"978",158,"and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to","Emma"
"979",158,"compose.","Emma"
"980",158,"","Emma"
"981",158,"“Only think of our happening to meet him!—How very odd! It was quite a","Emma"
"982",158,"chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not","Emma"
"983",158,"think we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls","Emma"
"984",158,"most days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.","Emma"
"985",158,"He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot","Emma"
"986",158,"it, but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet!","Emma"
"987",158,"Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think","Emma"
"988",158,"of him? Do you think him so very plain?”","Emma"
"989",158,"","Emma"
"990",158,"“He is very plain, undoubtedly—remarkably plain:—but that is nothing","Emma"
"991",158,"compared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect","Emma"
"992",158,"much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so","Emma"
"993",158,"very clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a","Emma"
"994",158,"degree or two nearer gentility.”","Emma"
"995",158,"","Emma"
"996",158,"“To be sure,” said Harriet, in a mortified voice, “he is not so genteel","Emma"
"997",158,"as real gentlemen.”","Emma"
"998",158,"","Emma"
"999",158,"“I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been","Emma"
"1000",158,"repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you","Emma"
"1001",158,"must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At","Emma"
"1002",158,"Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred","Emma"
"1003",158,"men. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in","Emma"
"1004",158,"company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very","Emma"
"1005",158,"inferior creature—and rather wondering at yourself for having ever","Emma"
"1006",158,"thought him at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now?","Emma"
"1007",158,"Were not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward","Emma"
"1008",158,"look and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to","Emma"
"1009",158,"be wholly unmodulated as I stood here.”","Emma"
"1010",158,"","Emma"
"1011",158,"“Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air","Emma"
"1012",158,"and way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough.","Emma"
"1013",158,"But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!”","Emma"
"1014",158,"","Emma"
"1015",158,"“Mr. Knightley’s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to","Emma"
"1016",158,"compare Mr. Martin with _him_. You might not see one in a hundred with","Emma"
"1017",158,"_gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the","Emma"
"1018",158,"only gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston","Emma"
"1019",158,"and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_. Compare their","Emma"
"1020",158,"manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being","Emma"
"1021",158,"silent. You must see the difference.”","Emma"
"1022",158,"","Emma"
"1023",158,"“Oh yes!—there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old","Emma"
"1024",158,"man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.”","Emma"
"1025",158,"","Emma"
"1026",158,"“Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person","Emma"
"1027",158,"grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not","Emma"
"1028",158,"be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or","Emma"
"1029",158,"awkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later","Emma"
"1030",158,"age. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.","Emma"
"1031",158,"Weston’s time of life?”","Emma"
"1032",158,"","Emma"
"1033",158,"“There is no saying, indeed,” replied Harriet rather solemnly.","Emma"
"1034",158,"","Emma"
"1035",158,"“But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross,","Emma"
"1036",158,"vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of","Emma"
"1037",158,"nothing but profit and loss.”","Emma"
"1038",158,"","Emma"
"1039",158,"“Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.”","Emma"
"1040",158,"","Emma"
"1041",158,"“How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the","Emma"
"1042",158,"circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.","Emma"
"1043",158,"He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing","Emma"
"1044",158,"else—which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to","Emma"
"1045",158,"do with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive, and be a very","Emma"
"1046",158,"rich man in time—and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb","Emma"
"1047",158,"_us_.”","Emma"
"1048",158,"","Emma"
"1049",158,"“I wonder he did not remember the book”—was all Harriet’s answer, and","Emma"
"1050",158,"spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be","Emma"
"1051",158,"safely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Her","Emma"
"1052",158,"next beginning was,","Emma"
"1053",158,"","Emma"
"1054",158,"“In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton’s manners are superior to Mr.","Emma"
"1055",158,"Knightley’s or Mr. Weston’s. They have more gentleness. They might be","Emma"
"1056",158,"more safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,","Emma"
"1057",158,"almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in _him_,","Emma"
"1058",158,"because there is so much good-humour with it—but that would not do to","Emma"
"1059",158,"be copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley’s downright, decided, commanding","Emma"
"1060",158,"sort of manner, though it suits _him_ very well; his figure, and look,","Emma"
"1061",158,"and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to","Emma"
"1062",158,"set about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I","Emma"
"1063",158,"think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as","Emma"
"1064",158,"a model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He","Emma"
"1065",158,"seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know","Emma"
"1066",158,"whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,","Emma"
"1067",158,"Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are","Emma"
"1068",158,"softer than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to","Emma"
"1069",158,"please you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?”","Emma"
"1070",158,"","Emma"
"1071",158,"She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from","Emma"
"1072",158,"Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled,","Emma"
"1073",158,"and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.","Emma"
"1074",158,"","Emma"
"1075",158,"Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young","Emma"
"1076",158,"farmer out of Harriet’s head. She thought it would be an excellent","Emma"
"1077",158,"match; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her","Emma"
"1078",158,"to have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every body","Emma"
"1079",158,"else must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any","Emma"
"1080",158,"body should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had","Emma"
"1081",158,"entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet’s coming to","Emma"
"1082",158,"Hartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense of","Emma"
"1083",158,"its expediency. Mr. Elton’s situation was most suitable, quite the","Emma"
"1084",158,"gentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of","Emma"
"1085",158,"any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.","Emma"
"1086",158,"He had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient","Emma"
"1087",158,"income; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known","Emma"
"1088",158,"to have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him","Emma"
"1089",158,"as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any","Emma"
"1090",158,"deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.","Emma"
"1091",158,"","Emma"
"1092",158,"She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful","Emma"
"1093",158,"girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was","Emma"
"1094",158,"foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet’s there could be little","Emma"
"1095",158,"doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual","Emma"
"1096",158,"weight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing young man, a","Emma"
"1097",158,"young man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned","Emma"
"1098",158,"very handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her,","Emma"
"1099",158,"there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense","Emma"
"1100",158,"with:—but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin’s riding","Emma"
"1101",158,"about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered","Emma"

"1110",158,"“I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,” said Mr.","Emma"
"1111",158,"Knightley, “of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but","Emma"
"1112",158,"I think it a bad thing.”","Emma"
"1113",158,"","Emma"
"1114",158,"“A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?—why so?”","Emma"
"1115",158,"","Emma"
"1116",158,"“I think they will neither of them do the other any good.”","Emma"
"1117",158,"","Emma"
"1118",158,"“You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her with","Emma"
"1119",158,"a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have","Emma"
"1120",158,"been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very","Emma"
"1121",158,"differently we feel!—Not think they will do each other any good! This","Emma"
"1122",158,"will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.","Emma"
"1123",158,"Knightley.”","Emma"
"1124",158,"","Emma"
"1125",158,"“Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing","Emma"
"1126",158,"Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.”","Emma"
"1127",158,"","Emma"
"1128",158,"“Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he","Emma"
"1129",158,"thinks exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only","Emma"
"1130",158,"yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there","Emma"
"1131",158,"should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr.","Emma"
"1132",158,"Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. You","Emma"
"1133",158,"are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of a","Emma"
"1134",158,"companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a","Emma"
"1135",158,"woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used to","Emma"
"1136",158,"it all her life. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. She is","Emma"
"1137",158,"not the superior young woman which Emma’s friend ought to be. But on","Emma"
"1138",158,"the other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed, it will be an","Emma"
"1139",158,"inducement to her to read more herself. They will read together. She","Emma"
"1140",158,"means it, I know.”","Emma"
"1141",158,"","Emma"
"1142",158,"“Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years","Emma"
"1143",158,"old. I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times","Emma"
"1144",158,"of books that she meant to read regularly through—and very good lists","Emma"
"1145",158,"they were—very well chosen, and very neatly arranged—sometimes","Emma"
"1146",158,"alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew up","Emma"
"1147",158,"when only fourteen—I remember thinking it did her judgment so much","Emma"
"1148",158,"credit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made","Emma"
"1149",158,"out a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of","Emma"
"1150",158,"steady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing requiring","Emma"
"1151",158,"industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the","Emma"
"1152",158,"understanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely","Emma"
"1153",158,"affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.—You never could persuade her","Emma"
"1154",158,"to read half so much as you wished.—You know you could not.”","Emma"
"1155",158,"","Emma"
"1156",158,"“I dare say,” replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, “that I thought so","Emma"
"1157",158,"_then_;—but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma’s omitting","Emma"
"1158",158,"to do any thing I wished.”","Emma"
"1159",158,"","Emma"
"1160",158,"“There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,”—said","Emma"
"1161",158,"Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. “But I,”","Emma"
"1162",158,"he soon added, “who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must","Emma"
"1163",158,"still see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest","Emma"
"1164",158,"of her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able","Emma"
"1165",158,"to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was","Emma"
"1166",158,"always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since","Emma"
"1167",158,"she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In","Emma"
"1168",158,"her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits","Emma"
"1169",158,"her mother’s talents, and must have been under subjection to her.”","Emma"
"1170",158,"","Emma"
"1171",158,"“I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on _your_","Emma"
"1172",158,"recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse’s family and wanted another","Emma"
"1173",158,"situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to","Emma"
"1174",158,"any body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.”","Emma"
"1175",158,"","Emma"
"1176",158,"“Yes,” said he, smiling. “You are better placed _here_; very fit for a","Emma"
"1177",158,"wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself","Emma"
"1178",158,"to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might","Emma"
"1179",158,"not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to","Emma"
"1180",158,"promise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_, on","Emma"
"1181",158,"the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and","Emma"
"1182",158,"doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a","Emma"
"1183",158,"wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.”","Emma"
"1184",158,"","Emma"
"1185",158,"“Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to","Emma"
"1186",158,"such a man as Mr. Weston.”","Emma"
"1187",158,"","Emma"
"1188",158,"“Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and","Emma"
"1189",158,"that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne.","Emma"
"1190",158,"We will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness","Emma"
"1191",158,"of comfort, or his son may plague him.”","Emma"
"1192",158,"","Emma"
"1193",158,"“I hope not _that_.—It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not","Emma"
"1194",158,"foretell vexation from that quarter.”","Emma"
"1195",158,"","Emma"
"1196",158,"“Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma’s","Emma"
"1197",158,"genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the","Emma"
"1198",158,"young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.—But","Emma"
"1199",158,"Harriet Smith—I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her the","Emma"
"1200",158,"very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows","Emma"
"1201",158,"nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a","Emma"
"1202",158,"flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned.","Emma"
"1203",158,"Her ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any","Emma"
"1204",158,"thing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful","Emma"
"1205",158,"inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that _she_","Emma"
"1206",158,"cannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of","Emma"
"1207",158,"conceit with all the other places she belongs to. She will grow just","Emma"
"1208",158,"refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and","Emma"
"1209",158,"circumstances have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma’s","Emma"
"1210",158,"doctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl","Emma"
"1211",158,"adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in","Emma"
"1212",158,"life.—They only give a little polish.”","Emma"
"1213",158,"","Emma"
"1214",158,"“I either depend more upon Emma’s good sense than you do, or am more","Emma"
"1215",158,"anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.","Emma"
"1216",158,"How well she looked last night!”","Emma"
"1217",158,"","Emma"
"1218",158,"“Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very","Emma"
"1219",158,"well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma’s being pretty.”","Emma"
"1220",158,"","Emma"
"1221",158,"“Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect","Emma"
"1222",158,"beauty than Emma altogether—face and figure?”","Emma"
"1223",158,"","Emma"
"1224",158,"“I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom","Emma"
"1225",158,"seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial","Emma"
"1226",158,"old friend.”","Emma"
"1227",158,"","Emma"
"1228",158,"“Such an eye!—the true hazle eye—and so brilliant! regular features,","Emma"
"1229",158,"open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,","Emma"
"1230",158,"and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!","Emma"
"1231",158,"There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her","Emma"
"1232",158,"glance. One hears sometimes of a child being ‘the picture of health;’","Emma"
"1233",158,"now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of","Emma"
"1234",158,"grown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?”","Emma"
"1235",158,"","Emma"
"1236",158,"“I have not a fault to find with her person,” he replied. “I think her","Emma"
"1237",158,"all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise,","Emma"
"1238",158,"that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome","Emma"
"1239",158,"she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies","Emma"
"1240",158,"another way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of","Emma"
"1241",158,"Harriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.”","Emma"
"1242",158,"","Emma"
"1243",158,"“And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not","Emma"
"1244",158,"doing them any harm. With all dear Emma’s little faults, she is an","Emma"
"1245",158,"excellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder","Emma"
"1246",158,"sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be","Emma"
"1247",158,"trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no","Emma"
"1248",158,"lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred","Emma"

"1257",158,"","Emma"
"1258",158,"“I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;","Emma"
"1259",158,"but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,","Emma"
"1260",158,"you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma’s","Emma"
"1261",158,"mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any","Emma"
"1262",158,"possible good can arise from Harriet Smith’s intimacy being made a","Emma"
"1263",158,"matter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any","Emma"
"1264",158,"little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be","Emma"
"1265",158,"expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly","Emma"
"1266",158,"approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a","Emma"
"1267",158,"source of pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province to","Emma"
"1268",158,"give advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this","Emma"

"1270",158,"","Emma"
"1271",158,"“Not at all,” cried he; “I am much obliged to you for it. It is very","Emma"

"1273",158,"found; for it shall be attended to.”","Emma"

"1278",158,"“Be satisfied,” said he, “I will not raise any outcry. I will keep my","Emma"
"1279",158,"ill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabella","Emma"
"1280",158,"does not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest;","Emma"
"1281",158,"perhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one","Emma"
"1282",158,"feels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her!”","Emma"
"1283",158,"","Emma"
"1284",158,"“So do I,” said Mrs. Weston gently, “very much.”","Emma"
"1285",158,"","Emma"
"1286",158,"“She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just","Emma"
"1287",158,"nothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she","Emma"
"1288",158,"cared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love","Emma"
"1289",158,"with a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some","Emma"
"1290",158,"doubt of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobody hereabouts","Emma"

"1294",158,"resolution at present,” said Mrs. Weston, “as can well be; and while","Emma"
"1295",158,"she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any","Emma"

"1312",158,"","Emma"
"1313",158,"","Emma"
"1314",158,"Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet’s fancy a proper","Emma"
"1315",158,"direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good","Emma"
"1316",158,"purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.","Emma"
"1317",158,"Elton’s being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners;","Emma"
"1318",158,"and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his","Emma"
"1319",158,"admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of","Emma"
"1320",158,"creating as much liking on Harriet’s side, as there could be any","Emma"
"1321",158,"occasion for. She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton’s being in the","Emma"
"1322",158,"fairest way of falling in love, if not in love already. She had no","Emma"
"1323",158,"scruple with regard to him. He talked of Harriet, and praised her so","Emma"
"1324",158,"warmly, that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little","Emma"
"1325",158,"time would not add. His perception of the striking improvement of","Emma"
"1326",158,"Harriet’s manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of","Emma"
"1327",158,"the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.","Emma"
"1328",158,"","Emma"
"1329",158,"“You have given Miss Smith all that she required,” said he; “you have","Emma"
"1330",158,"made her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when she came","Emma"
"1331",158,"to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are","Emma"
"1332",158,"infinitely superior to what she received from nature.”","Emma"
"1333",158,"","Emma"
"1334",158,"“I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted","Emma"
"1335",158,"drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the","Emma"
"1336",158,"natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have","Emma"
"1337",158,"done very little.”","Emma"
"1338",158,"","Emma"
"1339",158,"“If it were admissible to contradict a lady,” said the gallant Mr.","Emma"
"1340",158,"Elton—","Emma"
"1341",158,"","Emma"
"1342",158,"“I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have","Emma"
"1343",158,"taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.”","Emma"
"1344",158,"","Emma"
"1345",158,"“Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded","Emma"
"1346",158,"decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!”","Emma"
"1347",158,"","Emma"
"1348",158,"“Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition","Emma"
"1349",158,"more truly amiable.”","Emma"
"1350",158,"","Emma"
"1351",158,"“I have no doubt of it.” And it was spoken with a sort of sighing","Emma"
"1352",158,"animation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleased","Emma"
"1353",158,"another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers,","Emma"
"1354",158,"to have Harriet’s picture.","Emma"
"1355",158,"","Emma"
"1356",158,"“Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?” said she: “did you","Emma"
"1357",158,"ever sit for your picture?”","Emma"
"1358",158,"","Emma"
"1359",158,"Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,","Emma"
"1360",158,"with a very interesting naïveté,","Emma"
"1361",158,"","Emma"
"1362",158,"“Oh! dear, no, never.”","Emma"
"1363",158,"","Emma"
"1364",158,"No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,","Emma"
"1365",158,"","Emma"
"1366",158,"“What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would","Emma"
"1367",158,"give any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.","Emma"
"1368",158,"You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great","Emma"
"1369",158,"passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and","Emma"
"1370",158,"was thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But from one cause or","Emma"
"1371",158,"another, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture,","Emma"
"1372",158,"if Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delight to have her","Emma"
"1373",158,"picture!”","Emma"
"1374",158,"","Emma"
"1375",158,"“Let me entreat you,” cried Mr. Elton; “it would indeed be a delight!","Emma"
"1376",158,"Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in","Emma"
"1377",158,"favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could you","Emma"
"1378",158,"suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your","Emma"
"1379",158,"landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable","Emma"
"1380",158,"figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?”","Emma"
"1381",158,"","Emma"
"1382",158,"Yes, good man!—thought Emma—but what has all that to do with taking","Emma"
"1383",158,"likenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don’t pretend to be in","Emma"
"1384",158,"raptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet’s face. “Well, if","Emma"
"1385",158,"you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try","Emma"
"1386",158,"what I can do. Harriet’s features are very delicate, which makes a","Emma"
"1387",158,"likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the","Emma"
"1388",158,"eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch.”","Emma"
"1389",158,"","Emma"
"1390",158,"“Exactly so—The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth—I have","Emma"
"1391",158,"not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do it,","Emma"
"1392",158,"it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.”","Emma"
"1393",158,"","Emma"
"1394",158,"“But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She thinks","Emma"
"1395",158,"so little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of","Emma"
"1396",158,"answering me? How completely it meant, ‘why should my picture be","Emma"
"1397",158,"drawn?’”","Emma"
"1398",158,"","Emma"
"1399",158,"“Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still","Emma"
"1400",158,"I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.”","Emma"
"1401",158,"","Emma"
"1402",158,"Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;","Emma"
"1403",158,"and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the","Emma"
"1404",158,"earnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work","Emma"
"1405",158,"directly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various","Emma"
"1406",158,"attempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that","Emma"
"1407",158,"they might decide together on the best size for Harriet. Her many","Emma"
"1408",158,"beginnings were displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,","Emma"
"1409",158,"pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn. She had","Emma"
"1410",158,"always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both in","Emma"
"1411",158,"drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as","Emma"
"1412",158,"she would ever submit to. She played and sang;—and drew in almost every","Emma"
"1413",158,"style; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had she","Emma"
"1414",158,"approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to","Emma"
"1415",158,"command, and ought not to have failed of. She was not much deceived as","Emma"
"1416",158,"to her own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she was not","Emma"
"1417",158,"unwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her reputation for","Emma"
"1418",158,"accomplishment often higher than it deserved.","Emma"
"1419",158,"","Emma"
"1420",158,"There was merit in every drawing—in the least finished, perhaps the","Emma"
"1421",158,"most; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had","Emma"
"1422",158,"there been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two","Emma"
"1423",158,"companions would have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A","Emma"
"1424",158,"likeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse’s performances must be","Emma"
"1425",158,"capital.","Emma"
"1426",158,"","Emma"
"1427",158,"“No great variety of faces for you,” said Emma. “I had only my own","Emma"
"1428",158,"family to study from. There is my father—another of my father—but the","Emma"
"1429",158,"idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could only","Emma"
"1430",158,"take him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston","Emma"
"1431",158,"again, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my","Emma"
"1432",158,"kindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her.","Emma"
"1433",158,"There is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!—and","Emma"
"1434",158,"the face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she","Emma"
"1435",158,"would have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her","Emma"
"1436",158,"four children that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all my","Emma"
"1437",158,"attempts at three of those four children;—there they are, Henry and","Emma"
"1438",158,"John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of","Emma"
"1439",158,"them might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them","Emma"
"1440",158,"drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three","Emma"
"1441",158,"or four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take","Emma"
"1442",158,"any likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are","Emma"
"1443",158,"coarser featured than any of mama’s children ever were. Here is my","Emma"
"1444",158,"sketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on","Emma"
"1445",158,"the sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would","Emma"
"1446",158,"wish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That’s","Emma"
"1447",158,"very like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa","Emma"
"1448",158,"is very good. Then here is my last,”—unclosing a pretty sketch of a","Emma"
"1449",158,"gentleman in small size, whole-length—“my last and my best—my brother,","Emma"
"1450",158,"Mr. John Knightley.—This did not want much of being finished, when I","Emma"
"1451",158,"put it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I","Emma"
"1452",158,"could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had","Emma"
"1453",158,"really made a very good likeness of it—(Mrs. Weston and I were quite","Emma"
"1454",158,"agreed in thinking it _very_ like)—only too handsome—too flattering—but","Emma"
"1455",158,"that was a fault on the right side”—after all this, came poor dear","Emma"
"1456",158,"Isabella’s cold approbation of—“Yes, it was a little like—but to be","Emma"
"1457",158,"sure it did not do him justice. We had had a great deal of trouble in","Emma"
"1458",158,"persuading him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and","Emma"
"1459",158,"altogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish","Emma"
"1460",158,"it, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every","Emma"
"1461",158,"morning visitor in Brunswick Square;—and, as I said, I did then","Emma"
"1462",158,"forswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet’s sake, or rather","Emma"
"1463",158,"for my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_","Emma"
"1464",158,"_present_, I will break my resolution now.”","Emma"
"1465",158,"","Emma"
"1466",158,"Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and","Emma"
"1467",158,"was repeating, “No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as","Emma"
"1468",158,"you observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,” with so interesting a","Emma"
"1469",158,"consciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better","Emma"
"1470",158,"leave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the","Emma"
"1471",158,"declaration must wait a little longer.","Emma"
"1472",158,"","Emma"
"1473",158,"She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be a","Emma"
"1474",158,"whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley’s, and was","Emma"
"1475",158,"destined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable","Emma"
"1476",158,"station over the mantelpiece.","Emma"
"1477",158,"","Emma"
"1478",158,"The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not","Emma"
"1479",158,"keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of","Emma"
"1480",158,"youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no","Emma"
"1481",158,"doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every","Emma"
"1482",158,"touch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze","Emma"
"1483",158,"and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to","Emma"
"1484",158,"it, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her","Emma"
"1485",158,"to employ him in reading.","Emma"
"1486",158,"","Emma"
"1487",158,"“If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness","Emma"
"1488",158,"indeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen","Emma"
"1489",158,"the irksomeness of Miss Smith’s.”","Emma"
"1490",158,"","Emma"
"1491",158,"Mr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.","Emma"
"1492",158,"She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing","Emma"
"1493",158,"less would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready","Emma"
"1494",158,"at the smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the","Emma"
"1495",158,"progress, and be charmed.—There was no being displeased with such an","Emma"
"1496",158,"encourager, for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost","Emma"
"1497",158,"before it was possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and","Emma"
"1498",158,"his complaisance were unexceptionable.","Emma"
"1499",158,"","Emma"
"1500",158,"The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough","Emma"
"1501",158,"pleased with the first day’s sketch to wish to go on. There was no want","Emma"
"1502",158,"of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant","Emma"
"1503",158,"to throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more","Emma"
"1504",158,"height, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of its","Emma"
"1505",158,"being in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its","Emma"
"1506",158,"destined place with credit to them both—a standing memorial of the","Emma"
"1507",158,"beauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with","Emma"
"1508",158,"as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton’s very promising","Emma"
"1509",158,"attachment was likely to add.","Emma"
"1510",158,"","Emma"
"1511",158,"Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,","Emma"
"1512",158,"entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.","Emma"
"1513",158,"","Emma"
"1514",158,"“By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the","Emma"
"1515",158,"party.”","Emma"
"1516",158,"","Emma"
"1517",158,"The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,","Emma"
"1518",158,"took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the","Emma"
"1519",158,"picture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased,","Emma"
"1520",158,"but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every","Emma"
"1521",158,"criticism.","Emma"
"1522",158,"","Emma"
"1523",158,"“Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she","Emma"
"1524",158,"wanted,”—observed Mrs. Weston to him—not in the least suspecting that","Emma"
"1525",158,"she was addressing a lover.—“The expression of the eye is most correct,","Emma"
"1526",158,"but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the fault of","Emma"
"1527",158,"her face that she has them not.”","Emma"
"1528",158,"","Emma"
"1529",158,"“Do you think so?” replied he. “I cannot agree with you. It appears to","Emma"
"1530",158,"me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a","Emma"
"1531",158,"likeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.”","Emma"
"1532",158,"","Emma"
"1533",158,"“You have made her too tall, Emma,” said Mr. Knightley.","Emma"
"1534",158,"","Emma"
"1535",158,"Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly","Emma"
"1536",158,"added,","Emma"
"1537",158,"","Emma"
"1538",158,"“Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider,","Emma"
"1539",158,"she is sitting down—which naturally presents a different—which in short","Emma"
"1540",158,"gives exactly the idea—and the proportions must be preserved, you know.","Emma"
"1541",158,"Proportions, fore-shortening.—Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of","Emma"
"1542",158,"such a height as Miss Smith’s. Exactly so indeed!”","Emma"
"1543",158,"","Emma"
"1544",158,"“It is very pretty,” said Mr. Woodhouse. “So prettily done! Just as","Emma"
"1545",158,"your drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so","Emma"
"1546",158,"well as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she","Emma"
"1547",158,"seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her","Emma"
"1548",158,"shoulders—and it makes one think she must catch cold.”","Emma"
"1549",158,"","Emma"
"1550",158,"“But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.","Emma"
"1551",158,"Look at the tree.”","Emma"
"1552",158,"","Emma"
"1553",158,"“But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.”","Emma"
"1554",158,"","Emma"
"1555",158,"“You, sir, may say any thing,” cried Mr. Elton, “but I must confess","Emma"

"1557",158,"of doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any","Emma"
"1558",158,"other situation would have been much less in character. The naïveté of","Emma"
"1559",158,"Miss Smith’s manners—and altogether—Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot","Emma"
"1560",158,"keep my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.”","Emma"
"1561",158,"","Emma"
"1562",158,"The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a","Emma"
"1563",158,"few difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London;","Emma"
"1564",158,"the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose","Emma"
"1565",158,"taste could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all","Emma"
"1566",158,"commissions, must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr.","Emma"
"1567",158,"Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in","Emma"
"1568",158,"the fogs of December. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr.","Emma"
"1569",158,"Elton, than it was removed. His gallantry was always on the alert.","Emma"
"1570",158,"“Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure should","Emma"
"1571",158,"he have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time. It was","Emma"
"1572",158,"impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on","Emma"
"1573",158,"such an errand.”","Emma"
"1574",158,"","Emma"

"1579",158,"","Emma"
"1580",158,"Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give","Emma"

"1582",158,"safety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of","Emma"
"1583",158,"not being incommoded enough.","Emma"
"1584",158,"","Emma"
"1585",158,"“What a precious deposit!” said he with a tender sigh, as he received","Emma"

"1588",158,"“This man is almost too gallant to be in love,” thought Emma. “I should","Emma"

"1590",158,"being in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet","Emma"
"1591",158,"exactly; it will be an ‘Exactly so,’ as he says himself; but he does","Emma"
"1592",158,"sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could","Emma"

"1600",158,"","Emma"
"1601",158,"","Emma"
"1602",158,"The very day of Mr. Elton’s going to London produced a fresh occasion","Emma"
"1603",158,"for Emma’s services towards her friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield,","Emma"
"1604",158,"as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to","Emma"
"1605",158,"return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been talked","Emma"
"1606",158,"of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something","Emma"
"1607",158,"extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half a","Emma"
"1608",158,"minute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back to","Emma"
"1609",158,"Mrs. Goddard’s, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and","Emma"
"1610",158,"finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a","Emma"
"1611",158,"little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on","Emma"
"1612",158,"opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs","Emma"
"1613",158,"which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this","Emma"
"1614",158,"letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal","Emma"
"1615",158,"of marriage. “Who could have thought it? She was so surprized she did","Emma"
"1616",158,"not know what to do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good","Emma"
"1617",158,"letter, at least she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved her","Emma"
"1618",158,"very much—but she did not know—and so, she was come as fast as she","Emma"
"1619",158,"could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.—” Emma was half-ashamed","Emma"
"1620",158,"of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.","Emma"
"1621",158,"","Emma"
"1622",158,"“Upon my word,” she cried, “the young man is determined not to lose any","Emma"
"1623",158,"thing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can.”","Emma"
"1624",158,"","Emma"
"1625",158,"“Will you read the letter?” cried Harriet. “Pray do. II’d rather you","Emma"
"1626",158,"would.”","Emma"
"1627",158,"","Emma"
"1628",158,"Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The","Emma"
"1629",158,"style of the letter was much above her expectation. There were not","Emma"
"1630",158,"merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have","Emma"
"1631",158,"disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and","Emma"
"1632",158,"unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of","Emma"
"1633",158,"the writer. It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment,","Emma"
"1634",158,"liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. She paused over it,","Emma"
"1635",158,"while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion, with a “Well,","Emma"
"1636",158,"well,” and was at last forced to add, “Is it a good letter? or is it","Emma"
"1637",158,"too short?”","Emma"
"1638",158,"","Emma"
"1639",158,"“Yes, indeed, a very good letter,” replied Emma rather slowly—“so good","Emma"
"1640",158,"a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his","Emma"
"1641",158,"sisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom I","Emma"
"1642",158,"saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if","Emma"
"1643",158,"left quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;","Emma"
"1644",158,"no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a","Emma"
"1645",158,"woman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural","Emma"
"1646",158,"talent for—thinks strongly and clearly—and when he takes a pen in hand,","Emma"
"1647",158,"his thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men. Yes,","Emma"
"1648",158,"I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a","Emma"
"1649",158,"certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet (returning","Emma"
"1650",158,"it,) than I had expected.”","Emma"
"1651",158,"","Emma"
"1652",158,"“Well,” said the still waiting Harriet;—“well—and—and what shall I do?”","Emma"
"1653",158,"","Emma"
"1654",158,"“What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this","Emma"
"1655",158,"letter?”","Emma"
"1656",158,"","Emma"
"1657",158,"“Yes.”","Emma"
"1658",158,"","Emma"
"1659",158,"“But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course—and","Emma"
"1660",158,"speedily.”","Emma"
"1661",158,"","Emma"
"1662",158,"“Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.”","Emma"
"1663",158,"","Emma"
"1664",158,"“Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will","Emma"
"1665",158,"express yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your","Emma"
"1666",158,"not being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be","Emma"
"1667",158,"unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and","Emma"
"1668",158,"concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will","Emma"
"1669",158,"present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded. You need","Emma"
"1670",158,"not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his","Emma"
"1671",158,"disappointment.”","Emma"
"1672",158,"","Emma"
"1673",158,"“You think I ought to refuse him then,” said Harriet, looking down.","Emma"
"1674",158,"","Emma"
"1675",158,"“Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any","Emma"
"1676",158,"doubt as to that? I thought—but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been","Emma"
"1677",158,"under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you","Emma"
"1678",158,"feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer. I had imagined you","Emma"
"1679",158,"were consulting me only as to the wording of it.”","Emma"
"1680",158,"","Emma"
"1681",158,"Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:","Emma"
"1682",158,"","Emma"
"1683",158,"“You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.”","Emma"
"1684",158,"","Emma"
"1685",158,"“No, I do not; that is, I do not mean—What shall I do? What would you","Emma"
"1686",158,"advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to","Emma"
"1687",158,"do.”","Emma"
"1688",158,"","Emma"
"1689",158,"“I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do","Emma"
"1690",158,"with it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.”","Emma"
"1691",158,"","Emma"
"1692",158,"“I had no notion that he liked me so very much,” said Harriet,","Emma"
"1693",158,"contemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her","Emma"
"1694",158,"silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that","Emma"
"1695",158,"letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,","Emma"
"1696",158,"","Emma"
"1697",158,"“I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_ as","Emma"
"1698",158,"to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to","Emma"
"1699",158,"refuse him. If she can hesitate as to ‘Yes,’ she ought to say ‘No’","Emma"
"1700",158,"directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful","Emma"
"1701",158,"feelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and","Emma"
"1702",158,"older than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I","Emma"
"1703",158,"want to influence you.”","Emma"
"1704",158,"","Emma"
"1705",158,"“Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to—but if you would","Emma"
"1706",158,"just advise me what I had best do—No, no, I do not mean that—As you","Emma"
"1707",158,"say, one’s mind ought to be quite made up—One should not be","Emma"
"1708",158,"hesitating—It is a very serious thing.—It will be safer to say ‘No,’","Emma"
"1709",158,"perhaps.—Do you think I had better say ‘No?’”","Emma"
"1710",158,"","Emma"
"1711",158,"“Not for the world,” said Emma, smiling graciously, “would I advise you","Emma"
"1712",158,"either way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you","Emma"
"1713",158,"prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most","Emma"
"1714",158,"agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you","Emma"
"1715",158,"hesitate? You blush, Harriet.—Does any body else occur to you at this","Emma"
"1716",158,"moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive","Emma"
"1717",158,"yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this","Emma"
"1718",158,"moment whom are you thinking of?”","Emma"
"1719",158,"","Emma"
"1720",158,"The symptoms were favourable.—Instead of answering, Harriet turned away","Emma"
"1721",158,"confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was","Emma"
"1722",158,"still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without","Emma"
"1723",158,"regard. Emma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong","Emma"
"1724",158,"hopes. At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said—","Emma"
"1725",158,"","Emma"
"1726",158,"“Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as","Emma"
"1727",158,"well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really","Emma"
"1728",158,"almost made up my mind—to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?”","Emma"
"1729",158,"","Emma"
"1730",158,"“Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just","Emma"
"1731",158,"what you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to","Emma"
"1732",158,"myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation","Emma"
"1733",158,"in approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would have","Emma"
"1734",158,"grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the","Emma"
"1735",158,"consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest","Emma"
"1736",158,"degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not","Emma"
"1737",158,"influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could","Emma"
"1738",158,"not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am","Emma"
"1739",158,"secure of you for ever.”","Emma"
"1740",158,"","Emma"
"1741",158,"Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her","Emma"
"1742",158,"forcibly.","Emma"
"1743",158,"","Emma"
"1744",158,"“You could not have visited me!” she cried, looking aghast. “No, to be","Emma"
"1745",158,"sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would have","Emma"
"1746",158,"been too dreadful!—What an escape!—Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not","Emma"
"1747",158,"give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any","Emma"
"1748",158,"thing in the world.”","Emma"
"1749",158,"","Emma"
"1750",158,"“Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it","Emma"
"1751",158,"must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society.","Emma"
"1752",158,"I must have given you up.”","Emma"
"1753",158,"","Emma"
"1754",158,"“Dear me!—How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me","Emma"
"1755",158,"never to come to Hartfield any more!”","Emma"
"1756",158,"","Emma"
"1757",158,"“Dear affectionate creature!—_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!—_You_","Emma"
"1758",158,"confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I","Emma"
"1759",158,"wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He must","Emma"
"1760",158,"have a pretty good opinion of himself.”","Emma"
"1761",158,"","Emma"
"1762",158,"“I do not think he is conceited either, in general,” said Harriet, her","Emma"
"1763",158,"conscience opposing such censure; “at least, he is very good natured,","Emma"
"1764",158,"and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard","Emma"
"1765",158,"for—but that is quite a different thing from—and you know, though he","Emma"
"1766",158,"may like me, it does not follow that I should—and certainly I must","Emma"
"1767",158,"confess that since my visiting here I have seen people—and if one comes","Emma"
"1768",158,"to compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all,","Emma"
"1769",158,"_one_ is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr.","Emma"
"1770",158,"Martin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and","Emma"
"1771",158,"his being so much attached to me—and his writing such a letter—but as","Emma"
"1772",158,"to leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.”","Emma"
"1773",158,"","Emma"
"1774",158,"“Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be","Emma"
"1775",158,"parted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or","Emma"
"1776",158,"because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.”","Emma"
"1777",158,"","Emma"
"1778",158,"“Oh no;—and it is but a short letter too.”","Emma"
"1779",158,"","Emma"
"1780",158,"Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a “very","Emma"
"1781",158,"true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish","Emma"
"1782",158,"manner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that","Emma"
"1783",158,"her husband could write a good letter.”","Emma"
"1784",158,"","Emma"
"1785",158,"“Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always","Emma"
"1786",158,"happy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him.","Emma"
"1787",158,"But how shall I do? What shall I say?”","Emma"
"1788",158,"","Emma"
"1789",158,"Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and","Emma"
"1790",158,"advised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of","Emma"
"1791",158,"her assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any","Emma"
"1792",158,"assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every","Emma"
"1793",158,"sentence. The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had","Emma"
"1794",158,"such a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace","Emma"
"1795",158,"her up with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much","Emma"
"1796",158,"concerned at the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of","Emma"
"1797",158,"what his mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious","Emma"
"1798",158,"that they should not fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the","Emma"
"1799",158,"young man had come in her way at that moment, he would have been","Emma"
"1800",158,"accepted after all.","Emma"
"1801",158,"","Emma"
"1802",158,"This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business","Emma"
"1803",158,"was finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, but","Emma"
"1804",158,"Emma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them","Emma"
"1805",158,"by speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the","Emma"
"1806",158,"idea of Mr. Elton.","Emma"
"1807",158,"","Emma"
"1808",158,"“I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,” was said in rather a","Emma"
"1809",158,"sorrowful tone.","Emma"
"1810",158,"","Emma"
"1811",158,"“Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You","Emma"

"1817",158,"","Emma"
"1818",158,"Some time afterwards it was, “I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much","Emma"
"1819",158,"surprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would—for","Emma"
"1820",158,"Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a","Emma"

"1822",158,"","Emma"
"1823",158,"“One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher","Emma"

"1825",158,"opportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear","Emma"
"1826",158,"valuable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she","Emma"
"1827",158,"is quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be","Emma"
"1828",158,"among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I are","Emma"

"1831",158,"","Emma"
"1832",158,"Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that","Emma"
"1833",158,"people should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly","Emma"
"1834",158,"cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards","Emma"

"1836",158,"","Emma"
"1837",158,"“Now he has got my letter,” said she softly. “I wonder what they are","Emma"

"1867",158,"spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have a","Emma"
"1868",158,"bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every","Emma"
"1869",158,"respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible","Emma"
"1870",158,"just at present. She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or","Emma"
"1871",158,"two to Mrs. Goddard’s, but it was then to be settled that she should","Emma"
"1872",158,"return to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.","Emma"
"1873",158,"","Emma"
"1874",158,"While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.","Emma"
"1875",158,"Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his","Emma"
"1876",158,"mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and","Emma"
"1877",158,"was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of","Emma"
"1878",158,"his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr.","Emma"
"1879",158,"Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his","Emma"
"1880",158,"short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies","Emma"
"1881",158,"and civil hesitations of the other.","Emma"
"1882",158,"","Emma"
"1883",158,"“Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not","Emma"
"1884",158,"consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma’s advice and","Emma"
"1885",158,"go out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had","Emma"
"1886",158,"better take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony,","Emma"
"1887",158,"Mr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people.”","Emma"
"1888",158,"","Emma"
"1889",158,"“My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.”","Emma"
"1890",158,"","Emma"
"1891",158,"“I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to","Emma"
"1892",158,"entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my","Emma"
"1893",158,"three turns—my winter walk.”","Emma"
"1894",158,"","Emma"
"1895",158,"“You cannot do better, sir.”","Emma"
"1896",158,"","Emma"
"1897",158,"“I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am","Emma"
"1898",158,"a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides,","Emma"
"1899",158,"you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.”","Emma"
"1900",158,"","Emma"
"1901",158,"“Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think","Emma"
"1902",158,"the sooner _you_ go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open","Emma"
"1903",158,"the garden door for you.”","Emma"
"1904",158,"","Emma"
"1905",158,"Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being","Emma"
"1906",158,"immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more","Emma"
"1907",158,"chat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with more","Emma"
"1908",158,"voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.","Emma"
"1909",158,"","Emma"
"1910",158,"“I cannot rate her beauty as you do,” said he; “but she is a pretty","Emma"
"1911",158,"little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her","Emma"
"1912",158,"disposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good","Emma"
"1913",158,"hands she will turn out a valuable woman.”","Emma"
"1914",158,"","Emma"
"1915",158,"“I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be","Emma"
"1916",158,"wanting.”","Emma"
"1917",158,"","Emma"
"1918",158,"“Come,” said he, “you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you","Emma"
"1919",158,"that you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl’s","Emma"
"1920",158,"giggle; she really does you credit.”","Emma"
"1921",158,"","Emma"
"1922",158,"“Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had","Emma"
"1923",158,"been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where","Emma"
"1924",158,"they may. _You_ do not often overpower me with it.”","Emma"
"1925",158,"","Emma"
"1926",158,"“You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?”","Emma"
"1927",158,"","Emma"
"1928",158,"“Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she","Emma"
"1929",158,"intended.”","Emma"
"1930",158,"","Emma"
"1931",158,"“Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.”","Emma"
"1932",158,"","Emma"
"1933",158,"“Highbury gossips!—Tiresome wretches!”","Emma"
"1934",158,"","Emma"
"1935",158,"“Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.”","Emma"
"1936",158,"","Emma"
"1937",158,"Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said","Emma"
"1938",158,"nothing. He presently added, with a smile,","Emma"
"1939",158,"","Emma"
"1940",158,"“I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I","Emma"
"1941",158,"have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of","Emma"
"1942",158,"something to her advantage.”","Emma"
"1943",158,"","Emma"
"1944",158,"“Indeed! how so? of what sort?”","Emma"
"1945",158,"","Emma"
"1946",158,"“A very serious sort, I assure you;” still smiling.","Emma"
"1947",158,"","Emma"
"1948",158,"“Very serious! I can think of but one thing—Who is in love with her?","Emma"
"1949",158,"Who makes you their confidant?”","Emma"
"1950",158,"","Emma"
"1951",158,"Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton’s having dropt a hint.","Emma"
"1952",158,"Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew","Emma"
"1953",158,"Mr. Elton looked up to him.","Emma"
"1954",158,"","Emma"
"1955",158,"“I have reason to think,” he replied, “that Harriet Smith will soon","Emma"
"1956",158,"have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable","Emma"
"1957",158,"quarter:—Robert Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this","Emma"
"1958",158,"summer, seems to have done his business. He is desperately in love and","Emma"
"1959",158,"means to marry her.”","Emma"
"1960",158,"","Emma"
"1961",158,"“He is very obliging,” said Emma; “but is he sure that Harriet means to","Emma"
"1962",158,"marry him?”","Emma"
"1963",158,"","Emma"
"1964",158,"“Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to","Emma"
"1965",158,"the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows","Emma"
"1966",158,"I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe,","Emma"
"1967",158,"considers me as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whether I","Emma"
"1968",158,"thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether I","Emma"
"1969",158,"thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice","Emma"
"1970",158,"altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered","Emma"
"1971",158,"(especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line of society","Emma"
"1972",158,"above him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear","Emma"
"1973",158,"better sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the","Emma"
"1974",158,"purpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every","Emma"
"1975",158,"thing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in","Emma"
"1976",158,"the event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son","Emma"
"1977",158,"and brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to","Emma"
"1978",158,"me that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he","Emma"
"1979",158,"could not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent","Emma"
"1980",158,"him away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he","Emma"
"1981",158,"would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house","Emma"
"1982",158,"thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened","Emma"
"1983",158,"the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not","Emma"
"1984",158,"allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not","Emma"
"1985",158,"appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be","Emma"
"1986",158,"at Mrs. Goddard’s to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without","Emma"
"1987",158,"thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.”","Emma"
"1988",158,"","Emma"
"1989",158,"“Pray, Mr. Knightley,” said Emma, who had been smiling to herself","Emma"
"1990",158,"through a great part of this speech, “how do you know that Mr. Martin","Emma"
"1991",158,"did not speak yesterday?”","Emma"
"1992",158,"","Emma"
"1993",158,"“Certainly,” replied he, surprized, “I do not absolutely know it; but","Emma"
"1994",158,"it may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?”","Emma"
"1995",158,"","Emma"
"1996",158,"“Come,” said she, “I will tell you something, in return for what you","Emma"
"1997",158,"have told me. He did speak yesterday—that is, he wrote, and was","Emma"
"1998",158,"refused.”","Emma"
"1999",158,"","Emma"
"2000",158,"This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.","Emma"
"2001",158,"Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he","Emma"
"2002",158,"stood up, in tall indignation, and said,","Emma"
"2003",158,"","Emma"
"2004",158,"“Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the","Emma"
"2005",158,"foolish girl about?”","Emma"
"2006",158,"","Emma"
"2007",158,"“Oh! to be sure,” cried Emma, “it is always incomprehensible to a man","Emma"
"2008",158,"that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always","Emma"
"2009",158,"imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.”","Emma"
"2010",158,"","Emma"
"2011",158,"“Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the","Emma"
"2012",158,"meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is","Emma"
"2013",158,"so; but I hope you are mistaken.”","Emma"
"2014",158,"","Emma"
"2015",158,"“I saw her answer!—nothing could be clearer.”","Emma"
"2016",158,"","Emma"
"2017",158,"“You saw her answer!—you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your","Emma"
"2018",158,"doing. You persuaded her to refuse him.”","Emma"
"2019",158,"","Emma"
"2020",158,"“And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not","Emma"
"2021",158,"feel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,","Emma"
"2022",158,"but I cannot admit him to be Harriet’s equal; and am rather surprized","Emma"
"2023",158,"indeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he","Emma"
"2024",158,"does seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever","Emma"
"2025",158,"got over.”","Emma"
"2026",158,"","Emma"
"2027",158,"“Not Harriet’s equal!” exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and","Emma"
"2028",158,"with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, “No, he is not","Emma"
"2029",158,"her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in","Emma"
"2030",158,"situation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are","Emma"
"2031",158,"Harriet Smith’s claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any","Emma"
"2032",158,"connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of","Emma"
"2033",158,"nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and","Emma"
"2034",158,"certainly no respectable relations. She is known only as","Emma"
"2035",158,"parlour-boarder at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a","Emma"
"2036",158,"girl of any information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too","Emma"
"2037",158,"young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she","Emma"
"2038",158,"can have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely","Emma"
"2039",158,"ever to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good","Emma"
"2040",158,"tempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on","Emma"
"2041",158,"his account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.","Emma"
"2042",158,"I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better;","Emma"
"2043",158,"and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do","Emma"
"2044",158,"worse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to","Emma"
"2045",158,"trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of","Emma"
"2046",158,"disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright","Emma"
"2047",158,"and turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on","Emma"
"2048",158,"her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there","Emma"
"2049",158,"would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even _your_","Emma"
"2050",158,"satisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you","Emma"
"2051",158,"would not regret your friend’s leaving Highbury, for the sake of her","Emma"
"2052",158,"being settled so well. I remember saying to myself, ‘Even Emma, with","Emma"
"2053",158,"all her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.’”","Emma"
"2054",158,"","Emma"
"2055",158,"“I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say","Emma"
"2056",158,"any such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all","Emma"
"2057",158,"his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate","Emma"
"2058",158,"friend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man","Emma"
"2059",158,"whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you","Emma"
"2060",158,"should think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you","Emma"
"2061",158,"mine are very different. I must think your statement by no means fair.","Emma"
"2062",158,"You are not just to Harriet’s claims. They would be estimated very","Emma"
"2063",158,"differently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest","Emma"
"2064",158,"of the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in","Emma"
"2065",158,"society.—The sphere in which she moves is much above his.—It would be a","Emma"
"2066",158,"degradation.”","Emma"
"2067",158,"","Emma"
"2068",158,"“A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a","Emma"
"2069",158,"respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!”","Emma"
"2070",158,"","Emma"
"2071",158,"“As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may","Emma"
"2072",158,"be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay","Emma"
"2073",158,"for the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with","Emma"
"2074",158,"whom she is brought up.—There can scarcely be a doubt that her father","Emma"
"2075",158,"is a gentleman—and a gentleman of fortune.—Her allowance is very","Emma"
"2076",158,"liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or","Emma"
"2077",158,"comfort.—That she is a gentleman’s daughter, is indubitable to me; that","Emma"
"2078",158,"she associates with gentlemen’s daughters, no one, I apprehend, will","Emma"
"2079",158,"deny.—She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.”","Emma"
"2080",158,"","Emma"
"2081",158,"“Whoever might be her parents,” said Mr. Knightley, “whoever may have","Emma"
"2082",158,"had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of","Emma"
"2083",158,"their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.","Emma"
"2084",158,"After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs.","Emma"
"2085",158,"Goddard’s hands to shift as she can;—to move, in short, in Mrs.","Emma"
"2086",158,"Goddard’s line, to have Mrs. Goddard’s acquaintance. Her friends","Emma"
"2087",158,"evidently thought this good enough for her; and it _was_ good enough.","Emma"
"2088",158,"She desired nothing better herself. Till you chose to turn her into a","Emma"
"2089",158,"friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition","Emma"
"2090",158,"beyond it. She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer.","Emma"
"2091",158,"She had no sense of superiority then. If she has it now, you have given","Emma"
"2092",158,"it. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would","Emma"
"2093",158,"never have proceeded so far, if he had not felt persuaded of her not","Emma"
"2094",158,"being disinclined to him. I know him well. He has too much real feeling","Emma"
"2095",158,"to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to","Emma"
"2096",158,"conceit, he is the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it","Emma"
"2097",158,"he had encouragement.”","Emma"
"2098",158,"","Emma"
"2099",158,"It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this","Emma"
"2100",158,"assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject","Emma"
"2101",158,"again.","Emma"
"2102",158,"","Emma"
"2103",158,"“You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are","Emma"
"2104",158,"unjust to Harriet. Harriet’s claims to marry well are not so","Emma"
"2105",158,"contemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she","Emma"
"2106",158,"has better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have","Emma"
"2107",158,"her understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point,","Emma"
"2108",158,"however, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and","Emma"
"2109",158,"good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them,","Emma"
"2110",158,"they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she","Emma"
"2111",158,"is, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine","Emma"
"2112",158,"people out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more","Emma"
"2113",158,"philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed;","Emma"
"2114",158,"till they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome","Emma"
"2115",158,"faces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of","Emma"
"2116",158,"being admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from","Emma"
"2117",158,"among many, consequently a claim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is","Emma"
"2118",158,"not so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough","Emma"
"2119",158,"sweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a","Emma"
"2120",158,"great readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very much","Emma"
"2121",158,"mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such","Emma"
"2122",158,"temper, the highest claims a woman could possess.”","Emma"
"2123",158,"","Emma"
"2124",158,"“Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost","Emma"
"2125",158,"enough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply","Emma"
"2126",158,"it as you do.”","Emma"
"2127",158,"","Emma"
"2128",158,"“To be sure!” cried she playfully. “I know _that_ is the feeling of you","Emma"
"2129",158,"all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man","Emma"
"2130",158,"delights in—what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his","Emma"
"2131",158,"judgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to","Emma"
"2132",158,"marry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just","Emma"
"2133",158,"entering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at","Emma"
"2134",158,"because she does not accept the first offer she receives? No—pray let","Emma"
"2135",158,"her have time to look about her.”","Emma"
"2136",158,"","Emma"
"2137",158,"“I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,” said Mr. Knightley","Emma"
"2138",158,"presently, “though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now","Emma"
"2139",158,"perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will","Emma"
"2140",158,"puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a","Emma"
"2141",158,"claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good","Emma"
"2142",158,"enough for her. Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of","Emma"
"2143",158,"mischief. Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations","Emma"
"2144",158,"too high. Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so","Emma"
"2145",158,"fast, though she is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may","Emma"
"2146",158,"chuse to say, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very","Emma"
"2147",158,"fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity—and most","Emma"
"2148",158,"prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they","Emma"
"2149",158,"might be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be","Emma"
"2150",158,"revealed. Let her marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable,","Emma"
"2151",158,"and happy for ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry","Emma"
"2152",158,"greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of","Emma"
"2153",158,"consequence and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs.","Emma"
"2154",158,"Goddard’s all the rest of her life—or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is","Emma"
"2155",158,"a girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and","Emma"
"2156",158,"is glad to catch at the old writing-master’s son.”","Emma"
"2157",158,"","Emma"
"2158",158,"“We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there","Emma"
"2159",158,"can be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more","Emma"
"2160",158,"angry. But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin, it is","Emma"
"2161",158,"impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must","Emma"
"2162",158,"prevent any second application. She must abide by the evil of having","Emma"
"2163",158,"refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will","Emma"
"2164",158,"not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little; but I","Emma"
"2165",158,"assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do. His","Emma"
"2166",158,"appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if she","Emma"
"2167",158,"ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now. I can imagine, that","Emma"
"2168",158,"before she had seen any body superior, she might tolerate him. He was","Emma"
"2169",158,"the brother of her friends, and he took pains to please her; and","Emma"
"2170",158,"altogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his great","Emma"
"2171",158,"assistant) she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him","Emma"
"2172",158,"disagreeable. But the case is altered now. She knows now what gentlemen","Emma"
"2173",158,"are; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance","Emma"
"2174",158,"with Harriet.”","Emma"
"2175",158,"","Emma"
"2176",158,"“Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!” cried Mr.","Emma"
"2177",158,"Knightley.—“Robert Martin’s manners have sense, sincerity, and","Emma"
"2178",158,"good-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentility","Emma"
"2179",158,"than Harriet Smith could understand.”","Emma"
"2180",158,"","Emma"
"2181",158,"Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was","Emma"
"2182",158,"really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. She","Emma"
"2183",158,"did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better","Emma"
"2184",158,"judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be;","Emma"
"2185",158,"but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general,","Emma"
"2186",158,"which made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him","Emma"
"2187",158,"sitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable.","Emma"
"2188",158,"Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt","Emma"
"2189",158,"on Emma’s side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He was","Emma"
"2190",158,"thinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.","Emma"
"2191",158,"","Emma"
"2192",158,"“Robert Martin has no great loss—if he can but think so; and I hope it","Emma"
"2193",158,"will not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best known","Emma"
"2194",158,"to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it","Emma"
"2195",158,"is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;—and as","Emma"
"2196",158,"a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it","Emma"
"2197",158,"will be all labour in vain.”","Emma"
"2198",158,"","Emma"
"2199",158,"Emma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,","Emma"
"2200",158,"","Emma"
"2201",158,"“Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man,","Emma"
"2202",158,"and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make","Emma"
"2203",158,"an imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as any","Emma"
"2204",158,"body. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is","Emma"
"2205",158,"as well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet’s.","Emma"
"2206",158,"He knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite","Emma"
"2207",158,"wherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved","Emma"
"2208",158,"moments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he does","Emma"
"2209",158,"not mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speak with great","Emma"
"2210",158,"animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are","Emma"
"2211",158,"intimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.”","Emma"
"2212",158,"","Emma"
"2213",158,"“I am very much obliged to you,” said Emma, laughing again. “If I had","Emma"
"2214",158,"set my heart on Mr. Elton’s marrying Harriet, it would have been very","Emma"
"2215",158,"kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to","Emma"
"2216",158,"myself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to","Emma"
"2217",158,"equal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.”","Emma"
"2218",158,"","Emma"
"2219",158,"“Good morning to you,”—said he, rising and walking off abruptly. He was","Emma"
"2220",158,"very much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was","Emma"
"2221",158,"mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he","Emma"
"2222",158,"had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the","Emma"
"2223",158,"affair, was provoking him exceedingly.","Emma"
"2224",158,"","Emma"
"2225",158,"Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more","Emma"
"2226",158,"indistinctness in the causes of her’s, than in his. She did not always","Emma"
"2227",158,"feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that","Emma"
"2228",158,"her opinions were right and her adversary’s wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He","Emma"
"2229",158,"walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. She","Emma"
"2230",158,"was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and","Emma"
"2231",158,"the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet’s","Emma"
"2232",158,"staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility","Emma"
"2233",158,"of the young man’s coming to Mrs. Goddard’s that morning, and meeting","Emma"
"2234",158,"with Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread","Emma"
"2235",158,"of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when","Emma"
"2236",158,"Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such","Emma"
"2237",158,"reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which","Emma"
"2238",158,"settled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.","Emma"
"2239",158,"Knightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which","Emma"
"2240",158,"woman’s friendship and woman’s feelings would not justify.","Emma"
"2241",158,"","Emma"
"2242",158,"He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered","Emma"
"2243",158,"that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither","Emma"
"2244",158,"with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite","Emma"
"2245",158,"of Mr. Knightley’s pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on","Emma"
"2246",158,"such a question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger,","Emma"
"2247",158,"she was able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished","Emma"
"2248",158,"resentfully to be true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly","Emma"
"2249",158,"might have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever","Emma"
"2250",158,"done, and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate","Emma"
"2251",158,"disposition as to money matters; he might naturally be rather attentive","Emma"
"2252",158,"than otherwise to them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due","Emma"
"2253",158,"allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all","Emma"
"2254",158,"interested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no such passion, and of course","Emma"
"2255",158,"thought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a","Emma"
"2256",158,"doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence","Emma"
"2257",158,"might originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree","Emma"
"2258",158,"of prudence, she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.","Emma"
"2259",158,"","Emma"
"2260",158,"Harriet’s cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not","Emma"
"2261",158,"to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been","Emma"
"2262",158,"telling her something, which she repeated immediately with great","Emma"
"2263",158,"delight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard’s to attend a sick child,","Emma"
"2264",158,"and Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was","Emma"
"2265",158,"coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and","Emma"
"2266",158,"found to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to","Emma"
"2267",158,"London, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the","Emma"
"2268",158,"whist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.","Emma"
"2269",158,"Perry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it","Emma"
"2270",158,"was in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much","Emma"
"2271",158,"to persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not","Emma"
"2272",158,"do; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a _very_","Emma"
"2273",158,"_particular_ way indeed, that he was going on business which he would","Emma"
"2274",158,"not put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very","Emma"
"2275",158,"enviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly","Emma"
"2276",158,"precious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very","Emma"
"2277",158,"sure there must be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr.","Emma"
"2278",158,"Elton only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great","Emma"
"2279",158,"spirits. Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal","Emma"
"2280",158,"more about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,","Emma"
"2281",158,"“that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be, but","Emma"
"2282",158,"she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should","Emma"
"2283",158,"think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton","Emma"
"2284",158,"had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness.”","Emma"

"2289",158,"CHAPTER IX","Emma"
"2290",158,"","Emma"
"2291",158,"","Emma"
"2292",158,"Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel with","Emma"
"2293",158,"herself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual","Emma"
"2294",158,"before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave","Emma"
"2295",158,"looks shewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could not","Emma"
"2296",158,"repent. On the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more","Emma"
"2297",158,"justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next","Emma"
"2298",158,"few days.","Emma"
"2299",158,"","Emma"
"2300",158,"The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr.","Emma"
"2301",158,"Elton’s return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common","Emma"
"2302",158,"sitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half","Emma"
"2303",158,"sentences of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet’s","Emma"
"2304",158,"feelings, they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and","Emma"
"2305",158,"steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was","Emma"
"2306",158,"soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin’s being no otherwise remembered,","Emma"
"2307",158,"than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage","Emma"
"2308",158,"to the latter.","Emma"
"2309",158,"","Emma"
"2310",158,"Her views of improving her little friend’s mind, by a great deal of","Emma"
"2311",158,"useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few","Emma"
"2312",158,"first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much","Emma"
"2313",158,"easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination","Emma"
"2314",158,"range and work at Harriet’s fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge","Emma"
"2315",158,"her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary","Emma"
"2316",158,"pursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision she","Emma"
"2317",158,"was making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing","Emma"
"2318",158,"all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thin","Emma"
"2319",158,"quarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with","Emma"
"2320",158,"ciphers and trophies.","Emma"
"2321",158,"","Emma"
"2322",158,"In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are","Emma"
"2323",158,"not uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard’s, had written","Emma"
"2324",158,"out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint","Emma"
"2325",158,"of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse’s help, to get a great many","Emma"
"2326",158,"more. Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as","Emma"
"2327",158,"Harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of","Emma"
"2328",158,"the first order, in form as well as quantity.","Emma"
"2329",158,"","Emma"
"2330",158,"Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the","Emma"
"2331",158,"girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting","Emma"
"2332",158,"in. “So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young—he","Emma"
"2333",158,"wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.”","Emma"
"2334",158,"And it always ended in “Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.”","Emma"
"2335",158,"","Emma"
"2336",158,"His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject, did","Emma"
"2337",158,"not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he had","Emma"
"2338",158,"desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much,","Emma"
"2339",158,"something, he thought, might come from that quarter.","Emma"
"2340",158,"","Emma"
"2341",158,"It was by no means his daughter’s wish that the intellects of Highbury","Emma"
"2342",158,"in general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only one","Emma"
"2343",158,"whose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any really","Emma"
"2344",158,"good enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she","Emma"
"2345",158,"had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his","Emma"
"2346",158,"recollections; and at the same time, as she could perceive, most","Emma"
"2347",158,"earnestly careful that nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe","Emma"
"2348",158,"a compliment to the sex should pass his lips. They owed to him their","Emma"
"2349",158,"two or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at","Emma"
"2350",158,"last he recalled, and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known","Emma"
"2351",158,"charade,","Emma"
"2352",158,"","Emma"
"2353",158,"My first doth affliction denote,","Emma"
"2354",158,"    Which my second is destin’d to feel","Emma"
"2355",158,"And my whole is the best antidote","Emma"
"2356",158,"    That affliction to soften and heal.—","Emma"
"2357",158,"","Emma"
"2358",158,"","Emma"
"2359",158,"made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some","Emma"
"2360",158,"pages ago already.","Emma"
"2361",158,"","Emma"
"2362",158,"“Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?” said she;","Emma"
"2363",158,"“that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be","Emma"
"2364",158,"easier to you.”","Emma"
"2365",158,"","Emma"
"2366",158,"“Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his","Emma"
"2367",158,"life. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse”—he","Emma"
"2368",158,"stopt a moment—“or Miss Smith could inspire him.”","Emma"
"2369",158,"","Emma"
"2370",158,"The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. He called","Emma"
"2371",158,"for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table","Emma"
"2372",158,"containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed","Emma"
"2373",158,"to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his","Emma"
"2374",158,"manner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.","Emma"
"2375",158,"","Emma"
"2376",158,"“I do not offer it for Miss Smith’s collection,” said he. “Being my","Emma"
"2377",158,"friend’s, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye,","Emma"
"2378",158,"but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.”","Emma"
"2379",158,"","Emma"
"2380",158,"The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could","Emma"
"2381",158,"understand. There was deep consciousness about him, and he found it","Emma"
"2382",158,"easier to meet her eye than her friend’s. He was gone the next","Emma"
"2383",158,"moment:—after another moment’s pause,","Emma"
"2384",158,"","Emma"
"2385",158,"“Take it,” said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards","Emma"
"2386",158,"Harriet—“it is for you. Take your own.”","Emma"
"2387",158,"","Emma"
"2388",158,"But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never","Emma"
"2389",158,"loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.","Emma"
"2390",158,"","Emma"
"2391",158,"To Miss——","Emma"

"2402",158,"But ah! united, what reverse we have!","Emma"
"2403",158,"    Man’s boasted power and freedom, all are flown;","Emma"

"2406",158,"","Emma"
"2407",158,"    Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,","Emma"
"2408",158,"    May its approval beam in that soft eye!","Emma"
"2409",158,"","Emma"
"2410",158,"","Emma"
"2411",158,"She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through","Emma"
"2412",158,"again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then","Emma"
"2413",158,"passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself,","Emma"
"2414",158,"while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope","Emma"
"2415",158,"and dulness, “Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worse","Emma"
"2416",158,"charades. _Courtship_—a very good hint. I give you credit for it. This","Emma"
"2417",158,"is feeling your way. This is saying very plainly—‘Pray, Miss Smith,","Emma"
"2418",158,"give me leave to pay my addresses to you. Approve my charade and my","Emma"
"2419",158,"intentions in the same glance.’","Emma"
"2420",158,"","Emma"
"2421",158,"May its approval beam in that soft eye!","Emma"

"2423",158,"","Emma"
"2424",158,"Harriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye—of all epithets, the","Emma"
"2425",158,"justest that could be given.","Emma"
"2426",158,"","Emma"
"2427",158,"Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.","Emma"
"2428",158,"","Emma"
"2429",158,"","Emma"
"2430",158,"Humph—Harriet’s ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much in","Emma"
"2431",158,"love, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had the","Emma"
"2432",158,"benefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your life","Emma"
"2433",158,"you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent charade","Emma"
"2434",158,"indeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon","Emma"
"2435",158,"now.”","Emma"
"2436",158,"","Emma"
"2437",158,"She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,","Emma"
"2438",158,"which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the","Emma"
"2439",158,"eagerness of Harriet’s wondering questions.","Emma"
"2440",158,"","Emma"
"2441",158,"“What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?—what can it be? I have not an idea—I","Emma"

"2483",158,"A very proper compliment!—and then follows the application, which I","Emma"
"2484",158,"think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in","Emma"
"2485",158,"comprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of","Emma"
"2486",158,"its being written for you and to you.”","Emma"
"2487",158,"","Emma"
"2488",158,"Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She read the","Emma"
"2489",158,"concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could not","Emma"
"2490",158,"speak. But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel.","Emma"
"2491",158,"Emma spoke for her.","Emma"
"2492",158,"","Emma"
"2493",158,"“There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,”","Emma"
"2494",158,"said she, “that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton’s intentions. You","Emma"
"2495",158,"are his object—and you will soon receive the completest proof of it. I","Emma"
"2496",158,"thought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived; but now,","Emma"
"2497",158,"it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided, as my","Emma"
"2498",158,"wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet,","Emma"
"2499",158,"just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that","Emma"
"2500",158,"has happened. I could never tell whether an attachment between you and","Emma"
"2501",158,"Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural. Its probability and its","Emma"
"2502",158,"eligibility have really so equalled each other! I am very happy. I","Emma"
"2503",158,"congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an","Emma"
"2504",158,"attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating. This is a","Emma"
"2505",158,"connexion which offers nothing but good. It will give you every thing","Emma"
"2506",158,"that you want—consideration, independence, a proper home—it will fix","Emma"
"2507",158,"you in the centre of all your real friends, close to Hartfield and to","Emma"
"2508",158,"me, and confirm our intimacy for ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance","Emma"
"2509",158,"which can never raise a blush in either of us.”","Emma"
"2510",158,"","Emma"
"2511",158,"“Dear Miss Woodhouse!”—and “Dear Miss Woodhouse,” was all that Harriet,","Emma"
"2512",158,"with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they did","Emma"
"2513",158,"arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear","Emma"
"2514",158,"to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as","Emma"
"2515",158,"she ought. Mr. Elton’s superiority had very ample acknowledgment.","Emma"
"2516",158,"","Emma"
"2517",158,"“Whatever you say is always right,” cried Harriet, “and therefore I","Emma"
"2518",158,"suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could not","Emma"
"2519",158,"have imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton,","Emma"
"2520",158,"who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about _him_. He","Emma"
"2521",158,"is so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses—‘To Miss ———.’","Emma"
"2522",158,"Dear me, how clever!—Could it really be meant for me?”","Emma"
"2523",158,"","Emma"
"2524",158,"“I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is a","Emma"
"2525",158,"certainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to the","Emma"

"2537",158,"You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one","Emma"
"2538",158,"another by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying","Emma"
"2539",158,"will be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a","Emma"
"2540",158,"something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right","Emma"

"2632",158,"as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a","Emma"
"2633",158,"declaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree","Emma"
"2634",158,"of publicity.","Emma"
"2635",158,"","Emma"

"2649",158,"quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning","Emma"
"2650",158,"which may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little","Emma"
"2651",158,"tribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not","Emma"
"2652",158,"have left the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me","Emma"
"2653",158,"than towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He has","Emma"
"2654",158,"encouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over","Emma"
"2655",158,"this charade.”","Emma"

"2658",158,"","Emma"
"2659",158,"Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the","Emma"
"2660",158,"recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of “Well, my dears, how does","Emma"
"2661",158,"your book go on?—Have you got any thing fresh?”","Emma"
"2662",158,"","Emma"
"2663",158,"“Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A","Emma"
"2664",158,"piece of paper was found on the table this morning—(dropt, we suppose,","Emma"
"2665",158,"by a fairy)—containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied","Emma"
"2666",158,"it in.”","Emma"
"2667",158,"","Emma"
"2668",158,"She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and","Emma"
"2669",158,"distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every","Emma"
"2670",158,"part as she proceeded—and he was very much pleased, and, as she had","Emma"
"2671",158,"foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.","Emma"
"2672",158,"","Emma"
"2673",158,"“Aye, that’s very just, indeed, that’s very properly said. Very true.","Emma"
"2674",158,"‘Woman, lovely woman.’ It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I can","Emma"
"2675",158,"easily guess what fairy brought it.—Nobody could have written so","Emma"
"2676",158,"prettily, but you, Emma.”","Emma"
"2677",158,"","Emma"
"2678",158,"Emma only nodded, and smiled.—After a little thinking, and a very","Emma"
"2679",158,"tender sigh, he added,","Emma"
"2680",158,"","Emma"
"2681",158,"“Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother","Emma"

"2683",158,"remember nothing;—not even that particular riddle which you have heard","Emma"

"2692",158,"","Emma"
"2693",158,"","Emma"
"2694",158,"And that is all that I can recollect of it—but it is very clever all","Emma"

"2696",158,"","Emma"
"2697",158,"“Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the","Emma"

"2709",158,"","Emma"
"2710",158,"“Oh! yes—she will have her own room, of course; the room she always","Emma"

"2730",158,"","Emma"
"2731",158,"“It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer—but it seems a case of","Emma"

"2750",158,"“Ah! papa—that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do","Emma"

"2753",158,"","Emma"
"2754",158,"This was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse","Emma"

"2772",158,"the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I","Emma"
"2773",158,"thought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They","Emma"
"2774",158,"are all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will","Emma"
"2775",158,"come and stand by my chair, and say, ‘Grandpapa, can you give me a bit","Emma"

"2786",158,"","Emma"
"2787",158,"“And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a","Emma"
"2788",158,"very frightful way!”","Emma"
"2789",158,"","Emma"
"2790",158,"“But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such","Emma"
"2791",158,"enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of","Emma"
"2792",158,"their taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.”","Emma"
"2793",158,"","Emma"
"2794",158,"“Well, I cannot understand it.”","Emma"
"2795",158,"","Emma"
"2796",158,"“That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot","Emma"
"2797",158,"understand the pleasures of the other.”","Emma"
"2798",158,"","Emma"
"2799",158,"Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in","Emma"
"2800",158,"preparation for the regular four o’clock dinner, the hero of this","Emma"
"2801",158,"inimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could","Emma"
"2802",158,"receive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in","Emma"
"2803",158,"his the consciousness of having made a push—of having thrown a die; and","Emma"
"2804",158,"she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His ostensible","Emma"
"2805",158,"reason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse’s party could be made","Emma"
"2806",158,"up in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest","Emma"
"2807",158,"degree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give","Emma"
"2808",158,"way; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his","Emma"
"2809",158,"dining with him—had made such a point of it, that he had promised him","Emma"
"2810",158,"conditionally to come.","Emma"
"2811",158,"","Emma"
"2812",158,"Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend","Emma"
"2813",158,"on their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged—she","Emma"
"2814",158,"re-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the","Emma"
"2815",158,"paper from the table, she returned it—","Emma"
"2816",158,"","Emma"
"2817",158,"“Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;","Emma"
"2818",158,"thank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have","Emma"
"2819",158,"ventured to write it into Miss Smith’s collection. Your friend will not","Emma"
"2820",158,"take it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first","Emma"
"2821",158,"eight lines.”","Emma"
"2822",158,"","Emma"
"2823",158,"Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked","Emma"
"2824",158,"rather doubtingly—rather confused; said something about","Emma"
"2825",158,"“honour,”—glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open","Emma"
"2826",158,"on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively. With the","Emma"
"2827",158,"view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,","Emma"
"2828",158,"","Emma"
"2829",158,"“You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must","Emma"
"2830",158,"not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman’s","Emma"
"2831",158,"approbation while he writes with such gallantry.”","Emma"
"2832",158,"","Emma"
"2833",158,"“I have no hesitation in saying,” replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating","Emma"
"2834",158,"a good deal while he spoke; “I have no hesitation in saying—at least if","Emma"
"2835",158,"my friend feels at all as _I_ do—I have not the smallest doubt that,","Emma"
"2836",158,"could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it, (looking at","Emma"
"2837",158,"the book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as","Emma"
"2838",158,"the proudest moment of his life.”","Emma"
"2839",158,"","Emma"
"2840",158,"After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think","Emma"
"2841",158,"it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a","Emma"
"2842",158,"sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to","Emma"
"2843",158,"laugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and","Emma"
"2844",158,"the sublime of pleasure to Harriet’s share.","Emma"

"2849",158,"CHAPTER X","Emma"
"2850",158,"","Emma"
"2851",158,"","Emma"
"2852",158,"Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to","Emma"
"2853",158,"prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the","Emma"
"2854",158,"morrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who","Emma"
"2855",158,"lived a little way out of Highbury.","Emma"
"2856",158,"","Emma"
"2857",158,"Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane","Emma"
"2858",158,"leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street","Emma"
"2859",158,"of the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of","Emma"
"2860",158,"Mr. Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then,","Emma"
"2861",158,"about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and","Emma"
"2862",158,"not very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had","Emma"
"2863",158,"no advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the","Emma"
"2864",158,"present proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility","Emma"
"2865",158,"of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing","Emma"
"2866",158,"eyes.—Emma’s remark was—","Emma"
"2867",158,"","Emma"
"2868",158,"“There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these","Emma"
"2869",158,"days.”—Harriet’s was—","Emma"
"2870",158,"","Emma"
"2871",158,"“Oh, what a sweet house!—How very beautiful!—There are the yellow","Emma"
"2872",158,"curtains that Miss Nash admires so much.”","Emma"
"2873",158,"","Emma"
"2874",158,"“I do not often walk this way _now_,” said Emma, as they proceeded,","Emma"
"2875",158,"“but _then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get","Emma"
"2876",158,"intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of","Emma"
"2877",158,"this part of Highbury.”","Emma"
"2878",158,"","Emma"
"2879",158,"Harriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage, and","Emma"
"2880",158,"her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and","Emma"
"2881",158,"probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with Mr.","Emma"
"2882",158,"Elton’s seeing ready wit in her.","Emma"
"2883",158,"","Emma"
"2884",158,"“I wish we could contrive it,” said she; “but I cannot think of any","Emma"
"2885",158,"tolerable pretence for going in;—no servant that I want to inquire","Emma"
"2886",158,"about of his housekeeper—no message from my father.”","Emma"
"2887",158,"","Emma"
"2888",158,"She pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of","Emma"
"2889",158,"some minutes, Harriet thus began again—","Emma"
"2890",158,"","Emma"
"2891",158,"“I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or","Emma"
"2892",158,"going to be married! so charming as you are!”—","Emma"
"2893",158,"","Emma"
"2894",158,"Emma laughed, and replied,","Emma"
"2895",158,"","Emma"
"2896",158,"“My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;","Emma"
"2897",158,"I must find other people charming—one other person at least. And I am","Emma"
"2898",158,"not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little","Emma"
"2899",158,"intention of ever marrying at all.”","Emma"
"2900",158,"","Emma"
"2901",158,"“Ah!—so you say; but I cannot believe it.”","Emma"
"2902",158,"","Emma"
"2903",158,"“I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be","Emma"
"2904",158,"tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the","Emma"
"2905",158,"question: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person. I would rather","Emma"
"2906",158,"not be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to","Emma"
"2907",158,"marry, I must expect to repent it.”","Emma"
"2908",158,"","Emma"
"2909",158,"“Dear me!—it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!”—","Emma"
"2910",158,"","Emma"
"2911",158,"“I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall","Emma"
"2912",158,"in love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been","Emma"
"2913",158,"in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever","Emma"
"2914",158,"shall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a","Emma"
"2915",158,"situation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;","Emma"
"2916",158,"consequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much","Emma"
"2917",158,"mistress of their husband’s house as I am of Hartfield; and never,","Emma"
"2918",158,"never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always","Emma"
"2919",158,"first and always right in any man’s eyes as I am in my father’s.”","Emma"
"2920",158,"","Emma"
"2921",158,"“But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!”","Emma"
"2922",158,"","Emma"
"2923",158,"“That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I","Emma"
"2924",158,"thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly—so satisfied—so","Emma"
"2925",158,"smiling—so prosing—so undistinguishing and unfastidious—and so apt to","Emma"
"2926",158,"tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry","Emma"
"2927",158,"to-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never can be any","Emma"
"2928",158,"likeness, except in being unmarried.”","Emma"
"2929",158,"","Emma"
"2930",158,"“But still, you will be an old maid! and that’s so dreadful!”","Emma"
"2931",158,"","Emma"
"2932",158,"“Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty","Emma"
"2933",158,"only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single","Emma"
"2934",158,"woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable","Emma"
"2935",158,"old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of","Emma"
"2936",158,"good fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and","Emma"
"2937",158,"pleasant as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much","Emma"
"2938",158,"against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first;","Emma"
"2939",158,"for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour","Emma"
"2940",158,"the temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very","Emma"
"2941",158,"small, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and","Emma"
"2942",158,"cross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too","Emma"
"2943",158,"good natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very","Emma"
"2944",158,"much to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty","Emma"
"2945",158,"certainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had","Emma"
"2946",158,"only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away","Emma"
"2947",158,"sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm.”","Emma"
"2948",158,"","Emma"
"2949",158,"“Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you","Emma"
"2950",158,"grow old?”","Emma"
"2951",158,"","Emma"
"2952",158,"“If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great","Emma"
"2953",158,"many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more","Emma"
"2954",158,"in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman’s","Emma"
"2955",158,"usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they","Emma"
"2956",158,"are now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read","Emma"
"2957",158,"more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for","Emma"
"2958",158,"objects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the","Emma"
"2959",158,"great point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil","Emma"
"2960",158,"to be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the","Emma"
"2961",158,"children of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be","Emma"
"2962",158,"enough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation","Emma"
"2963",158,"that declining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and","Emma"
"2964",158,"every fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a","Emma"
"2965",158,"parent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and","Emma"
"2966",158,"blinder. My nephews and nieces!—I shall often have a niece with me.”","Emma"
"2967",158,"","Emma"
"2968",158,"“Do you know Miss Bates’s niece? That is, I know you must have seen her","Emma"
"2969",158,"a hundred times—but are you acquainted?”","Emma"
"2970",158,"","Emma"
"2971",158,"“Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to","Emma"
"2972",158,"Highbury. By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit","Emma"
"2973",158,"with a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people","Emma"
"2974",158,"half so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane","Emma"
"2975",158,"Fairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter","Emma"
"2976",158,"from her is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go","Emma"
"2977",158,"round and round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of","Emma"
"2978",158,"a stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears","Emma"
"2979",158,"of nothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she","Emma"
"2980",158,"tires me to death.”","Emma"
"2981",158,"","Emma"
"2982",158,"They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were","Emma"
"2983",158,"superseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor","Emma"
"2984",158,"were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her","Emma"
"2985",158,"counsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,","Emma"
"2986",158,"could allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic","Emma"
"2987",158,"expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had","Emma"
"2988",158,"done so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and","Emma"
"2989",158,"always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In","Emma"
"2990",158,"the present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she","Emma"
"2991",158,"came to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give","Emma"
"2992",158,"comfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of","Emma"
"2993",158,"the scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,","Emma"
"2994",158,"","Emma"
"2995",158,"“These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make","Emma"
"2996",158,"every thing else appear!—I feel now as if I could think of nothing but","Emma"
"2997",158,"these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how","Emma"
"2998",158,"soon it may all vanish from my mind?”","Emma"
"2999",158,"","Emma"
"3000",158,"“Very true,” said Harriet. “Poor creatures! one can think of nothing","Emma"
"3001",158,"else.”","Emma"
"3002",158,"","Emma"
"3003",158,"“And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,” said","Emma"
"3004",158,"Emma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended","Emma"
"3005",158,"the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them","Emma"
"3006",158,"into the lane again. “I do not think it will,” stopping to look once","Emma"
"3007",158,"more at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still","Emma"
"3008",158,"greater within.","Emma"
"3009",158,"","Emma"
"3010",158,"“Oh! dear, no,” said her companion.","Emma"
"3011",158,"","Emma"
"3012",158,"They walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was","Emma"
"3013",158,"passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma","Emma"
"3014",158,"time only to say farther,","Emma"
"3015",158,"","Emma"
"3016",158,"“Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good","Emma"
"3017",158,"thoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion","Emma"
"3018",158,"has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that","Emma"
"3019",158,"is truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we","Emma"
"3020",158,"can for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to","Emma"
"3021",158,"ourselves.”","Emma"
"3022",158,"","Emma"
"3023",158,"Harriet could just answer, “Oh! dear, yes,” before the gentleman joined","Emma"
"3024",158,"them. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the","Emma"
"3025",158,"first subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. His visit","Emma"
"3026",158,"he would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about what","Emma"
"3027",158,"could be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to","Emma"
"3028",158,"accompany them.","Emma"
"3029",158,"","Emma"
"3030",158,"“To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,” thought Emma;","Emma"
"3031",158,"“to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase of","Emma"
"3032",158,"love on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the","Emma"
"3033",158,"declaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.”","Emma"
"3034",158,"","Emma"
"3035",158,"Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon","Emma"
"3036",158,"afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one","Emma"
"3037",158,"side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had","Emma"
"3038",158,"not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet’s habits of","Emma"
"3039",158,"dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,","Emma"
"3040",158,"they would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately","Emma"
"3041",158,"stopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing","Emma"
"3042",158,"of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the","Emma"
"3043",158,"footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would","Emma"
"3044",158,"follow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time","Emma"
"3045",158,"she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the","Emma"
"3046",158,"comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from","Emma"
"3047",158,"the cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to","Emma"
"3048",158,"fetch broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk","Emma"
"3049",158,"to and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would","Emma"
"3050",158,"have been the most natural, had she been acting just then without","Emma"
"3051",158,"design; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead,","Emma"
"3052",158,"without any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,","Emma"
"3053",158,"involuntarily: the child’s pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; and","Emma"
"3054",158,"she was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in a","Emma"
"3055",158,"conversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with","Emma"
"3056",158,"animation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,","Emma"
"3057",158,"having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw","Emma"
"3058",158,"back a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged","Emma"
"3059",158,"to join them.","Emma"
"3060",158,"","Emma"
"3061",158,"Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;","Emma"
"3062",158,"and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was","Emma"
"3063",158,"only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday’s party at","Emma"
"3064",158,"his friend Cole’s, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton","Emma"
"3065",158,"cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and","Emma"
"3066",158,"all the dessert.","Emma"
"3067",158,"","Emma"
"3068",158,"“This would soon have led to something better, of course,” was her","Emma"
"3069",158,"consoling reflection; “any thing interests between those who love; and","Emma"
"3070",158,"any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I","Emma"
"3071",158,"could but have kept longer away!”","Emma"
"3072",158,"","Emma"
"3073",158,"They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage","Emma"
"3074",158,"pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the","Emma"
"3075",158,"house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,","Emma"
"3076",158,"and fall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off","Emma"
"3077",158,"short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged","Emma"
"3078",158,"to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself","Emma"
"3079",158,"to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.","Emma"
"3080",158,"","Emma"
"3081",158,"“Part of my lace is gone,” said she, “and I do not know how I am to","Emma"
"3082",158,"contrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I","Emma"
"3083",158,"hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to","Emma"
"3084",158,"stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or","Emma"
"3085",158,"string, or any thing just to keep my boot on.”","Emma"
"3086",158,"","Emma"
"3087",158,"Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could","Emma"
"3088",158,"exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house","Emma"
"3089",158,"and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they","Emma"
"3090",158,"were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards;","Emma"
"3091",158,"behind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door","Emma"
"3092",158,"between them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to","Emma"
"3093",158,"receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged","Emma"
"3094",158,"to leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr.","Emma"
"3095",158,"Elton should close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained","Emma"
"3096",158,"ajar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she","Emma"
"3097",158,"hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the","Emma"
"3098",158,"adjoining room. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It","Emma"
"3099",158,"could be protracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and","Emma"
"3100",158,"make her appearance.","Emma"

"3103",158,"favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of","Emma"
"3104",158,"having schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to","Emma"
"3105",158,"the point. He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told","Emma"
"3106",158,"Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them;","Emma"
"3107",158,"other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing","Emma"
"3108",158,"serious.","Emma"
"3109",158,"","Emma"
"3110",158,"“Cautious, very cautious,” thought Emma; “he advances inch by inch, and","Emma"

"3122",158,"","Emma"
"3123",158,"","Emma"
"3124",158,"Mr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma’s power","Emma"
"3125",158,"to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming of her","Emma"
"3126",158,"sister’s family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation,","Emma"
"3127",158,"and then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest;","Emma"
"3128",158,"and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be","Emma"
"3129",158,"expected—she did not herself expect—that any thing beyond occasional,","Emma"
"3130",158,"fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers. They","Emma"
"3131",158,"might advance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow","Emma"
"3132",158,"or other whether they would or no. She hardly wished to have more","Emma"
"3133",158,"leisure for them. There are people, who the more you do for them, the","Emma"
"3134",158,"less they will do for themselves.","Emma"
"3135",158,"","Emma"
"3136",158,"Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent","Emma"
"3137",158,"from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual","Emma"
"3138",158,"interest. Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had","Emma"
"3139",158,"been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays","Emma"
"3140",158,"of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it","Emma"
"3141",158,"was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by","Emma"
"3142",158,"their Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not","Emma"
"3143",158,"be induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella’s sake; and","Emma"
"3144",158,"who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in","Emma"
"3145",158,"forestalling this too short visit.","Emma"
"3146",158,"","Emma"
"3147",158,"He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little","Emma"
"3148",158,"of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some","Emma"
"3149",158,"of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless;","Emma"
"3150",158,"the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John","Emma"
"3151",158,"Knightley, their five children, and a competent number of","Emma"
"3152",158,"nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of","Emma"
"3153",158,"such an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and","Emma"
"3154",158,"variously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion","Emma"
"3155",158,"which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor have","Emma"
"3156",158,"endured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the","Emma"
"3157",158,"feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that","Emma"
"3158",158,"in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her","Emma"
"3159",158,"little ones, and for their having instantly all the liberty and","Emma"
"3160",158,"attendance, all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing,","Emma"
"3161",158,"which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay, the","Emma"
"3162",158,"children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him, either in","Emma"
"3163",158,"themselves or in any restless attendance on them.","Emma"
"3164",158,"","Emma"
"3165",158,"Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,","Emma"
"3166",158,"quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate;","Emma"
"3167",158,"wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so","Emma"
"3168",158,"tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher","Emma"
"3169",158,"ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never see a","Emma"
"3170",158,"fault in any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding or","Emma"
"3171",158,"any quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited","Emma"
"3172",158,"also much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health,","Emma"
"3173",158,"over-careful of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves,","Emma"
"3174",158,"and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be","Emma"
"3175",158,"of Mr. Perry. They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper,","Emma"
"3176",158,"and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance.","Emma"
"3177",158,"","Emma"
"3178",158,"Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;","Emma"
"3179",158,"rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private","Emma"
"3180",158,"character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being","Emma"
"3181",158,"generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. He","Emma"
"3182",158,"was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to","Emma"
"3183",158,"deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection;","Emma"
"3184",158,"and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that","Emma"
"3185",158,"any natural defects in it should not be increased. The extreme","Emma"
"3186",158,"sweetness of her temper must hurt his. He had all the clearness and","Emma"
"3187",158,"quickness of mind which she wanted, and he could sometimes act an","Emma"
"3188",158,"ungracious, or say a severe thing.","Emma"
"3189",158,"","Emma"
"3190",158,"He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong","Emma"
"3191",158,"in him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries to","Emma"
"3192",158,"Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might have","Emma"
"3193",158,"passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella’s sister,","Emma"
"3194",158,"but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without","Emma"
"3195",158,"praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal","Emma"
"3196",158,"compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all","Emma"
"3197",158,"in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful","Emma"
"3198",158,"forbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patience","Emma"
"3199",158,"that could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse’s peculiarities and","Emma"
"3200",158,"fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or","Emma"
"3201",158,"sharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr.","Emma"
"3202",158,"John Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and","Emma"
"3203",158,"generally a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often","Emma"
"3204",158,"for Emma’s charity, especially as there was all the pain of","Emma"
"3205",158,"apprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not. The","Emma"
"3206",158,"beginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properest","Emma"
"3207",158,"feelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass","Emma"
"3208",158,"away in unsullied cordiality. They had not been long seated and","Emma"
"3209",158,"composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a","Emma"
"3210",158,"sigh, called his daughter’s attention to the sad change at Hartfield","Emma"
"3211",158,"since she had been there last.","Emma"
"3212",158,"","Emma"
"3213",158,"“Ah, my dear,” said he, “poor Miss Taylor—It is a grievous business.”","Emma"
"3214",158,"","Emma"
"3215",158,"“Oh yes, sir,” cried she with ready sympathy, “how you must miss her!","Emma"
"3216",158,"And dear Emma, too!—What a dreadful loss to you both!—I have been so","Emma"
"3217",158,"grieved for you.—I could not imagine how you could possibly do without","Emma"
"3218",158,"her.—It is a sad change indeed.—But I hope she is pretty well, sir.”","Emma"
"3219",158,"","Emma"
"3220",158,"“Pretty well, my dear—I hope—pretty well.—I do not know but that the","Emma"
"3221",158,"place agrees with her tolerably.”","Emma"
"3222",158,"","Emma"
"3223",158,"Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any","Emma"
"3224",158,"doubts of the air of Randalls.","Emma"
"3225",158,"","Emma"
"3226",158,"“Oh! no—none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my","Emma"
"3227",158,"life—never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret.”","Emma"
"3228",158,"","Emma"
"3229",158,"“Very much to the honour of both,” was the handsome reply.","Emma"
"3230",158,"","Emma"
"3231",158,"“And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?” asked Isabella in the","Emma"
"3232",158,"plaintive tone which just suited her father.","Emma"
"3233",158,"","Emma"
"3234",158,"Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.—“Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.”","Emma"
"3235",158,"","Emma"
"3236",158,"“Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they","Emma"
"3237",158,"married. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one,","Emma"
"3238",158,"have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both,","Emma"
"3239",158,"either at Randalls or here—and as you may suppose, Isabella, most","Emma"
"3240",158,"frequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston","Emma"
"3241",158,"is really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy","Emma"
"3242",158,"way, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body","Emma"
"3243",158,"must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought","Emma"
"3244",158,"also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our","Emma"
"3245",158,"missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated—which","Emma"
"3246",158,"is the exact truth.”","Emma"
"3247",158,"","Emma"
"3248",158,"“Just as it should be,” said Mr. John Knightley, “and just as I hoped","Emma"
"3249",158,"it was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention could not","Emma"
"3250",158,"be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all","Emma"
"3251",158,"easy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of","Emma"
"3252",158,"the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and","Emma"
"3253",158,"now you have Emma’s account, I hope you will be satisfied.”","Emma"
"3254",158,"","Emma"
"3255",158,"“Why, to be sure,” said Mr. Woodhouse—“yes, certainly—I cannot deny","Emma"
"3256",158,"that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty","Emma"
"3257",158,"often—but then—she is always obliged to go away again.”","Emma"
"3258",158,"","Emma"
"3259",158,"“It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.—You quite","Emma"
"3260",158,"forget poor Mr. Weston.”","Emma"
"3261",158,"","Emma"
"3262",158,"“I think, indeed,” said John Knightley pleasantly, “that Mr. Weston has","Emma"
"3263",158,"some little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of","Emma"
"3264",158,"the poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the","Emma"
"3265",158,"claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for","Emma"
"3266",158,"Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience of","Emma"
"3267",158,"putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.”","Emma"
"3268",158,"","Emma"
"3269",158,"“Me, my love,” cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.—","Emma"
"3270",158,"“Are you talking about me?—I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a","Emma"
"3271",158,"greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for","Emma"
"3272",158,"the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of","Emma"
"3273",158,"Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to","Emma"
"3274",158,"slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is","Emma"
"3275",158,"nothing he does not deserve. I believe he is one of the very","Emma"
"3276",158,"best-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself and your","Emma"
"3277",158,"brother, I do not know his equal for temper. I shall never forget his","Emma"
"3278",158,"flying Henry’s kite for him that very windy day last Easter—and ever","Emma"
"3279",158,"since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing","Emma"
"3280",158,"that note, at twelve o’clock at night, on purpose to assure me that","Emma"
"3281",158,"there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could","Emma"
"3282",158,"not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.—If any body","Emma"
"3283",158,"can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.”","Emma"
"3284",158,"","Emma"
"3285",158,"“Where is the young man?” said John Knightley. “Has he been here on","Emma"
"3286",158,"this occasion—or has he not?”","Emma"
"3287",158,"","Emma"
"3288",158,"“He has not been here yet,” replied Emma. “There was a strong","Emma"
"3289",158,"expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in","Emma"
"3290",158,"nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.”","Emma"
"3291",158,"","Emma"
"3292",158,"“But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,” said her father. “He","Emma"
"3293",158,"wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very","Emma"
"3294",158,"proper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very","Emma"
"3295",158,"well done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one","Emma"
"3296",158,"cannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps—”","Emma"
"3297",158,"","Emma"
"3298",158,"“My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.”","Emma"
"3299",158,"","Emma"
"3300",158,"“Three-and-twenty!—is he indeed?—Well, I could not have thought it—and","Emma"
"3301",158,"he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well, time does","Emma"
"3302",158,"fly indeed!—and my memory is very bad. However, it was an exceeding","Emma"
"3303",158,"good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of","Emma"
"3304",158,"pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.","Emma"
"3305",158,"28th—and began, ‘My dear Madam,’ but I forget how it went on; and it","Emma"
"3306",158,"was signed ‘F. C. Weston Churchill.’—I remember that perfectly.”","Emma"
"3307",158,"","Emma"
"3308",158,"“How very pleasing and proper of him!” cried the good-hearted Mrs. John","Emma"
"3309",158,"Knightley. “I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. But","Emma"
"3310",158,"how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! There is","Emma"
"3311",158,"something so shocking in a child’s being taken away from his parents","Emma"
"3312",158,"and natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part","Emma"
"3313",158,"with him. To give up one’s child! I really never could think well of","Emma"
"3314",158,"any body who proposed such a thing to any body else.”","Emma"
"3315",158,"","Emma"
"3316",158,"“Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,” observed Mr.","Emma"
"3317",158,"John Knightley coolly. “But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have","Emma"
"3318",158,"felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is","Emma"
"3319",158,"rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings;","Emma"
"3320",158,"he takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow","Emma"
"3321",158,"or other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society","Emma"
"3322",158,"for his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and","Emma"
"3323",158,"playing whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family","Emma"
"3324",158,"affection, or any thing that home affords.”","Emma"
"3325",158,"","Emma"
"3326",158,"Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and","Emma"
"3327",158,"had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. She","Emma"
"3328",158,"would keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable","Emma"
"3329",158,"and valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home","Emma"
"3330",158,"to himself, whence resulted her brother’s disposition to look down on","Emma"
"3331",158,"the common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was","Emma"
"3332",158,"important.—It had a high claim to forbearance.","Emma"

"3343",158,"besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had","Emma"
"3344",158,"particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement","Emma"

"3350",158,"in the wrong, and _he_ would never own that he had. Concession must be","Emma"
"3351",158,"out of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had","Emma"
"3352",158,"ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration","Emma"
"3353",158,"of friendship, that when he came into the room she had one of the","Emma"
"3354",158,"children with her—the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months","Emma"
"3355",158,"old, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to","Emma"
"3356",158,"be danced about in her aunt’s arms. It did assist; for though he began","Emma"
"3357",158,"with grave looks and short questions, he was soon led on to talk of","Emma"
"3358",158,"them all in the usual way, and to take the child out of her arms with","Emma"
"3359",158,"all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends","Emma"
"3360",158,"again; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and","Emma"

"3392",158,"Emma, that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing","Emma"
"3393",158,"old grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.”","Emma"
"3394",158,"","Emma"
"3395",158,"“That’s true,” she cried—“very true. Little Emma, grow up a better","Emma"
"3396",158,"woman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.","Emma"
"3397",158,"Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as good","Emma"
"3398",158,"intentions went, we were _both_ right, and I must say that no effects","Emma"
"3399",158,"on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want to know","Emma"
"3400",158,"that Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.”","Emma"
"3401",158,"","Emma"
"3402",158,"“A man cannot be more so,” was his short, full answer.","Emma"
"3403",158,"","Emma"
"3404",158,"“Ah!—Indeed I am very sorry.—Come, shake hands with me.”","Emma"
"3405",158,"","Emma"
"3406",158,"This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John","Emma"
"3407",158,"Knightley made his appearance, and “How d’ye do, George?” and “John,","Emma"
"3408",158,"how are you?” succeeded in the true English style, burying under a","Emma"
"3409",158,"calmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment which","Emma"
"3410",158,"would have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the","Emma"
"3411",158,"good of the other.","Emma"
"3412",158,"","Emma"
"3413",158,"The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards","Emma"
"3414",158,"entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, and","Emma"
"3415",158,"the little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his","Emma"
"3416",158,"daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally","Emma"
"3417",158,"distinct, or very rarely mixing—and Emma only occasionally joining in","Emma"
"3418",158,"one or the other.","Emma"
"3419",158,"","Emma"
"3420",158,"The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally","Emma"
"3421",158,"of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,","Emma"
"3422",158,"and who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate, he had","Emma"
"3423",158,"generally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some","Emma"
"3424",158,"curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the","Emma"
"3425",158,"home-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next","Emma"
"3426",158,"year, and to give all such local information as could not fail of being","Emma"
"3427",158,"interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest","Emma"
"3428",158,"part of his life, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of a","Emma"
"3429",158,"drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the","Emma"
"3430",158,"destination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was","Emma"
"3431",158,"entered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his cooler","Emma"
"3432",158,"manners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever left him any","Emma"
"3433",158,"thing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached a tone of","Emma"
"3434",158,"eagerness.","Emma"
"3435",158,"","Emma"
"3436",158,"While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a","Emma"
"3437",158,"full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.","Emma"
"3438",158,"","Emma"
"3439",158,"“My poor dear Isabella,” said he, fondly taking her hand, and","Emma"
"3440",158,"interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her","Emma"
"3441",158,"five children—“How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!","Emma"
"3442",158,"And how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early,","Emma"
"3443",158,"my dear—and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.—You and I","Emma"
"3444",158,"will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we all","Emma"
"3445",158,"have a little gruel.”","Emma"
"3446",158,"","Emma"
"3447",158,"Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both","Emma"
"3448",158,"the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as","Emma"
"3449",158,"herself;—and two basins only were ordered. After a little more","Emma"
"3450",158,"discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not being","Emma"
"3451",158,"taken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say, with an air of","Emma"
"3452",158,"grave reflection,","Emma"
"3453",158,"","Emma"
"3454",158,"“It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South","Emma"
"3455",158,"End instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air.”","Emma"
"3456",158,"","Emma"
"3457",158,"“Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir—or we should not","Emma"
"3458",158,"have gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly for","Emma"
"3459",158,"the weakness in little Bella’s throat,—both sea air and bathing.”","Emma"
"3460",158,"","Emma"
"3461",158,"“Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any","Emma"
"3462",158,"good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though","Emma"
"3463",158,"perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use","Emma"
"3464",158,"to any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.”","Emma"
"3465",158,"","Emma"
"3466",158,"“Come, come,” cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, “I must","Emma"
"3467",158,"beg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;—I","Emma"
"3468",158,"who have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear","Emma"
"3469",158,"Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet;","Emma"
"3470",158,"and he never forgets you.”","Emma"
"3471",158,"","Emma"
"3472",158,"“Oh! good Mr. Perry—how is he, sir?”","Emma"
"3473",158,"","Emma"
"3474",158,"“Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and he","Emma"
"3475",158,"has not time to take care of himself—he tells me he has not time to","Emma"
"3476",158,"take care of himself—which is very sad—but he is always wanted all","Emma"
"3477",158,"round the country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice","Emma"
"3478",158,"anywhere. But then there is not so clever a man any where.”","Emma"
"3479",158,"","Emma"
"3480",158,"“And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow? I","Emma"
"3481",158,"have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling soon. He","Emma"
"3482",158,"will be so pleased to see my little ones.”","Emma"
"3483",158,"","Emma"
"3484",158,"“I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask","Emma"
"3485",158,"him about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes,","Emma"
"3486",158,"you had better let him look at little Bella’s throat.”","Emma"
"3487",158,"","Emma"
"3488",158,"“Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any","Emma"
"3489",158,"uneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to","Emma"
"3490",158,"her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr.","Emma"
"3491",158,"Wingfield’s, which we have been applying at times ever since August.”","Emma"
"3492",158,"","Emma"
"3493",158,"“It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use","Emma"
"3494",158,"to her—and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have","Emma"
"3495",158,"spoken to—","Emma"
"3496",158,"","Emma"
"3497",158,"“You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,” said Emma, “I","Emma"
"3498",158,"have not heard one inquiry after them.”","Emma"
"3499",158,"","Emma"
"3500",158,"“Oh! the good Bateses—I am quite ashamed of myself—but you mention them","Emma"
"3501",158,"in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs.","Emma"
"3502",158,"Bates—I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.—They are","Emma"
"3503",158,"always so pleased to see my children.—And that excellent Miss","Emma"
"3504",158,"Bates!—such thorough worthy people!—How are they, sir?”","Emma"
"3505",158,"","Emma"
"3506",158,"“Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a","Emma"
"3507",158,"bad cold about a month ago.”","Emma"
"3508",158,"","Emma"
"3509",158,"“How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been","Emma"
"3510",158,"this autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more","Emma"
"3511",158,"general or heavy—except when it has been quite an influenza.”","Emma"
"3512",158,"","Emma"
"3513",158,"“That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you","Emma"
"3514",158,"mention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy","Emma"
"3515",158,"as he has very often known them in November. Perry does not call it","Emma"
"3516",158,"altogether a sickly season.”","Emma"
"3517",158,"","Emma"
"3518",158,"“No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly","Emma"
"3519",158,"except—","Emma"
"3520",158,"","Emma"
"3521",158,"“Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always a","Emma"
"3522",158,"sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a","Emma"
"3523",158,"dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!—and the","Emma"
"3524",158,"air so bad!”","Emma"
"3525",158,"","Emma"
"3526",158,"“No, indeed—_we_ are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London is","Emma"
"3527",158,"very superior to most others!—You must not confound us with London in","Emma"
"3528",158,"general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very","Emma"
"3529",158,"different from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be","Emma"
"3530",158,"unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;—there is","Emma"
"3531",158,"hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in: but","Emma"
"3532",158,"_we_ are so remarkably airy!—Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of","Emma"
"3533",158,"Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.”","Emma"
"3534",158,"","Emma"
"3535",158,"“Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it—but","Emma"
"3536",158,"after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different","Emma"
"3537",158,"creatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I","Emma"
"3538",158,"think you are any of you looking well at present.”","Emma"
"3539",158,"","Emma"
"3540",158,"“I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those","Emma"
"3541",158,"little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely","Emma"
"3542",158,"free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were","Emma"
"3543",158,"rather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a","Emma"
"3544",158,"little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of","Emma"
"3545",158,"coming. I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I","Emma"
"3546",158,"assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had ever","Emma"
"3547",158,"sent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust, at least, that you","Emma"
"3548",158,"do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,” turning her eyes with","Emma"
"3549",158,"affectionate anxiety towards her husband.","Emma"
"3550",158,"","Emma"
"3551",158,"“Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley","Emma"
"3552",158,"very far from looking well.”","Emma"
"3553",158,"","Emma"
"3554",158,"“What is the matter, sir?—Did you speak to me?” cried Mr. John","Emma"
"3555",158,"Knightley, hearing his own name.","Emma"
"3556",158,"","Emma"
"3557",158,"“I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking","Emma"
"3558",158,"well—but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have","Emma"
"3559",158,"wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before","Emma"
"3560",158,"you left home.”","Emma"
"3561",158,"","Emma"
"3562",158,"“My dear Isabella,”—exclaimed he hastily—“pray do not concern yourself","Emma"
"3563",158,"about my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and","Emma"
"3564",158,"the children, and let me look as I chuse.”","Emma"
"3565",158,"","Emma"
"3566",158,"“I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,”","Emma"
"3567",158,"cried Emma, “about your friend Mr. Graham’s intending to have a bailiff","Emma"
"3568",158,"from Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will it answer? Will","Emma"
"3569",158,"not the old prejudice be too strong?”","Emma"
"3570",158,"","Emma"
"3571",158,"And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced","Emma"
"3572",158,"to give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing","Emma"
"3573",158,"worse to hear than Isabella’s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane","Emma"
"3574",158,"Fairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that","Emma"
"3575",158,"moment very happy to assist in praising.","Emma"
"3576",158,"","Emma"
"3577",158,"“That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!” said Mrs. John Knightley.—“It is so","Emma"
"3578",158,"long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment","Emma"
"3579",158,"accidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good old","Emma"
"3580",158,"grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always","Emma"
"3581",158,"regret excessively on dear Emma’s account that she cannot be more at","Emma"
"3582",158,"Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.","Emma"
"3583",158,"Campbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a","Emma"
"3584",158,"delightful companion for Emma.”","Emma"
"3585",158,"","Emma"
"3586",158,"Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,","Emma"
"3587",158,"","Emma"
"3588",158,"“Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty","Emma"
"3589",158,"kind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a","Emma"
"3590",158,"better companion than Harriet.”","Emma"
"3591",158,"","Emma"
"3592",158,"“I am most happy to hear it—but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so","Emma"
"3593",158,"very accomplished and superior!—and exactly Emma’s age.”","Emma"
"3594",158,"","Emma"
"3595",158,"This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar","Emma"
"3596",158,"moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not","Emma"
"3597",158,"close without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied","Emma"
"3598",158,"a great deal to be said—much praise and many comments—undoubting","Emma"
"3599",158,"decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe","Emma"
"3600",158,"Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with","Emma"
"3601",158,"tolerably;—but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter","Emma"
"3602",158,"had to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in","Emma"
"3603",158,"her own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never","Emma"
"3604",158,"had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth","Emma"
"3605",158,"gruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered","Emma"
"3606",158,"it, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a","Emma"
"3607",158,"dangerous opening.","Emma"
"3608",158,"","Emma"
"3609",158,"“Ah!” said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her","Emma"
"3610",158,"with tender concern.—The ejaculation in Emma’s ear expressed, “Ah!","Emma"
"3611",158,"there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It","Emma"
"3612",158,"does not bear talking of.” And for a little while she hoped he would","Emma"
"3613",158,"not talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore","Emma"
"3614",158,"him to the relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some","Emma"
"3615",158,"minutes, however, he began with,","Emma"
"3616",158,"","Emma"
"3617",158,"“I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,","Emma"
"3618",158,"instead of coming here.”","Emma"
"3619",158,"","Emma"
"3620",158,"“But why should you be sorry, sir?—I assure you, it did the children a","Emma"
"3621",158,"great deal of good.”","Emma"
"3622",158,"","Emma"
"3623",158,"“And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been","Emma"
"3624",158,"to South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to","Emma"
"3625",158,"hear you had fixed upon South End.”","Emma"
"3626",158,"","Emma"
"3627",158,"“I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite","Emma"
"3628",158,"a mistake, sir.—We all had our health perfectly well there, never found","Emma"
"3629",158,"the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is","Emma"
"3630",158,"entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may","Emma"
"3631",158,"be depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air,","Emma"
"3632",158,"and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly.”","Emma"
"3633",158,"","Emma"
"3634",158,"“You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.—Perry","Emma"
"3635",158,"was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the","Emma"
"3636",158,"sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And,","Emma"
"3637",158,"by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from","Emma"
"3638",158,"the sea—a quarter of a mile off—very comfortable. You should have","Emma"
"3639",158,"consulted Perry.”","Emma"
"3640",158,"","Emma"
"3641",158,"“But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;—only consider how","Emma"
"3642",158,"great it would have been.—An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.”","Emma"
"3643",158,"","Emma"
"3644",158,"“Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else","Emma"
"3645",158,"should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to","Emma"
"3646",158,"chuse between forty miles and an hundred.—Better not move at all,","Emma"
"3647",158,"better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a","Emma"
"3648",158,"worse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a very","Emma"
"3649",158,"ill-judged measure.”","Emma"
"3650",158,"","Emma"
"3651",158,"Emma’s attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had","Emma"
"3652",158,"reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her","Emma"
"3653",158,"brother-in-law’s breaking out.","Emma"
"3654",158,"","Emma"
"3655",158,"“Mr. Perry,” said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, “would do","Emma"
"3656",158,"as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it","Emma"
"3657",158,"any business of his, to wonder at what I do?—at my taking my family to","Emma"
"3658",158,"one part of the coast or another?—I may be allowed, I hope, the use of","Emma"
"3659",158,"my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.—I want his directions no more than","Emma"
"3660",158,"his drugs.” He paused—and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only","Emma"
"3661",158,"sarcastic dryness, “If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and","Emma"
"3662",158,"five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater","Emma"
"3663",158,"expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as","Emma"
"3664",158,"willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.”","Emma"
"3665",158,"","Emma"
"3666",158,"“True, true,” cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition—“very","Emma"
"3667",158,"true. That’s a consideration indeed.—But John, as to what I was telling","Emma"
"3668",158,"you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to the","Emma"
"3669",158,"right that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot conceive","Emma"
"3670",158,"any difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of","Emma"
"3671",158,"inconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly","Emma"
"3672",158,"the present line of the path.... The only way of proving it, however,","Emma"
"3673",158,"will be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow","Emma"
"3674",158,"morning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me","Emma"
"3675",158,"your opinion.”","Emma"
"3676",158,"","Emma"
"3677",158,"Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his","Emma"

"3697",158,"In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their","Emma"
"3698",158,"mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,","Emma"
"3699",158,"there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no","Emma"
"3700",158,"denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;—even Mr. Woodhouse was","Emma"
"3701",158,"persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of","Emma"
"3702",158,"the party.","Emma"
"3703",158,"","Emma"
"3704",158,"How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he","Emma"
"3705",158,"could, but as his son and daughter’s carriage and horses were actually","Emma"
"3706",158,"at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on","Emma"
"3707",158,"that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long","Emma"
"3708",158,"to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for","Emma"
"3709",158,"Harriet also.","Emma"
"3710",158,"","Emma"
"3711",158,"Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the","Emma"
"3712",158,"only persons invited to meet them;—the hours were to be early, as well","Emma"
"3713",158,"as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse’s habits and inclination being","Emma"
"3714",158,"consulted in every thing.","Emma"
"3715",158,"","Emma"
"3716",158,"The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that","Emma"
"3717",158,"Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent","Emma"
"3718",158,"by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with","Emma"
"3719",158,"a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs.","Emma"
"3720",158,"Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emma","Emma"
"3721",158,"called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed with","Emma"
"3722",158,"regard to Randalls. She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat:","Emma"
"3723",158,"Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of,","Emma"
"3724",158,"and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which","Emma"
"3725",158,"excluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not","Emma"
"3726",158,"speak of her loss without many tears.","Emma"
"3727",158,"","Emma"
"3728",158,"Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard’s","Emma"
"3729",158,"unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much","Emma"
"3730",158,"Mr. Elton’s would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at","Emma"
"3731",158,"last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a","Emma"
"3732",158,"most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. She had","Emma"
"3733",158,"not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard’s door, when she was met by","Emma"
"3734",158,"Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on","Emma"
"3735",158,"slowly together in conversation about the invalid—of whom he, on the","Emma"
"3736",158,"rumour of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he","Emma"
"3737",158,"might carry some report of her to Hartfield—they were overtaken by Mr.","Emma"
"3738",158,"John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two","Emma"
"3739",158,"eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a","Emma"
"3740",158,"country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton","Emma"
"3741",158,"and rice pudding they were hastening home for. They joined company and","Emma"
"3742",158,"proceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend’s","Emma"
"3743",158,"complaint;—“a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat","Emma"
"3744",158,"about her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs.","Emma"
"3745",158,"Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often","Emma"
"3746",158,"alarmed her with them.” Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as","Emma"
"3747",158,"he exclaimed,","Emma"
"3748",158,"","Emma"
"3749",158,"“A sore-throat!—I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid","Emma"
"3750",158,"infectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of","Emma"
"3751",158,"yourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.","Emma"
"3752",158,"Why does not Perry see her?”","Emma"
"3753",158,"","Emma"
"3754",158,"Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this","Emma"
"3755",158,"excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard’s experience and","Emma"
"3756",158,"care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she","Emma"
"3757",158,"could not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist","Emma"
"3758",158,"than not, she added soon afterwards—as if quite another subject,","Emma"
"3759",158,"","Emma"
"3760",158,"“It is so cold, so very cold—and looks and feels so very much like","Emma"
"3761",158,"snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I","Emma"
"3762",158,"should really try not to go out to-day—and dissuade my father from","Emma"
"3763",158,"venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel","Emma"
"3764",158,"the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so","Emma"
"3765",158,"great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr.","Emma"
"3766",158,"Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me","Emma"
"3767",158,"a little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and","Emma"
"3768",158,"what fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than","Emma"
"3769",158,"common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.”","Emma"
"3770",158,"","Emma"
"3771",158,"Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;","Emma"
"3772",158,"which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind","Emma"
"3773",158,"care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her’s,","Emma"
"3774",158,"he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;—but Emma,","Emma"
"3775",158,"too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear","Emma"
"3776",158,"him impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied","Emma"
"3777",158,"with his muttering acknowledgment of its being “very cold, certainly","Emma"
"3778",158,"very cold,” and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from","Emma"
"3779",158,"Randalls, and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet","Emma"
"3780",158,"every hour of the evening.","Emma"
"3781",158,"","Emma"
"3782",158,"“You do quite right,” said she;—“we will make your apologies to Mr. and","Emma"
"3783",158,"Mrs. Weston.”","Emma"
"3784",158,"","Emma"
"3785",158,"But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly","Emma"
"3786",158,"offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton’s only","Emma"
"3787",158,"objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt","Emma"
"3788",158,"satisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had","Emma"
"3789",158,"his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment;","Emma"
"3790",158,"never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when","Emma"
"3791",158,"he next looked at her.","Emma"
"3792",158,"","Emma"
"3793",158,"“Well,” said she to herself, “this is most strange!—After I had got him","Emma"
"3794",158,"off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill","Emma"
"3795",158,"behind!—Most strange indeed!—But there is, I believe, in many men,","Emma"
"3796",158,"especially single men, such an inclination—such a passion for dining","Emma"
"3797",158,"out—a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,","Emma"
"3798",158,"their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thing","Emma"
"3799",158,"gives way to it—and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most","Emma"
"3800",158,"valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in","Emma"
"3801",158,"love with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must","Emma"
"3802",158,"dine out wherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can see","Emma"
"3803",158,"ready wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her.”","Emma"
"3804",158,"","Emma"
"3805",158,"Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him","Emma"
"3806",158,"the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his","Emma"
"3807",158,"manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while","Emma"
"3808",158,"assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard’s for news of her fair","Emma"
"3809",158,"friend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting","Emma"
"3810",158,"her again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and he","Emma"
"3811",158,"sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of","Emma"
"3812",158,"approbation much in his favour.","Emma"
"3813",158,"","Emma"
"3814",158,"After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley","Emma"
"3815",158,"began with—","Emma"
"3816",158,"","Emma"
"3817",158,"“I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr.","Emma"
"3818",158,"Elton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With","Emma"
"3819",158,"men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to","Emma"
"3820",158,"please, every feature works.”","Emma"
"3821",158,"","Emma"
"3822",158,"“Mr. Elton’s manners are not perfect,” replied Emma; “but where there","Emma"
"3823",158,"is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a","Emma"
"3824",158,"great deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he","Emma"
"3825",158,"will have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such","Emma"
"3826",158,"perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but","Emma"
"3827",158,"value.”","Emma"
"3828",158,"","Emma"
"3829",158,"“Yes,” said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, “he seems","Emma"
"3830",158,"to have a great deal of good-will towards you.”","Emma"
"3831",158,"","Emma"
"3832",158,"“Me!” she replied with a smile of astonishment, “are you imagining me","Emma"
"3833",158,"to be Mr. Elton’s object?”","Emma"
"3834",158,"","Emma"
"3835",158,"“Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never","Emma"
"3836",158,"occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration","Emma"
"3837",158,"now.”","Emma"
"3838",158,"","Emma"
"3839",158,"“Mr. Elton in love with me!—What an idea!”","Emma"
"3840",158,"","Emma"
"3841",158,"“I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is","Emma"
"3842",158,"so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your","Emma"
"3843",158,"manners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better","Emma"
"3844",158,"look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.”","Emma"
"3845",158,"","Emma"
"3846",158,"“I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and I","Emma"
"3847",158,"are very good friends, and nothing more;” and she walked on, amusing","Emma"
"3848",158,"herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a","Emma"
"3849",158,"partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of","Emma"
"3850",158,"high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very","Emma"
"3851",158,"well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and","Emma"
"3852",158,"in want of counsel. He said no more.","Emma"
"3853",158,"","Emma"
"3854",158,"Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in","Emma"
"3855",158,"spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of","Emma"
"3856",158,"shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his","Emma"
"3857",158,"eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness","Emma"
"3858",158,"of the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his","Emma"
"3859",158,"own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it","Emma"
"3860",158,"was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was","Emma"
"3861",158,"severe; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes","Emma"
"3862",158,"of snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of","Emma"
"3863",158,"being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very","Emma"
"3864",158,"white world in a very short time.","Emma"
"3865",158,"","Emma"
"3866",158,"Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The","Emma"
"3867",158,"preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of","Emma"
"3868",158,"his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,","Emma"
"3869",158,"which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated","Emma"
"3870",158,"nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the","Emma"
"3871",158,"whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his","Emma"
"3872",158,"discontent.","Emma"
"3873",158,"","Emma"
"3874",158,"“A man,” said he, “must have a very good opinion of himself when he","Emma"
"3875",158,"asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as","Emma"
"3876",158,"this, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most","Emma"
"3877",158,"agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest","Emma"
"3878",158,"absurdity—Actually snowing at this moment!—The folly of not allowing","Emma"
"3879",158,"people to be comfortable at home—and the folly of people’s not staying","Emma"
"3880",158,"comfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such an","Emma"
"3881",158,"evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we","Emma"
"3882",158,"should deem it;—and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing","Emma"
"3883",158,"than usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of","Emma"
"3884",158,"the voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view","Emma"
"3885",158,"or his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter","Emma"
"3886",158,"that he can;—here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in","Emma"
"3887",158,"another man’s house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said","Emma"
"3888",158,"and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.","Emma"
"3889",158,"Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;—four horses and","Emma"
"3890",158,"four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering","Emma"
"3891",158,"creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had","Emma"
"3892",158,"at home.”","Emma"
"3893",158,"","Emma"
"3894",158,"Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no","Emma"
"3895",158,"doubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the “Very true, my","Emma"
"3896",158,"love,” which must have been usually administered by his travelling","Emma"
"3897",158,"companion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any","Emma"
"3898",158,"answer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded being","Emma"
"3899",158,"quarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed him to","Emma"
"3900",158,"talk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening","Emma"
"3901",158,"her lips.","Emma"
"3902",158,"","Emma"
"3903",158,"They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr.","Emma"
"3904",158,"Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma","Emma"
"3905",158,"thought with pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all","Emma"
"3906",158,"obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities","Emma"
"3907",158,"indeed, that she began to think he must have received a different","Emma"
"3908",158,"account of Harriet from what had reached her. She had sent while","Emma"
"3909",158,"dressing, and the answer had been, “Much the same—not better.”","Emma"
"3910",158,"","Emma"
"3911",158,"“_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard’s,” said she presently, “was not so","Emma"
"3912",158,"pleasant as I had hoped—‘Not better’ was _my_ answer.”","Emma"
"3913",158,"","Emma"
"3914",158,"His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of","Emma"
"3915",158,"sentiment as he answered.","Emma"
"3916",158,"","Emma"
"3917",158,"“Oh! no—I am grieved to find—I was on the point of telling you that","Emma"
"3918",158,"when I called at Mrs. Goddard’s door, which I did the very last thing","Emma"
"3919",158,"before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,","Emma"
"3920",158,"by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned—I had","Emma"
"3921",158,"flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew","Emma"
"3922",158,"had been given her in the morning.”","Emma"
"3923",158,"","Emma"
"3924",158,"Emma smiled and answered—“My visit was of use to the nervous part of","Emma"
"3925",158,"her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it","Emma"
"3926",158,"is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you","Emma"
"3927",158,"probably heard.”","Emma"
"3928",158,"","Emma"
"3929",158,"“Yes—I imagined—that is—I did not—”","Emma"
"3930",158,"","Emma"
"3931",158,"“He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow","Emma"
"3932",158,"morning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is","Emma"
"3933",158,"impossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party","Emma"
"3934",158,"to-day!”","Emma"
"3935",158,"","Emma"
"3936",158,"“Dreadful!—Exactly so, indeed.—She will be missed every moment.”","Emma"
"3937",158,"","Emma"
"3938",158,"This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really","Emma"
"3939",158,"estimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay","Emma"
"3940",158,"when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,","Emma"
"3941",158,"and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.","Emma"
"3942",158,"","Emma"
"3943",158,"“What an excellent device,” said he, “the use of a sheepskin for","Emma"
"3944",158,"carriages. How very comfortable they make it;—impossible to feel cold","Emma"
"3945",158,"with such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have","Emma"
"3946",158,"rendered a gentleman’s carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced","Emma"
"3947",158,"and guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way","Emma"
"3948",158,"unpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very","Emma"
"3949",158,"cold afternoon—but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.—Ha!","Emma"
"3950",158,"snows a little I see.”","Emma"
"3951",158,"","Emma"
"3952",158,"“Yes,” said John Knightley, “and I think we shall have a good deal of","Emma"
"3953",158,"it.”","Emma"
"3954",158,"","Emma"
"3955",158,"“Christmas weather,” observed Mr. Elton. “Quite seasonable; and","Emma"
"3956",158,"extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin","Emma"
"3957",158,"yesterday, and prevent this day’s party, which it might very possibly","Emma"
"3958",158,"have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been","Emma"
"3959",158,"much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite","Emma"
"3960",158,"the season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body","Emma"
"3961",158,"invites their friends about them, and people think little of even the","Emma"
"3962",158,"worst weather. I was snowed up at a friend’s house once for a week.","Emma"
"3963",158,"Nothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not","Emma"
"3964",158,"get away till that very day se’nnight.”","Emma"
"3965",158,"","Emma"
"3966",158,"Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but","Emma"
"3967",158,"said only, coolly,","Emma"
"3968",158,"","Emma"
"3969",158,"“I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.”","Emma"
"3970",158,"","Emma"
"3971",158,"At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much","Emma"
"3972",158,"astonished now at Mr. Elton’s spirits for other feelings. Harriet","Emma"
"3973",158,"seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.","Emma"
"3974",158,"","Emma"
"3975",158,"“We are sure of excellent fires,” continued he, “and every thing in the","Emma"
"3976",158,"greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;—Mrs. Weston","Emma"
"3977",158,"indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so","Emma"
"3978",158,"hospitable, and so fond of society;—it will be a small party, but where","Emma"
"3979",158,"small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.","Emma"
"3980",158,"Mr. Weston’s dining-room does not accommodate more than ten","Emma"
"3981",158,"comfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances,","Emma"
"3982",158,"fall short by two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me,","Emma"
"3983",158,"(turning with a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your","Emma"
"3984",158,"approbation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large","Emma"
"3985",158,"parties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings.”","Emma"
"3986",158,"","Emma"
"3987",158,"“I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir—I never dine with","Emma"
"3988",158,"any body.”","Emma"
"3989",158,"","Emma"
"3990",158,"“Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law had","Emma"
"3991",158,"been so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will be","Emma"
"3992",158,"paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great","Emma"
"3993",158,"enjoyment.”","Emma"
"3994",158,"","Emma"
"3995",158,"“My first enjoyment,” replied John Knightley, as they passed through","Emma"
"3996",158,"the sweep-gate, “will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.”","Emma"

"4002",158,"","Emma"
"4003",158,"","Emma"
"4004",158,"Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they","Emma"
"4005",158,"walked into Mrs. Weston’s drawing-room;—Mr. Elton must compose his","Emma"
"4006",158,"joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr. Elton","Emma"
"4007",158,"must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the","Emma"
"4008",158,"place.—Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as","Emma"
"4009",158,"happy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.","Emma"
"4010",158,"Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the","Emma"
"4011",158,"world to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any","Emma"
"4012",158,"one, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and","Emma"
"4013",158,"understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the","Emma"
"4014",158,"little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father","Emma"
"4015",158,"and herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston","Emma"
"4016",158,"had not a lively concern; and half an hour’s uninterrupted","Emma"
"4017",158,"communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness","Emma"
"4018",158,"of private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.","Emma"
"4019",158,"","Emma"
"4020",158,"This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day’s visit might not","Emma"
"4021",158,"afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but","Emma"
"4022",158,"the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was","Emma"
"4023",158,"grateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of","Emma"
"4024",158,"Mr. Elton’s oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all","Emma"
"4025",158,"that was enjoyable to the utmost.","Emma"
"4026",158,"","Emma"
"4027",158,"The misfortune of Harriet’s cold had been pretty well gone through","Emma"
"4028",158,"before her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to","Emma"
"4029",158,"give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and","Emma"
"4030",158,"Isabella’s coming, and of Emma’s being to follow, and had indeed just","Emma"
"4031",158,"got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his","Emma"
"4032",158,"daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been","Emma"
"4033",158,"almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away","Emma"
"4034",158,"and welcome her dear Emma.","Emma"
"4035",158,"","Emma"
"4036",158,"Emma’s project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather","Emma"
"4037",158,"sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close","Emma"
"4038",158,"to her. The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility","Emma"
"4039",158,"towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but","Emma"
"4040",158,"was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and","Emma"
"4041",158,"solicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting","Emma"
"4042",158,"him, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal","Emma"
"4043",158,"suggestion of “Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be","Emma"
"4044",158,"possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from","Emma"
"4045",158,"Harriet to me?—Absurd and insufferable!”—Yet he would be so anxious for","Emma"
"4046",158,"her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father, and","Emma"
"4047",158,"so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her","Emma"
"4048",158,"drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly","Emma"
"4049",158,"like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her","Emma"
"4050",158,"good manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for","Emma"
"4051",158,"Harriet’s, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even","Emma"
"4052",158,"positively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was","Emma"
"4053",158,"going on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr.","Emma"
"4054",158,"Elton’s nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard","Emma"
"4055",158,"enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his","Emma"
"4056",158,"son; she heard the words “my son,” and “Frank,” and “my son,” repeated","Emma"
"4057",158,"several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much","Emma"
"4058",158,"suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but","Emma"
"4059",158,"before she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past","Emma"
"4060",158,"that any reviving question from her would have been awkward.","Emma"
"4061",158,"","Emma"
"4062",158,"Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma’s resolution of never","Emma"
"4063",158,"marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank","Emma"
"4064",158,"Churchill, which always interested her. She had frequently","Emma"
"4065",158,"thought—especially since his father’s marriage with Miss Taylor—that if","Emma"
"4066",158,"she _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,","Emma"
"4067",158,"character and condition. He seemed by this connexion between the","Emma"
"4068",158,"families, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be a","Emma"
"4069",158,"match that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.","Emma"
"4070",158,"Weston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not","Emma"
"4071",158,"meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a","Emma"
"4072",158,"situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could","Emma"
"4073",158,"change it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided","Emma"
"4074",158,"intention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain","Emma"
"4075",158,"degree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in","Emma"
"4076",158,"their friends’ imaginations.","Emma"
"4077",158,"","Emma"
"4078",158,"With such sensations, Mr. Elton’s civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;","Emma"
"4079",158,"but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very","Emma"
"4080",158,"cross—and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly","Emma"
"4081",158,"pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the","Emma"
"4082",158,"substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.—So it proved;—for","Emma"
"4083",158,"when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at","Emma"
"4084",158,"dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of","Emma"
"4085",158,"hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say","Emma"
"4086",158,"to her,","Emma"
"4087",158,"","Emma"
"4088",158,"“We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to","Emma"
"4089",158,"see two more here,—your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my","Emma"
"4090",158,"son—and then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not","Emma"
"4091",158,"hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting","Emma"
"4092",158,"Frank. I had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us","Emma"
"4093",158,"within a fortnight.”","Emma"
"4094",158,"","Emma"
"4095",158,"Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to","Emma"
"4096",158,"his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their","Emma"
"4097",158,"party quite complete.","Emma"
"4098",158,"","Emma"
"4099",158,"“He has been wanting to come to us,” continued Mr. Weston, “ever since","Emma"
"4100",158,"September: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his","Emma"
"4101",158,"own time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between","Emma"
"4102",158,"ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.","Emma"
"4103",158,"But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in","Emma"
"4104",158,"January.”","Emma"
"4105",158,"","Emma"
"4106",158,"“What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so","Emma"
"4107",158,"anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as","Emma"
"4108",158,"yourself.”","Emma"
"4109",158,"","Emma"
"4110",158,"“Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.","Emma"
"4111",158,"She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not","Emma"
"4112",158,"know the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is—(but this is","Emma"
"4113",158,"quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the","Emma"
"4114",158,"other room. There are secrets in all families, you know)—The case is,","Emma"
"4115",158,"that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in","Emma"
"4116",158,"January; and that Frank’s coming depends upon their being put off. If","Emma"
"4117",158,"they are not put off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it","Emma"
"4118",158,"is a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has","Emma"
"4119",158,"a particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite","Emma"
"4120",158,"them once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes","Emma"
"4121",158,"to the point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as","Emma"
"4122",158,"confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of","Emma"
"4123",158,"being here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the","Emma"
"4124",158,"upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so","Emma"
"4125",158,"little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their","Emma"
"4126",158,"effects, as I have been long in the practice of doing.”","Emma"
"4127",158,"","Emma"
"4128",158,"“I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,” replied","Emma"
"4129",158,"Emma; “but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think he","Emma"
"4130",158,"will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.”","Emma"
"4131",158,"","Emma"
"4132",158,"“Yes—I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at","Emma"
"4133",158,"the place in my life.—She is an odd woman!—But I never allow myself to","Emma"
"4134",158,"speak ill of her, on Frank’s account; for I do believe her to be very","Emma"
"4135",158,"fond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any","Emma"
"4136",158,"body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her","Emma"
"4137",158,"way—allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing","Emma"
"4138",158,"to be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him,","Emma"
"4139",158,"that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it","Emma"
"4140",158,"to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in","Emma"
"4141",158,"general; and the devil of a temper.”","Emma"
"4142",158,"","Emma"
"4143",158,"Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,","Emma"
"4144",158,"very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy—yet","Emma"
"4145",158,"observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.—","Emma"
"4146",158,"Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be","Emma"
"4147",158,"secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked","Emma"
"4148",158,"of: “for I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as","Emma"
"4149",158,"Mr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr.","Emma"
"4150",158,"Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter","Emma"
"4151",158,"stands?”","Emma"
"4152",158,"","Emma"
"4153",158,"“Yes—it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.","Emma"
"4154",158,"Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.”","Emma"
"4155",158,"","Emma"
"4156",158,"“My Emma!” replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, “what is the certainty of","Emma"
"4157",158,"caprice?” Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending","Emma"
"4158",158,"before—“You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means","Emma"
"4159",158,"so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father","Emma"
"4160",158,"thinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt’s spirits and pleasure; in","Emma"
"4161",158,"short, upon her temper. To you—to my two daughters—I may venture on the","Emma"
"4162",158,"truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered","Emma"
"4163",158,"woman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare","Emma"
"4164",158,"him.”","Emma"
"4165",158,"","Emma"
"4166",158,"“Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,” replied","Emma"
"4167",158,"Isabella: “and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without","Emma"
"4168",158,"the greatest compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered","Emma"
"4169",158,"person, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any","Emma"
"4170",158,"thing of; but it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she","Emma"
"4171",158,"never had any children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would","Emma"
"4172",158,"have made them!”","Emma"
"4173",158,"","Emma"
"4174",158,"Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then have","Emma"
"4175",158,"heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve","Emma"
"4176",158,"which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,","Emma"
"4177",158,"would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from","Emma"
"4178",158,"her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own","Emma"
"4179",158,"imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. But at","Emma"
"4180",158,"present there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon","Emma"
"4181",158,"followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after dinner,","Emma"
"4182",158,"was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine nor","Emma"
"4183",158,"conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with","Emma"
"4184",158,"whom he was always comfortable.","Emma"
"4185",158,"","Emma"
"4186",158,"While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of","Emma"
"4187",158,"saying,","Emma"
"4188",158,"","Emma"
"4189",158,"“And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means","Emma"
"4190",158,"certain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,","Emma"
"4191",158,"whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.”","Emma"
"4192",158,"","Emma"
"4193",158,"“Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even","Emma"
"4194",158,"if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that","Emma"
"4195",158,"some excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine","Emma"
"4196",158,"any reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the","Emma"
"4197",158,"Churchills’ to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They are","Emma"
"4198",158,"jealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no","Emma"
"4199",158,"dependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.”","Emma"
"4200",158,"","Emma"
"4201",158,"“He ought to come,” said Emma. “If he could stay only a couple of days,","Emma"
"4202",158,"he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man’s not having","Emma"
"4203",158,"it in his power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she fall","Emma"
"4204",158,"into bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she","Emma"
"4205",158,"wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_’s being under","Emma"
"4206",158,"such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if","Emma"
"4207",158,"he likes it.”","Emma"
"4208",158,"","Emma"
"4209",158,"“One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before","Emma"
"4210",158,"one decides upon what he can do,” replied Mrs. Weston. “One ought to","Emma"
"4211",158,"use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one","Emma"
"4212",158,"individual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must","Emma"
"4213",158,"not be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and","Emma"
"4214",158,"every thing gives way to her.”","Emma"
"4215",158,"","Emma"
"4216",158,"“But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite.","Emma"
"4217",158,"Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,","Emma"
"4218",158,"that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to","Emma"
"4219",158,"whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice","Emma"
"4220",158,"towards _him_, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom","Emma"
"4221",158,"she owes nothing at all.”","Emma"
"4222",158,"","Emma"
"4223",158,"“My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand","Emma"
"4224",158,"a bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way.","Emma"
"4225",158,"I have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it","Emma"
"4226",158,"may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will","Emma"
"4227",158,"be.”","Emma"
"4228",158,"","Emma"
"4229",158,"Emma listened, and then coolly said, “I shall not be satisfied, unless","Emma"
"4230",158,"he comes.”","Emma"
"4231",158,"","Emma"
"4232",158,"“He may have a great deal of influence on some points,” continued Mrs.","Emma"
"4233",158,"Weston, “and on others, very little: and among those, on which she is","Emma"
"4234",158,"beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance","Emma"
"4235",158,"of his coming away from them to visit us.”","Emma"

"4240",158,"CHAPTER XV","Emma"
"4241",158,"","Emma"
"4242",158,"","Emma"
"4243",158,"Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his tea","Emma"
"4244",158,"he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three","Emma"
"4245",158,"companions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of","Emma"
"4246",158,"the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty","Emma"
"4247",158,"and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at","Emma"
"4248",158,"last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in","Emma"
"4249",158,"very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and","Emma"
"4250",158,"Emma were sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and,","Emma"
"4251",158,"with scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.","Emma"
"4252",158,"","Emma"
"4253",158,"Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by the","Emma"
"4254",158,"expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late","Emma"
"4255",158,"improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his","Emma"
"4256",158,"making Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most","Emma"
"4257",158,"friendly smiles.","Emma"
"4258",158,"","Emma"
"4259",158,"He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend—her fair,","Emma"
"4260",158,"lovely, amiable friend. “Did she know?—had she heard any thing about","Emma"
"4261",158,"her, since their being at Randalls?—he felt much anxiety—he must","Emma"
"4262",158,"confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.” And","Emma"
"4263",158,"in this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much","Emma"
"4264",158,"attending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the","Emma"
"4265",158,"terror of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.","Emma"
"4266",158,"","Emma"
"4267",158,"But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if","Emma"
"4268",158,"he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than","Emma"
"4269",158,"on Harriet’s—more anxious that she should escape the infection, than","Emma"
"4270",158,"that there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with great","Emma"
"4271",158,"earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber","Emma"
"4272",158,"again, for the present—to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture","Emma"
"4273",158,"into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; and","Emma"
"4274",158,"though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its","Emma"
"4275",158,"proper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude","Emma"
"4276",158,"about her. She was vexed. It did appear—there was no concealing","Emma"
"4277",158,"it—exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of","Emma"
"4278",158,"Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!","Emma"
"4279",158,"and she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turned to Mrs.","Emma"
"4280",158,"Weston to implore her assistance, “Would not she give him her","Emma"
"4281",158,"support?—would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss","Emma"
"4282",158,"Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard’s till it were certain that Miss","Emma"
"4283",158,"Smith’s disorder had no infection? He could not be satisfied without a","Emma"
"4284",158,"promise—would not she give him her influence in procuring it?”","Emma"
"4285",158,"","Emma"
"4286",158,"“So scrupulous for others,” he continued, “and yet so careless for","Emma"
"4287",158,"herself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and","Emma"
"4288",158,"yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore","Emma"
"4289",158,"throat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?—Judge between us. Have not I","Emma"
"4290",158,"some right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.”","Emma"
"4291",158,"","Emma"
"4292",158,"Emma saw Mrs. Weston’s surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an","Emma"
"4293",158,"address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right","Emma"
"4294",158,"of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked","Emma"
"4295",158,"and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the","Emma"
"4296",158,"purpose. She could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she","Emma"
"4297",158,"thought must restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa,","Emma"
"4298",158,"removing to a seat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.","Emma"
"4299",158,"","Emma"
"4300",158,"She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did","Emma"
"4301",158,"another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room","Emma"
"4302",158,"from examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information","Emma"
"4303",158,"of the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast,","Emma"
"4304",158,"with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr.","Emma"
"4305",158,"Woodhouse:","Emma"
"4306",158,"","Emma"
"4307",158,"“This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir.","Emma"
"4308",158,"Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way","Emma"
"4309",158,"through a storm of snow.”","Emma"
"4310",158,"","Emma"
"4311",158,"Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else","Emma"
"4312",158,"had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,","Emma"
"4313",158,"and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston and","Emma"
"4314",158,"Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his","Emma"
"4315",158,"son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.","Emma"
"4316",158,"","Emma"
"4317",158,"“I admired your resolution very much, sir,” said he, “in venturing out","Emma"
"4318",158,"in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.","Emma"
"4319",158,"Every body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit;","Emma"
"4320",158,"and I dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two’s snow","Emma"
"4321",158,"can hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one","Emma"
"4322",158,"is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the","Emma"
"4323",158,"other at hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before","Emma"
"4324",158,"midnight.”","Emma"
"4325",158,"","Emma"
"4326",158,"Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he","Emma"
"4327",158,"had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it","Emma"
"4328",158,"should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his","Emma"
"4329",158,"hurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely","Emma"
"4330",158,"to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid","Emma"
"4331",158,"they would find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable,","Emma"
"4332",158,"that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost","Emma"
"4333",158,"good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,","Emma"
"4334",158,"calling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,","Emma"
"4335",158,"every body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the","Emma"
"4336",158,"consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.","Emma"
"4337",158,"","Emma"
"4338",158,"“What is to be done, my dear Emma?—what is to be done?” was Mr.","Emma"
"4339",158,"Woodhouse’s first exclamation, and all that he could say for some time.","Emma"
"4340",158,"To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her","Emma"
"4341",158,"representation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of","Emma"
"4342",158,"their having so many friends about them, revived him a little.","Emma"
"4343",158,"","Emma"
"4344",158,"His eldest daughter’s alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being","Emma"
"4345",158,"blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full","Emma"
"4346",158,"in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for","Emma"
"4347",158,"adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was","Emma"
"4348",158,"eager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at","Emma"
"4349",158,"Randalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through all","Emma"
"4350",158,"the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.","Emma"
"4351",158,"","Emma"
"4352",158,"“You had better order the carriage directly, my love,” said she; “I","Emma"
"4353",158,"dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if","Emma"
"4354",158,"we do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at","Emma"
"4355",158,"all afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my","Emma"
"4356",158,"shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing","Emma"
"4357",158,"that gives me cold.”","Emma"
"4358",158,"","Emma"
"4359",158,"“Indeed!” replied he. “Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most","Emma"
"4360",158,"extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing","Emma"
"4361",158,"does give you cold. Walk home!—you are prettily shod for walking home,","Emma"
"4362",158,"I dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.”","Emma"
"4363",158,"","Emma"
"4364",158,"Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.","Emma"
"4365",158,"Weston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could","Emma"
"4366",158,"not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;","Emma"
"4367",158,"and they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had","Emma"
"4368",158,"left the room immediately after his brother’s first report of the snow,","Emma"
"4369",158,"came back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to","Emma"
"4370",158,"examine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty","Emma"
"4371",158,"in their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour","Emma"
"4372",158,"hence. He had gone beyond the sweep—some way along the Highbury","Emma"
"4373",158,"road—the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep—in many places hardly","Emma"
"4374",158,"enough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present,","Emma"
"4375",158,"but the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its","Emma"
"4376",158,"being soon over. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with","Emma"
"4377",158,"him in there being nothing to apprehend.","Emma"
"4378",158,"","Emma"
"4379",158,"To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were","Emma"
"4380",158,"scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father’s account, who was","Emma"
"4381",158,"immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous","Emma"
"4382",158,"constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be","Emma"
"4383",158,"appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at","Emma"
"4384",158,"Randalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in","Emma"
"4385",158,"returning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe","Emma"
"4386",158,"to stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,","Emma"
"4387",158,"Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus—","Emma"
"4388",158,"","Emma"
"4389",158,"“Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?”","Emma"
"4390",158,"","Emma"
"4391",158,"“I am ready, if the others are.”","Emma"
"4392",158,"","Emma"
"4393",158,"“Shall I ring the bell?”","Emma"
"4394",158,"","Emma"
"4395",158,"“Yes, do.”","Emma"
"4396",158,"","Emma"
"4397",158,"And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes","Emma"
"4398",158,"more, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his","Emma"
"4399",158,"own house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and","Emma"
"4400",158,"happiness when this visit of hardship were over.","Emma"
"4401",158,"","Emma"
"4402",158,"The carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such","Emma"
"4403",158,"occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr.","Emma"
"4404",158,"Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of","Emma"
"4405",158,"alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the","Emma"
"4406",158,"discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for. “He was","Emma"
"4407",158,"afraid they should have a very bad drive. He was afraid poor Isabella","Emma"
"4408",158,"would not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.","Emma"
"4409",158,"He did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much together","Emma"
"4410",158,"as they could;” and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very","Emma"
"4411",158,"slow and wait for the other carriage.","Emma"
"4412",158,"","Emma"
"4413",158,"Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he","Emma"
"4414",158,"did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;","Emma"
"4415",158,"so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second","Emma"
"4416",158,"carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,","Emma"
"4417",158,"and that they were to have a tête-à-tête drive. It would not have been","Emma"
"4418",158,"the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,","Emma"
"4419",158,"previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to","Emma"
"4420",158,"him of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but","Emma"
"4421",158,"one. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She believed he had","Emma"
"4422",158,"been drinking too much of Mr. Weston’s good wine, and felt sure that he","Emma"
"4423",158,"would want to be talking nonsense.","Emma"
"4424",158,"","Emma"
"4425",158,"To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was","Emma"
"4426",158,"immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of","Emma"
"4427",158,"the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had","Emma"
"4428",158,"they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she","Emma"
"4429",158,"found her subject cut up—her hand seized—her attention demanded, and","Emma"
"4430",158,"Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the","Emma"
"4431",158,"precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well","Emma"
"4432",158,"known, hoping—fearing—adoring—ready to die if she refused him; but","Emma"
"4433",158,"flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and","Emma"
"4434",158,"unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,","Emma"
"4435",158,"very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It","Emma"
"4436",158,"really was so. Without scruple—without apology—without much apparent","Emma"
"4437",158,"diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself","Emma"
"4438",158,"_her_ lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say","Emma"
"4439",158,"it all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to","Emma"
"4440",158,"restrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly must","Emma"
"4441",158,"be drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to","Emma"
"4442",158,"the passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the","Emma"
"4443",158,"playful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she","Emma"
"4444",158,"replied,","Emma"
"4445",158,"","Emma"
"4446",158,"“I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to _me_! you forget","Emma"
"4447",158,"yourself—you take me for my friend—any message to Miss Smith I shall be","Emma"
"4448",158,"happy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.”","Emma"
"4449",158,"","Emma"
"4450",158,"“Miss Smith!—message to Miss Smith!—What could she possibly mean!”—And","Emma"
"4451",158,"he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful","Emma"
"4452",158,"pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,","Emma"
"4453",158,"","Emma"
"4454",158,"“Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account","Emma"
"4455",158,"for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak","Emma"
"4456",158,"either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough","Emma"
"4457",158,"to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.”","Emma"
"4458",158,"","Emma"
"4459",158,"But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at","Emma"
"4460",158,"all to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and","Emma"
"4461",158,"having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and","Emma"
"4462",158,"slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,—but","Emma"
"4463",158,"acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,—he","Emma"
"4464",158,"resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a","Emma"
"4465",158,"favourable answer.","Emma"
"4466",158,"","Emma"
"4467",158,"As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his","Emma"
"4468",158,"inconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,","Emma"
"4469",158,"replied,","Emma"
"4470",158,"","Emma"
"4471",158,"“It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself","Emma"
"4472",158,"too clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can","Emma"
"4473",158,"express. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last","Emma"
"4474",158,"month, to Miss Smith—such attentions as I have been in the daily habit","Emma"
"4475",158,"of observing—to be addressing me in this manner—this is an unsteadiness","Emma"
"4476",158,"of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible! Believe me,","Emma"
"4477",158,"sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such","Emma"
"4478",158,"professions.”","Emma"
"4479",158,"","Emma"
"4480",158,"“Good Heaven!” cried Mr. Elton, “what can be the meaning of this?—Miss","Emma"
"4481",158,"Smith!—I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my","Emma"
"4482",158,"existence—never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never","Emma"
"4483",158,"cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she has","Emma"
"4484",158,"fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very","Emma"
"4485",158,"sorry—extremely sorry—But, Miss Smith, indeed!—Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who","Emma"
"4486",158,"can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my","Emma"
"4487",158,"honour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of","Emma"
"4488",158,"you. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one","Emma"
"4489",158,"else. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has","Emma"
"4490",158,"been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannot","Emma"
"4491",158,"really, seriously, doubt it. No!—(in an accent meant to be","Emma"
"4492",158,"insinuating)—I am sure you have seen and understood me.”","Emma"
"4493",158,"","Emma"
"4494",158,"It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this—which of","Emma"
"4495",158,"all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completely","Emma"
"4496",158,"overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence","Emma"
"4497",158,"being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton’s sanguine state of mind, he","Emma"
"4498",158,"tried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed—","Emma"
"4499",158,"","Emma"
"4500",158,"“Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting","Emma"
"4501",158,"silence. It confesses that you have long understood me.”","Emma"
"4502",158,"","Emma"
"4503",158,"“No, sir,” cried Emma, “it confesses no such thing. So far from having","Emma"
"4504",158,"long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect","Emma"
"4505",158,"to your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you","Emma"
"4506",158,"should have been giving way to any feelings—Nothing could be farther","Emma"
"4507",158,"from my wishes—your attachment to my friend Harriet—your pursuit of","Emma"
"4508",158,"her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been","Emma"
"4509",158,"very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were","Emma"
"4510",158,"not your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you","Emma"
"4511",158,"judged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you","Emma"
"4512",158,"have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss","Emma"
"4513",158,"Smith?—that you have never thought seriously of her?”","Emma"
"4514",158,"","Emma"
"4515",158,"“Never, madam,” cried he, affronted in his turn: “never, I assure you.","Emma"
"4516",158,"_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!—Miss Smith is a very good sort of","Emma"
"4517",158,"girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish her","Emma"
"4518",158,"extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object","Emma"
"4519",158,"to—Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,","Emma"
"4520",158,"quite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal","Emma"
"4521",158,"alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!—No, madam, my","Emma"
"4522",158,"visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement","Emma"
"4523",158,"I received—”","Emma"
"4524",158,"","Emma"
"4525",158,"“Encouragement!—I give you encouragement!—Sir, you have been entirely","Emma"
"4526",158,"mistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my","Emma"
"4527",158,"friend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common","Emma"
"4528",158,"acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake","Emma"
"4529",158,"ends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might","Emma"
"4530",158,"have been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware,","Emma"
"4531",158,"probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you","Emma"
"4532",158,"are so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I","Emma"
"4533",158,"trust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at","Emma"
"4534",158,"present.”","Emma"
"4535",158,"","Emma"
"4536",158,"He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite","Emma"
"4537",158,"supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually","Emma"
"4538",158,"deep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer,","Emma"
"4539",158,"for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If","Emma"
"4540",158,"there had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate","Emma"
"4541",158,"awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the","Emma"
"4542",158,"little zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when the carriage","Emma"
"4543",158,"turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves,","Emma"
"4544",158,"all at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another","Emma"
"4545",158,"syllable passed.—Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good","Emma"
"4546",158,"night. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under","Emma"
"4547",158,"indescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to","Emma"
"4548",158,"Hartfield.","Emma"
"4549",158,"","Emma"
"4550",158,"There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, who had","Emma"
"4551",158,"been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage","Emma"
"4552",158,"Lane—turning a corner which he could never bear to think of—and in","Emma"
"4553",158,"strange hands—a mere common coachman—no James; and there it seemed as","Emma"
"4554",158,"if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr.","Emma"
"4555",158,"John Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness and","Emma"
"4556",158,"attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her","Emma"
"4557",158,"father, as to seem—if not quite ready to join him in a basin of","Emma"
"4558",158,"gruel—perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the","Emma"
"4559",158,"day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,","Emma"
"4560",158,"except herself.—But her mind had never been in such perturbation; and","Emma"
"4561",158,"it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till","Emma"
"4562",158,"the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet","Emma"
"4563",158,"reflection.","Emma"

"4569",158,"","Emma"
"4570",158,"","Emma"
"4571",158,"The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think","Emma"
"4572",158,"and be miserable.—It was a wretched business indeed!—Such an overthrow","Emma"
"4573",158,"of every thing she had been wishing for!—Such a development of every","Emma"
"4574",158,"thing most unwelcome!—Such a blow for Harriet!—that was the worst of","Emma"
"4575",158,"all. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or","Emma"
"4576",158,"other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and she","Emma"
"4577",158,"would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken—more in","Emma"
"4578",158,"error—more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the","Emma"
"4579",158,"effects of her blunders have been confined to herself.","Emma"
"4580",158,"","Emma"
"4581",158,"“If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have borne","Emma"

"4584",158,"","Emma"
"4585",158,"How she could have been so deceived!—He protested that he had never","Emma"

"4587",158,"could; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she","Emma"

"4594",158,"seemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its “ready","Emma"
"4595",158,"wit”—but then the “soft eyes”—in fact it suited neither; it was a","Emma"
"4596",158,"jumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through such","Emma"
"4597",158,"thick-headed nonsense?","Emma"
"4598",158,"","Emma"
"4599",158,"Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to","Emma"
"4600",158,"herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere","Emma"
"4601",158,"error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others","Emma"
"4602",158,"that he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the","Emma"
"4603",158,"gentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,","Emma"
"4604",158,"till this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean","Emma"
"4605",158,"any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet’s friend.","Emma"
"4606",158,"","Emma"
"4607",158,"To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the","Emma"
"4608",158,"subject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying","Emma"
"4609",158,"that those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley","Emma"
"4610",158,"had once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given, the","Emma"
"4611",158,"conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry","Emma"
"4612",158,"indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his","Emma"
"4613",158,"character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. It was","Emma"
"4614",158,"dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many","Emma"
"4615",158,"respects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;","Emma"
"4616",158,"proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little","Emma"
"4617",158,"concerned about the feelings of others.","Emma"
"4618",158,"","Emma"
"4619",158,"Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton’s wanting to pay his","Emma"
"4620",158,"addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and his","Emma"
"4621",158,"proposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment,","Emma"
"4622",158,"and was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having the","Emma"
"4623",158,"arrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she","Emma"
"4624",158,"was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need","Emma"
"4625",158,"be cared for. There had been no real affection either in his language","Emma"
"4626",158,"or manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she","Emma"
"4627",158,"could hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice,","Emma"
"4628",158,"less allied with real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him.","Emma"
"4629",158,"He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse","Emma"
"4630",158,"of Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so","Emma"
"4631",158,"easily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody","Emma"
"4632",158,"else with twenty, or with ten.","Emma"
"4633",158,"","Emma"
"4634",158,"But—that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware","Emma"
"4635",158,"of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry","Emma"
"4636",158,"him!—should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!—look down","Emma"
"4637",158,"upon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below","Emma"
"4638",158,"him, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no","Emma"
"4639",158,"presumption in addressing her!—It was most provoking.","Emma"
"4640",158,"","Emma"
"4641",158,"Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her","Emma"
"4642",158,"inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of","Emma"
"4643",158,"such equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that","Emma"
"4644",158,"in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He must know","Emma"
"4645",158,"that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at","Emma"
"4646",158,"Hartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family—and that the","Emma"
"4647",158,"Eltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was","Emma"
"4648",158,"inconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,","Emma"
"4649",158,"to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from","Emma"
"4650",158,"other sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell","Emma"
"4651",158,"Abbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses","Emma"
"4652",158,"had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood","Emma"
"4653",158,"which Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as","Emma"
"4654",158,"he could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend","Emma"
"4655",158,"him to notice but his situation and his civility.—But he had fancied","Emma"
"4656",158,"her in love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and","Emma"
"4657",158,"after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners","Emma"
"4658",158,"and a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and","Emma"
"4659",158,"admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and","Emma"
"4660",158,"obliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real","Emma"
"4661",158,"motive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and","Emma"
"4662",158,"delicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.","Emma"
"4663",158,"If _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to","Emma"
"4664",158,"wonder that _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken","Emma"
"4665",158,"hers.","Emma"
"4666",158,"","Emma"
"4667",158,"The first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it was","Emma"
"4668",158,"wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It","Emma"
"4669",158,"was adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought","Emma"
"4670",158,"to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She was quite","Emma"
"4671",158,"concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.","Emma"
"4672",158,"","Emma"
"4673",158,"“Here have I,” said she, “actually talked poor Harriet into being very","Emma"
"4674",158,"much attached to this man. She might never have thought of him but for","Emma"
"4675",158,"me; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I had","Emma"
"4676",158,"not assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as I","Emma"
"4677",158,"used to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her","Emma"
"4678",158,"not to accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done","Emma"
"4679",158,"of me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and","Emma"
"4680",158,"chance. I was introducing her into good company, and giving her the","Emma"
"4681",158,"opportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have","Emma"
"4682",158,"attempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.","Emma"
"4683",158,"I have been but half a friend to her; and if she were _not_ to feel","Emma"
"4684",158,"this disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any","Emma"
"4685",158,"body else who would be at all desirable for her;—William Coxe—Oh! no, I","Emma"
"4686",158,"could not endure William Coxe—a pert young lawyer.”","Emma"
"4687",158,"","Emma"
"4688",158,"She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a","Emma"
"4689",158,"more serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might","Emma"
"4690",158,"be, and must be. The distressing explanation she had to make to","Emma"
"4691",158,"Harriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the","Emma"
"4692",158,"awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or","Emma"
"4693",158,"discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing","Emma"
"4694",158,"resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in most","Emma"
"4695",158,"unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at last","Emma"
"4696",158,"with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most","Emma"
"4697",158,"dreadfully.","Emma"
"4698",158,"","Emma"
"4699",158,"To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma’s, though under temporary","Emma"
"4700",158,"gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of","Emma"
"4701",158,"spirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy,","Emma"
"4702",158,"and of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough","Emma"
"4703",158,"to keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of","Emma"
"4704",158,"softened pain and brighter hope.","Emma"
"4705",158,"","Emma"
"4706",158,"Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone","Emma"
"4707",158,"to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, and to","Emma"
"4708",158,"depend on getting tolerably out of it.","Emma"
"4709",158,"","Emma"
"4710",158,"It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love","Emma"
"4711",158,"with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to","Emma"
"4712",158,"disappoint him—that Harriet’s nature should not be of that superior","Emma"
"4713",158,"sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive—and that there","Emma"
"4714",158,"could be no necessity for any body’s knowing what had passed except the","Emma"
"4715",158,"three principals, and especially for her father’s being given a","Emma"
"4716",158,"moment’s uneasiness about it.","Emma"
"4717",158,"","Emma"
"4718",158,"These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of","Emma"
"4719",158,"snow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome","Emma"
"4720",158,"that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.","Emma"
"4721",158,"","Emma"
"4722",158,"The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she","Emma"
"4723",158,"could not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his","Emma"
"4724",158,"daughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either exciting","Emma"
"4725",158,"or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground covered","Emma"
"4726",158,"with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and","Emma"
"4727",158,"thaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every","Emma"
"4728",158,"morning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to","Emma"
"4729",158,"freeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner. No","Emma"
"4730",158,"intercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on","Emma"
"4731",158,"Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for","Emma"
"4732",158,"Mr. Elton’s absenting himself.","Emma"
"4733",158,"","Emma"
"4734",158,"It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and","Emma"
"4735",158,"though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some","Emma"
"4736",158,"society or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well","Emma"
"4737",158,"satisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir","Emma"
"4738",158,"out; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep","Emma"
"4739",158,"entirely from them,—","Emma"
"4740",158,"","Emma"
"4741",158,"“Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?”","Emma"
"4742",158,"","Emma"
"4743",158,"These days of confinement would have been, but for her private","Emma"
"4744",158,"perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited","Emma"
"4745",158,"her brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his","Emma"
"4746",158,"companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his","Emma"
"4747",158,"ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during","Emma"
"4748",158,"the rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and","Emma"
"4749",158,"obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes","Emma"
"4750",158,"of cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still","Emma"
"4751",158,"such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet,","Emma"
"4752",158,"as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.","Emma"

"4759",158,"","Emma"
"4760",158,"Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield. The","Emma"
"4761",158,"weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr.","Emma"
"4762",158,"Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter to stay","Emma"
"4763",158,"behind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole party set","Emma"
"4764",158,"off, and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor","Emma"
"4765",158,"Isabella;—which poor Isabella, passing her life with those she doated","Emma"
"4766",158,"on, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently","Emma"
"4767",158,"busy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.","Emma"
"4768",158,"","Emma"
"4769",158,"The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr.","Emma"
"4770",158,"Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with","Emma"
"4771",158,"Mr. Elton’s best compliments, “that he was proposing to leave Highbury","Emma"
"4772",158,"the following morning in his way to Bath; where, in compliance with the","Emma"
"4773",158,"pressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend a few","Emma"
"4774",158,"weeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, from","Emma"
"4775",158,"various circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal","Emma"
"4776",158,"leave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he should ever","Emma"
"4777",158,"retain a grateful sense—and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be","Emma"
"4778",158,"happy to attend to them.”","Emma"
"4779",158,"","Emma"
"4780",158,"Emma was most agreeably surprized.—Mr. Elton’s absence just at this","Emma"
"4781",158,"time was the very thing to be desired. She admired him for contriving","Emma"
"4782",158,"it, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it","Emma"
"4783",158,"was announced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than","Emma"
"4784",158,"in a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded.","Emma"
"4785",158,"She had not even a share in his opening compliments.—Her name was not","Emma"
"4786",158,"mentioned;—and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an","Emma"
"4787",158,"ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments,","Emma"
"4788",158,"as she thought, at first, could not escape her father’s suspicion.","Emma"
"4789",158,"","Emma"
"4790",158,"It did, however.—Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so","Emma"
"4791",158,"sudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely","Emma"
"4792",158,"to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language. It was","Emma"
"4793",158,"a very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought","Emma"
"4794",158,"and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. Mr. Woodhouse","Emma"
"4795",158,"talked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away","Emma"
"4796",158,"with all her usual promptitude.","Emma"
"4797",158,"","Emma"
"4798",158,"She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She had reason","Emma"
"4799",158,"to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable","Emma"
"4800",158,"that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of","Emma"
"4801",158,"her other complaint before the gentleman’s return. She went to Mrs.","Emma"
"4802",158,"Goddard’s accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary","Emma"
"4803",158,"penance of communication; and a severe one it was.—She had to destroy","Emma"
"4804",158,"all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding—to appear in","Emma"
"4805",158,"the ungracious character of the one preferred—and acknowledge herself","Emma"
"4806",158,"grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject, all","Emma"
"4807",158,"her observations, all her convictions, all her prophecies for the last","Emma"
"4808",158,"six weeks.","Emma"
"4809",158,"","Emma"
"4810",158,"The confession completely renewed her first shame—and the sight of","Emma"
"4811",158,"Harriet’s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with","Emma"
"4812",158,"herself again.","Emma"
"4813",158,"","Emma"
"4814",158,"Harriet bore the intelligence very well—blaming nobody—and in every","Emma"
"4815",158,"thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion","Emma"
"4816",158,"of herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to","Emma"
"4817",158,"her friend.","Emma"
"4818",158,"","Emma"
"4819",158,"Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;","Emma"
"4820",158,"and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on","Emma"
"4821",158,"Harriet’s side, not her own. Harriet did not consider herself as having","Emma"
"4822",158,"any thing to complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton","Emma"
"4823",158,"would have been too great a distinction.—She never could have deserved","Emma"
"4824",158,"him—and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would","Emma"
"4825",158,"have thought it possible.","Emma"
"4826",158,"","Emma"
"4827",158,"Her tears fell abundantly—but her grief was so truly artless, that no","Emma"
"4828",158,"dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma’s eyes—and she","Emma"
"4829",158,"listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and","Emma"
"4830",158,"understanding—really for the time convinced that Harriet was the","Emma"
"4831",158,"superior creature of the two—and that to resemble her would be more for","Emma"
"4832",158,"her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence","Emma"
"4833",158,"could do.","Emma"
"4834",158,"","Emma"
"4835",158,"It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and","Emma"
"4836",158,"ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of","Emma"
"4837",158,"being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of","Emma"
"4838",158,"her life. Her second duty now, inferior only to her father’s claims,","Emma"
"4839",158,"was to promote Harriet’s comfort, and endeavour to prove her own","Emma"
"4840",158,"affection in some better method than by match-making. She got her to","Emma"
"4841",158,"Hartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying kindness, striving to","Emma"
"4842",158,"occupy and amuse her, and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton","Emma"
"4843",158,"from her thoughts.","Emma"
"4844",158,"","Emma"
"4845",158,"Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she","Emma"
"4846",158,"could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in","Emma"
"4847",158,"general, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr.","Emma"
"4848",158,"Elton in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet’s","Emma"
"4849",158,"age, and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might","Emma"
"4850",158,"be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton’s return,","Emma"
"4851",158,"as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of","Emma"
"4852",158,"acquaintance, without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing","Emma"
"4853",158,"them.","Emma"
"4854",158,"","Emma"
"4855",158,"Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence","Emma"
"4856",158,"of any body equal to him in person or goodness—and did, in truth, prove","Emma"
"4857",158,"herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet it","Emma"
"4858",158,"appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive against an","Emma"
"4859",158,"inclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she could not comprehend","Emma"
"4860",158,"its continuing very long in equal force.","Emma"
"4861",158,"","Emma"
"4862",158,"If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and","Emma"
"4863",158,"indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could not","Emma"
"4864",158,"imagine Harriet’s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the","Emma"
"4865",158,"recollection of him.","Emma"
"4866",158,"","Emma"
"4867",158,"Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for","Emma"
"4868",158,"each, for all three. Not one of them had the power of removal, or of","Emma"
"4869",158,"effecting any material change of society. They must encounter each","Emma"
"4870",158,"other, and make the best of it.","Emma"
"4871",158,"","Emma"
"4872",158,"Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs.","Emma"
"4873",158,"Goddard’s; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great","Emma"
"4874",158,"girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could","Emma"
"4875",158,"have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or","Emma"
"4876",158,"repellent truth. Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be","Emma"
"4877",158,"found if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she saw her in the way of","Emma"
"4878",158,"cure, there could be no true peace for herself.","Emma"

"4887",158,"Mrs. Weston’s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of","Emma"
"4888",158,"excuse. For the present, he could not be spared, to his “very great","Emma"
"4889",158,"mortification and regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of","Emma"

"4891",158,"","Emma"

"4897",158,"and begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and","Emma"
"4898",158,"sorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank’s coming two or three","Emma"
"4899",158,"months later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better","Emma"
"4900",158,"weather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay","Emma"
"4901",158,"considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner.","Emma"
"4902",158,"","Emma"
"4903",158,"These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of a","Emma"
"4904",158,"more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of","Emma"
"4905",158,"excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was","Emma"
"4906",158,"to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.","Emma"
"4907",158,"","Emma"
"4908",158,"Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about","Emma"
"4909",158,"Mr. Frank Churchill’s not coming, except as a disappointment at","Emma"
"4910",158,"Randalls. The acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She wanted,","Emma"
"4911",158,"rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was","Emma"
"4912",158,"desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self, she","Emma"
"4913",158,"took care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as","Emma"
"4914",158,"warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston’s disappointment, as might naturally","Emma"
"4915",158,"belong to their friendship.","Emma"
"4916",158,"","Emma"
"4917",158,"She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite","Emma"
"4918",158,"as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather","Emma"
"4919",158,"more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. She then","Emma"
"4920",158,"proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of","Emma"
"4921",158,"such an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of","Emma"
"4922",158,"looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the","Emma"
"4923",158,"sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the","Emma"
"4924",158,"Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement","Emma"
"4925",158,"with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was","Emma"
"4926",158,"taking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making","Emma"
"4927",158,"use of Mrs. Weston’s arguments against herself.","Emma"
"4928",158,"","Emma"
"4929",158,"“The Churchills are very likely in fault,” said Mr. Knightley, coolly;","Emma"
"4930",158,"“but I dare say he might come if he would.”","Emma"
"4931",158,"","Emma"
"4932",158,"“I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come;","Emma"
"4933",158,"but his uncle and aunt will not spare him.”","Emma"
"4934",158,"","Emma"
"4935",158,"“I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a","Emma"
"4936",158,"point of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.”","Emma"
"4937",158,"","Emma"
"4938",158,"“How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you","Emma"
"4939",158,"suppose him such an unnatural creature?”","Emma"
"4940",158,"","Emma"
"4941",158,"“I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting","Emma"
"4942",158,"that he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very","Emma"
"4943",158,"little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who","Emma"
"4944",158,"have always set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural","Emma"
"4945",158,"than one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are","Emma"
"4946",158,"proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish","Emma"
"4947",158,"too. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have","Emma"
"4948",158,"contrived it between September and January. A man at his age—what is","Emma"
"4949",158,"he?—three or four-and-twenty—cannot be without the means of doing as","Emma"
"4950",158,"much as that. It is impossible.”","Emma"
"4951",158,"","Emma"
"4952",158,"“That’s easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your","Emma"
"4953",158,"own master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the","Emma"
"4954",158,"difficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers","Emma"
"4955",158,"to manage.”","Emma"
"4956",158,"","Emma"
"4957",158,"“It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty","Emma"
"4958",158,"should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want","Emma"
"4959",158,"money—he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so","Emma"
"4960",158,"much of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts","Emma"
"4961",158,"in the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or","Emma"
"4962",158,"other. A little while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can","Emma"
"4963",158,"leave the Churchills.”","Emma"
"4964",158,"","Emma"
"4965",158,"“Yes, sometimes he can.”","Emma"
"4966",158,"","Emma"
"4967",158,"“And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever","Emma"
"4968",158,"there is any temptation of pleasure.”","Emma"
"4969",158,"","Emma"
"4970",158,"“It is very unfair to judge of any body’s conduct, without an intimate","Emma"
"4971",158,"knowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior","Emma"
"4972",158,"of a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that","Emma"
"4973",158,"family may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs.","Emma"
"4974",158,"Churchill’s temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew","Emma"
"4975",158,"can do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can","Emma"
"4976",158,"at others.”","Emma"
"4977",158,"","Emma"
"4978",158,"“There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and","Emma"
"4979",158,"that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and","Emma"
"4980",158,"resolution. It is Frank Churchill’s duty to pay this attention to his","Emma"
"4981",158,"father. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he","Emma"
"4982",158,"wished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at","Emma"
"4983",158,"once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill—‘Every sacrifice of mere","Emma"
"4984",158,"pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but","Emma"
"4985",158,"I must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by my","Emma"
"4986",158,"failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion. I","Emma"
"4987",158,"shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.’—If he would say so to her at","Emma"
"4988",158,"once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no","Emma"
"4989",158,"opposition made to his going.”","Emma"
"4990",158,"","Emma"
"4991",158,"“No,” said Emma, laughing; “but perhaps there might be some made to his","Emma"
"4992",158,"coming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to","Emma"
"4993",158,"use!—Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you","Emma"
"4994",158,"have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite","Emma"
"4995",158,"to your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to","Emma"
"4996",158,"the uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for","Emma"
"4997",158,"him!—Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as","Emma"
"4998",158,"loud as he could!—How can you imagine such conduct practicable?”","Emma"
"4999",158,"","Emma"
"5000",158,"“Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.","Emma"
"5001",158,"He would feel himself in the right; and the declaration—made, of","Emma"
"5002",158,"course, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner—would do","Emma"
"5003",158,"him more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the","Emma"
"5004",158,"people he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients","Emma"
"5005",158,"can ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that","Emma"
"5006",158,"they could trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his","Emma"
"5007",158,"father, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as","Emma"
"5008",158,"well as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his","Emma"
"5009",158,"father; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their","Emma"
"5010",158,"hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims.","Emma"
"5011",158,"Respect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in","Emma"
"5012",158,"this sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their","Emma"
"5013",158,"little minds would bend to his.”","Emma"
"5014",158,"","Emma"
"5015",158,"“I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but","Emma"
"5016",158,"where little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they","Emma"
"5017",158,"have a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as","Emma"
"5018",158,"great ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were","Emma"
"5019",158,"to be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill’s","Emma"
"5020",158,"situation, you would be able to say and do just what you have been","Emma"
"5021",158,"recommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. The","Emma"
"5022",158,"Churchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would","Emma"
"5023",158,"have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through.","Emma"
"5024",158,"To him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into","Emma"
"5025",158,"perfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and","Emma"
"5026",158,"regard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right,","Emma"
"5027",158,"as you can have, without being so equal, under particular","Emma"
"5028",158,"circumstances, to act up to it.”","Emma"
"5029",158,"","Emma"
"5030",158,"“Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal","Emma"
"5031",158,"exertion, it could not be an equal conviction.”","Emma"
"5032",158,"","Emma"
"5033",158,"“Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to","Emma"
"5034",158,"understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly","Emma"
"5035",158,"opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his","Emma"
"5036",158,"life.”","Emma"
"5037",158,"","Emma"
"5038",158,"“Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first","Emma"
"5039",158,"occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the","Emma"
"5040",158,"will of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of","Emma"
"5041",158,"following his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for","Emma"
"5042",158,"the fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became rational, he","Emma"
"5043",158,"ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in","Emma"
"5044",158,"their authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their","Emma"
"5045",158,"side to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there","Emma"

"5047",158,"","Emma"
"5048",158,"“We shall never agree about him,” cried Emma; “but that is nothing","Emma"
"5049",158,"extraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:","Emma"
"5050",158,"I feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,","Emma"
"5051",158,"though in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,","Emma"
"5052",158,"complying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man’s","Emma"
"5053",158,"perfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some","Emma"
"5054",158,"advantages, it will secure him many others.”","Emma"
"5055",158,"","Emma"
"5056",158,"“Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and of","Emma"
"5057",158,"leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely","Emma"
"5058",158,"expert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fine","Emma"
"5059",158,"flourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade","Emma"
"5060",158,"himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of","Emma"
"5061",158,"preserving peace at home and preventing his father’s having any right","Emma"
"5062",158,"to complain. His letters disgust me.”","Emma"

"5064",158,"“Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else.”","Emma"
"5065",158,"","Emma"
"5066",158,"“I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy a","Emma"
"5067",158,"woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother’s","Emma"
"5068",158,"place, but without a mother’s affection to blind her. It is on her","Emma"
"5069",158,"account that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly","Emma"
"5070",158,"feel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, he","Emma"
"5071",158,"would have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether he","Emma"
"5072",158,"did or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of","Emma"
"5073",158,"considerations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to","Emma"
"5074",158,"herself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in","Emma"
"5075",158,"French, not in English. He may be very ‘amiable,’ have very good","Emma"
"5076",158,"manners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy","Emma"
"5077",158,"towards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about","Emma"

"5081",158,"","Emma"
"5082",158,"“Me!—not at all,” replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; “I do not","Emma"
"5083",158,"want to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his","Emma"
"5084",158,"merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely","Emma"

"5090",158,"agreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the","Emma"
"5091",158,"bargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a _sensation_ his","Emma"
"5092",158,"coming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the","Emma"
"5093",158,"parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest—one object of","Emma"

"5147",158,"CHAPTER I","Emma"
"5148",158,"","Emma"
"5149",158,"","Emma"
"5150",158,"Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma’s","Emma"
"5151",158,"opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She could","Emma"
"5152",158,"not think that Harriet’s solace or her own sins required more; and she","Emma"
"5153",158,"was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they","Emma"
"5154",158,"returned;—but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded,","Emma"
"5155",158,"and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter,","Emma"
"5156",158,"and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive—“Mr. Elton is so","Emma"
"5157",158,"good to the poor!” she found something else must be done.","Emma"
"5158",158,"","Emma"
"5159",158,"They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.","Emma"
"5160",158,"She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. There was","Emma"
"5161",158,"always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates","Emma"
"5162",158,"loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the very few","Emma"
"5163",158,"who presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in","Emma"
"5164",158,"that respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of","Emma"
"5165",158,"their scanty comforts.","Emma"
"5166",158,"","Emma"
"5167",158,"She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,","Emma"
"5168",158,"as to her deficiency—but none were equal to counteract the persuasion","Emma"
"5169",158,"of its being very disagreeable,—a waste of time—tiresome women—and all","Emma"
"5170",158,"the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and","Emma"
"5171",158,"third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and","Emma"
"5172",158,"therefore she seldom went near them. But now she made the sudden","Emma"
"5173",158,"resolution of not passing their door without going in—observing, as she","Emma"
"5174",158,"proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate, they were","Emma"
"5175",158,"just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.","Emma"
"5176",158,"","Emma"
"5177",158,"The house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied","Emma"
"5178",158,"the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized","Emma"
"5179",158,"apartment, which was every thing to them, the visitors were most","Emma"
"5180",158,"cordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who","Emma"
"5181",158,"with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to","Emma"
"5182",158,"give up her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking","Emma"
"5183",158,"daughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks","Emma"
"5184",158,"for their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after","Emma"
"5185",158,"Mr. Woodhouse’s health, cheerful communications about her mother’s, and","Emma"
"5186",158,"sweet-cake from the beaufet—“Mrs. Cole had just been there, just called","Emma"
"5187",158,"in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them,","Emma"
"5188",158,"and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she","Emma"
"5189",158,"liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss","Emma"
"5190",158,"Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too.”","Emma"
"5191",158,"","Emma"
"5192",158,"The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.","Emma"
"5193",158,"There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton","Emma"
"5194",158,"since his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must have the","Emma"

"5196",158,"he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he","Emma"
"5197",158,"went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies’ ball had been; and she","Emma"
"5198",158,"went through it very well, with all the interest and all the","Emma"
"5199",158,"commendation that could be requisite, and always putting forward to","Emma"
"5200",158,"prevent Harriet’s being obliged to say a word.","Emma"
"5201",158,"","Emma"
"5202",158,"This she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant,","Emma"
"5203",158,"having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by","Emma"
"5204",158,"any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the","Emma"
"5205",158,"Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She had not","Emma"
"5206",158,"been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was","Emma"
"5207",158,"actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at last","Emma"
"5208",158,"abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.","Emma"
"5209",158,"","Emma"
"5210",158,"“Oh! yes—Mr. Elton, I understand—certainly as to dancing—Mrs. Cole was","Emma"
"5211",158,"telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was—Mrs. Cole was so kind","Emma"
"5212",158,"as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon as she came","Emma"
"5213",158,"in, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very great a favourite","Emma"
"5214",158,"there. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her","Emma"
"5215",158,"kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any","Emma"
"5216",158,"body can. And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, ‘I","Emma"
"5217",158,"know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time","Emma"
"5218",158,"for writing;’ and when I immediately said, ‘But indeed we have, we had","Emma"
"5219",158,"a letter this very morning,’ I do not know that I ever saw any body","Emma"
"5220",158,"more surprized. ‘Have you, upon your honour?’ said she; ‘well, that is","Emma"
"5221",158,"quite unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.’”","Emma"
"5222",158,"","Emma"
"5223",158,"Emma’s politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest—","Emma"
"5224",158,"","Emma"
"5225",158,"“Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I","Emma"
"5226",158,"hope she is well?”","Emma"
"5227",158,"","Emma"
"5228",158,"“Thank you. You are so kind!” replied the happily deceived aunt, while","Emma"
"5229",158,"eagerly hunting for the letter.—“Oh! here it is. I was sure it could","Emma"
"5230",158,"not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without","Emma"
"5231",158,"being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very","Emma"
"5232",158,"lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it","Emma"
"5233",158,"to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my","Emma"
"5234",158,"mother, for it is such a pleasure to her—a letter from Jane—that she","Emma"
"5235",158,"can never hear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and","Emma"
"5236",158,"here it is, only just under my huswife—and since you are so kind as to","Emma"
"5237",158,"wish to hear what she says;—but, first of all, I really must, in","Emma"
"5238",158,"justice to Jane, apologise for her writing so short a letter—only two","Emma"
"5239",158,"pages you see—hardly two—and in general she fills the whole paper and","Emma"
"5240",158,"crosses half. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.","Emma"
"5241",158,"She often says, when the letter is first opened, ‘Well, Hetty, now I","Emma"
"5242",158,"think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work’—don’t","Emma"
"5243",158,"you, ma’am?—And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make","Emma"
"5244",158,"it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her—every word of it—I","Emma"
"5245",158,"am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word. And,","Emma"
"5246",158,"indeed, though my mother’s eyes are not so good as they were, she can","Emma"
"5247",158,"see amazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is","Emma"
"5248",158,"such a blessing! My mother’s are really very good indeed. Jane often","Emma"
"5249",158,"says, when she is here, ‘I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very","Emma"
"5250",158,"strong eyes to see as you do—and so much fine work as you have done","Emma"
"5251",158,"too!—I only wish my eyes may last me as well.’”","Emma"
"5252",158,"","Emma"
"5253",158,"All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;","Emma"
"5254",158,"and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss","Emma"
"5255",158,"Fairfax’s handwriting.","Emma"
"5256",158,"","Emma"
"5257",158,"“You are extremely kind,” replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; “you","Emma"
"5258",158,"who are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure","Emma"
"5259",158,"there is nobody’s praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss","Emma"
"5260",158,"Woodhouse’s. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know.","Emma"
"5261",158,"Ma’am,” addressing her, “do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging","Emma"
"5262",158,"to say about Jane’s handwriting?”","Emma"
"5263",158,"","Emma"
"5264",158,"And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated","Emma"
"5265",158,"twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. She was","Emma"
"5266",158,"pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very","Emma"
"5267",158,"rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax’s letter, and had almost","Emma"
"5268",158,"resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when Miss","Emma"
"5269",158,"Bates turned to her again and seized her attention.","Emma"
"5270",158,"","Emma"
"5271",158,"“My mother’s deafness is very trifling you see—just nothing at all. By","Emma"
"5272",158,"only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,","Emma"
"5273",158,"she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is very","Emma"
"5274",158,"remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.","Emma"
"5275",158,"Jane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at","Emma"
"5276",158,"all deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at","Emma"
"5277",158,"my mother’s time of life—and it really is full two years, you know,","Emma"
"5278",158,"since she was here. We never were so long without seeing her before,","Emma"
"5279",158,"and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough","Emma"
"5280",158,"of her now.”","Emma"
"5281",158,"","Emma"
"5282",158,"“Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?”","Emma"
"5283",158,"","Emma"
"5284",158,"“Oh yes; next week.”","Emma"
"5285",158,"","Emma"
"5286",158,"“Indeed!—that must be a very great pleasure.”","Emma"
"5287",158,"","Emma"
"5288",158,"“Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is so","Emma"
"5289",158,"surprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure she","Emma"
"5290",158,"will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to see","Emma"
"5291",158,"her. Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because Colonel","Emma"
"5292",158,"Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. So","Emma"
"5293",158,"very good of them to send her the whole way! But they always do, you","Emma"
"5294",158,"know. Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she writes about.","Emma"
"5295",158,"That is the reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in","Emma"
"5296",158,"the common course, we should not have heard from her before next","Emma"
"5297",158,"Tuesday or Wednesday.”","Emma"
"5298",158,"","Emma"
"5299",158,"“Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my","Emma"
"5300",158,"hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.”","Emma"
"5301",158,"","Emma"
"5302",158,"“So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been","Emma"
"5303",158,"for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon. My","Emma"
"5304",158,"mother is so delighted!—for she is to be three months with us at least.","Emma"
"5305",158,"Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the","Emma"
"5306",158,"pleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells","Emma"
"5307",158,"are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to","Emma"
"5308",158,"come over and see her directly. They had not intended to go over till","Emma"
"5309",158,"the summer, but she is so impatient to see them again—for till she","Emma"
"5310",158,"married, last October, she was never away from them so much as a week,","Emma"
"5311",158,"which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was","Emma"
"5312",158,"going to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote a very","Emma"
"5313",158,"urgent letter to her mother—or her father, I declare I do not know","Emma"
"5314",158,"which it was, but we shall see presently in Jane’s letter—wrote in Mr.","Emma"
"5315",158,"Dixon’s name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly,","Emma"
"5316",158,"and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to","Emma"
"5317",158,"their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has","Emma"
"5318",158,"heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean—I do not know","Emma"
"5319",158,"that she ever heard about it from any body else; but it was very","Emma"
"5320",158,"natural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own place while","Emma"
"5321",158,"he was paying his addresses—and as Jane used to be very often walking","Emma"
"5322",158,"out with them—for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about","Emma"
"5323",158,"their daughter’s not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I","Emma"
"5324",158,"do not at all blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be","Emma"
"5325",158,"telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she","Emma"
"5326",158,"wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views","Emma"
"5327",158,"that he had taken himself. He is a most amiable, charming young man, I","Emma"
"5328",158,"believe. Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account of","Emma"
"5329",158,"things.”","Emma"
"5330",158,"","Emma"
"5331",158,"At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma’s","Emma"
"5332",158,"brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not","Emma"
"5333",158,"going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther","Emma"
"5334",158,"discovery,","Emma"
"5335",158,"","Emma"
"5336",158,"“You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to","Emma"
"5337",158,"come to you at such a time. Considering the very particular friendship","Emma"
"5338",158,"between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be","Emma"
"5339",158,"excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.”","Emma"
"5340",158,"","Emma"
"5341",158,"“Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always been","Emma"
"5342",158,"rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at such a","Emma"
"5343",158,"distance from us, for months together—not able to come if any thing was","Emma"
"5344",158,"to happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. They want","Emma"
"5345",158,"her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs.","Emma"
"5346",158,"Campbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing","Emma"
"5347",158,"than their _joint_ invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently;","Emma"
"5348",158,"Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He is a","Emma"
"5349",158,"most charming young man. Ever since the service he rendered Jane at","Emma"
"5350",158,"Weymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by","Emma"
"5351",158,"the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would","Emma"
"5352",158,"have been dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone,","Emma"
"5353",158,"if he had not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her","Emma"
"5354",158,"habit— (I can never think of it without trembling!)—But ever since we","Emma"
"5355",158,"had the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!”","Emma"
"5356",158,"","Emma"
"5357",158,"“But, in spite of all her friends’ urgency, and her own wish of seeing","Emma"
"5358",158,"Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates?”","Emma"
"5359",158,"","Emma"
"5360",158,"“Yes—entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel and","Emma"
"5361",158,"Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they should","Emma"
"5362",158,"recommend; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native","Emma"
"5363",158,"air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.”","Emma"
"5364",158,"","Emma"
"5365",158,"“I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs.","Emma"
"5366",158,"Dixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has no","Emma"
"5367",158,"remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be","Emma"
"5368",158,"compared with Miss Fairfax.”","Emma"
"5369",158,"","Emma"
"5370",158,"“Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things—but certainly not.","Emma"
"5371",158,"There is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was","Emma"
"5372",158,"absolutely plain—but extremely elegant and amiable.”","Emma"
"5373",158,"","Emma"
"5374",158,"“Yes, that of course.”","Emma"
"5375",158,"","Emma"
"5376",158,"“Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of","Emma"
"5377",158,"November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well","Emma"
"5378",158,"since. A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She never","Emma"
"5379",158,"mentioned it before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! so","Emma"
"5380",158,"considerate!—But however, she is so far from well, that her kind","Emma"
"5381",158,"friends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an air","Emma"
"5382",158,"that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or four","Emma"
"5383",158,"months at Highbury will entirely cure her—and it is certainly a great","Emma"
"5384",158,"deal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is","Emma"
"5385",158,"unwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do.”","Emma"
"5386",158,"","Emma"
"5387",158,"“It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.”","Emma"
"5388",158,"","Emma"
"5389",158,"“And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells","Emma"
"5390",158,"leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following—as you will","Emma"
"5391",158,"find from Jane’s letter. So sudden!—You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse,","Emma"
"5392",158,"what a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback of","Emma"
"5393",158,"her illness—but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, and","Emma"
"5394",158,"looking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to","Emma"
"5395",158,"me, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane’s letters through","Emma"
"5396",158,"to myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for","Emma"
"5397",158,"fear of there being any thing in them to distress her. Jane desired me","Emma"
"5398",158,"to do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution;","Emma"
"5399",158,"but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I","Emma"
"5400",158,"burst out, quite frightened, with ‘Bless me! poor Jane is ill!’—which","Emma"
"5401",158,"my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed","Emma"
"5402",158,"at. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had","Emma"
"5403",158,"fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she does","Emma"
"5404",158,"not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my","Emma"
"5405",158,"guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The","Emma"
"5406",158,"expense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so","Emma"
"5407",158,"fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for","Emma"
"5408",158,"attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife","Emma"
"5409",158,"and family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well,","Emma"
"5410",158,"now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will","Emma"
"5411",158,"turn to her letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal","Emma"
"5412",158,"better than I can tell it for her.”","Emma"
"5413",158,"","Emma"
"5414",158,"“I am afraid we must be running away,” said Emma, glancing at Harriet,","Emma"
"5415",158,"and beginning to rise—“My father will be expecting us. I had no","Emma"
"5416",158,"intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes,","Emma"
"5417",158,"when I first entered the house. I merely called, because I would not","Emma"
"5418",158,"pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have been so","Emma"
"5419",158,"pleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good","Emma"
"5420",158,"morning.”","Emma"
"5421",158,"","Emma"
"5422",158,"And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. She regained","Emma"
"5423",158,"the street—happy in this, that though much had been forced on her","Emma"
"5424",158,"against her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance of","Emma"
"5425",158,"Jane Fairfax’s letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.","Emma"

"5430",158,"CHAPTER II","Emma"
"5431",158,"","Emma"
"5432",158,"","Emma"
"5433",158,"Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates’s youngest","Emma"
"5434",158,"daughter.","Emma"
"5435",158,"","Emma"
"5436",158,"The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the ——regiment of infantry, and Miss","Emma"
"5437",158,"Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope and interest;","Emma"
"5438",158,"but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy remembrance of him","Emma"
"5439",158,"dying in action abroad—of his widow sinking under consumption and grief","Emma"
"5440",158,"soon afterwards—and this girl.","Emma"
"5441",158,"","Emma"
"5442",158,"By birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, on","Emma"
"5443",158,"losing her mother, she became the property, the charge, the","Emma"
"5444",158,"consolation, the foundling of her grandmother and aunt, there had","Emma"
"5445",158,"seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there; of her","Emma"
"5446",158,"being taught only what very limited means could command, and growing up","Emma"
"5447",158,"with no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what","Emma"
"5448",158,"nature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and","Emma"
"5449",158,"warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.","Emma"
"5450",158,"","Emma"
"5451",158,"But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change","Emma"
"5452",158,"to her destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded","Emma"
"5453",158,"Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and","Emma"
"5454",158,"farther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a severe","Emma"
"5455",158,"camp-fever, as he believed had saved his life. These were claims which","Emma"
"5456",158,"he did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the","Emma"
"5457",158,"death of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put any thing","Emma"
"5458",158,"in his power. When he did return, he sought out the child and took","Emma"
"5459",158,"notice of her. He was a married man, with only one living child, a","Emma"
"5460",158,"girl, about Jane’s age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long","Emma"
"5461",158,"visits and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years","Emma"
"5462",158,"old, his daughter’s great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a","Emma"
"5463",158,"real friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of","Emma"
"5464",158,"undertaking the whole charge of her education. It was accepted; and","Emma"
"5465",158,"from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell’s family, and","Emma"
"5466",158,"had lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother from time","Emma"
"5467",158,"to time.","Emma"
"5468",158,"","Emma"
"5469",158,"The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the","Emma"
"5470",158,"very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making","Emma"
"5471",158,"independence impossible. To provide for her otherwise was out of","Emma"
"5472",158,"Colonel Campbell’s power; for though his income, by pay and","Emma"
"5473",158,"appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all","Emma"
"5474",158,"his daughter’s; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be","Emma"
"5475",158,"supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.","Emma"
"5476",158,"","Emma"
"5477",158,"Such was Jane Fairfax’s history. She had fallen into good hands, known","Emma"
"5478",158,"nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent","Emma"
"5479",158,"education. Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed","Emma"
"5480",158,"people, her heart and understanding had received every advantage of","Emma"
"5481",158,"discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell’s residence being in","Emma"
"5482",158,"London, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the","Emma"
"5483",158,"attendance of first-rate masters. Her disposition and abilities were","Emma"
"5484",158,"equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or","Emma"
"5485",158,"nineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the","Emma"
"5486",158,"care of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself;","Emma"
"5487",158,"but she was too much beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor","Emma"
"5488",158,"mother could promote, and the daughter could not endure it. The evil","Emma"
"5489",158,"day was put off. It was easy to decide that she was still too young;","Emma"
"5490",158,"and Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the","Emma"
"5491",158,"rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of","Emma"
"5492",158,"home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the sobering","Emma"
"5493",158,"suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this","Emma"
"5494",158,"might soon be over.","Emma"
"5495",158,"","Emma"
"5496",158,"The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss Campbell","Emma"
"5497",158,"in particular, was the more honourable to each party from the","Emma"
"5498",158,"circumstance of Jane’s decided superiority both in beauty and","Emma"
"5499",158,"acquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen","Emma"
"5500",158,"by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by","Emma"
"5501",158,"the parents. They continued together with unabated regard however, till","Emma"
"5502",158,"the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so","Emma"
"5503",158,"often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to","Emma"
"5504",158,"what is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the","Emma"
"5505",158,"affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as","Emma"
"5506",158,"soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled,","Emma"
"5507",158,"while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.","Emma"
"5508",158,"","Emma"
"5509",158,"This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be","Emma"
"5510",158,"yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path","Emma"
"5511",158,"of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had","Emma"
"5512",158,"fixed on for beginning. She had long resolved that one-and-twenty","Emma"
"5513",158,"should be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she","Emma"
"5514",158,"had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire","Emma"
"5515",158,"from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society,","Emma"
"5516",158,"peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.","Emma"
"5517",158,"","Emma"
"5518",158,"The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a","Emma"
"5519",158,"resolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, no","Emma"
"5520",158,"exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and","Emma"
"5521",158,"for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this","Emma"
"5522",158,"would be selfishness:—what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps","Emma"
"5523",158,"they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted","Emma"
"5524",158,"the temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such","Emma"
"5525",158,"enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still,","Emma"
"5526",158,"however, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not","Emma"
"5527",158,"hurrying on the wretched moment. She had never been quite well since","Emma"
"5528",158,"the time of their daughter’s marriage; and till she should have","Emma"
"5529",158,"completely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging","Emma"
"5530",158,"in duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame","Emma"
"5531",158,"and varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances,","Emma"
"5532",158,"to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be","Emma"
"5533",158,"discharged with tolerable comfort.","Emma"
"5534",158,"","Emma"
"5535",158,"With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her","Emma"
"5536",158,"aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths not","Emma"
"5537",158,"told. It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to","Emma"
"5538",158,"Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with","Emma"
"5539",158,"those kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,","Emma"
"5540",158,"whatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double,","Emma"
"5541",158,"or treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that","Emma"
"5542",158,"they depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the","Emma"
"5543",158,"recovery of her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that she","Emma"
"5544",158,"was to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect","Emma"
"5545",158,"novelty which had been so long promised it—Mr. Frank Churchill—must put","Emma"
"5546",158,"up for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the","Emma"
"5547",158,"freshness of a two years’ absence.","Emma"
"5548",158,"","Emma"
"5549",158,"Emma was sorry;—to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like","Emma"
"5550",158,"through three long months!—to be always doing more than she wished, and","Emma"
"5551",158,"less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a","Emma"
"5552",158,"difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was","Emma"
"5553",158,"because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she","Emma"
"5554",158,"wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been","Emma"
"5555",158,"eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in","Emma"
"5556",158,"which her conscience could not quite acquit her. But “she could never","Emma"
"5557",158,"get acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was","Emma"
"5558",158,"such coldness and reserve—such apparent indifference whether she","Emma"
"5559",158,"pleased or not—and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!—and she","Emma"
"5560",158,"was made such a fuss with by every body!—and it had been always","Emma"
"5561",158,"imagined that they were to be so intimate—because their ages were the","Emma"
"5562",158,"same, every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other.”","Emma"
"5563",158,"These were her reasons—she had no better.","Emma"
"5564",158,"","Emma"
"5565",158,"It was a dislike so little just—every imputed fault was so magnified by","Emma"
"5566",158,"fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any","Emma"
"5567",158,"considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and","Emma"
"5568",158,"now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years’","Emma"
"5569",158,"interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and","Emma"
"5570",158,"manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.","Emma"
"5571",158,"Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself","Emma"
"5572",158,"the highest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as","Emma"
"5573",158,"almost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall;","Emma"
"5574",158,"her figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium,","Emma"
"5575",158,"between fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed","Emma"
"5576",158,"to point out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all","Emma"
"5577",158,"this; and then, her face—her features—there was more beauty in them","Emma"
"5578",158,"altogether than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very","Emma"
"5579",158,"pleasing beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and","Emma"
"5580",158,"eyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she","Emma"
"5581",158,"had been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and","Emma"
"5582",158,"delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty,","Emma"
"5583",158,"of which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she must, in","Emma"
"5584",158,"honour, by all her principles, admire it:—elegance, which, whether of","Emma"
"5585",158,"person or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be","Emma"
"5586",158,"vulgar, was distinction, and merit.","Emma"
"5587",158,"","Emma"
"5588",158,"In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with","Emma"
"5589",158,"twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering","Emma"
"5590",158,"justice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer. When","Emma"
"5591",158,"she took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty;","Emma"
"5592",158,"when she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she","Emma"
"5593",158,"was going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible","Emma"
"5594",158,"to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every","Emma"
"5595",158,"well-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly","Emma"
"5596",158,"probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so","Emma"
"5597",158,"naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more","Emma"
"5598",158,"pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.","Emma"
"5599",158,"Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon’s","Emma"
"5600",158,"affections from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her","Emma"
"5601",158,"imagination had suggested at first. If it were love, it might be","Emma"
"5602",158,"simple, single, successless love on her side alone. She might have been","Emma"
"5603",158,"unconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his","Emma"
"5604",158,"conversation with her friend; and from the best, the purest of motives,","Emma"
"5605",158,"might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to","Emma"
"5606",158,"divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon","Emma"
"5607",158,"beginning her career of laborious duty.","Emma"
"5608",158,"","Emma"
"5609",158,"Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,","Emma"
"5610",158,"as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury","Emma"
"5611",158,"afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that","Emma"
"5612",158,"she could wish to scheme about for her.","Emma"
"5613",158,"","Emma"
"5614",158,"These were charming feelings—but not lasting. Before she had committed","Emma"
"5615",158,"herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane","Emma"
"5616",158,"Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and","Emma"
"5617",158,"errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, “She certainly is handsome; she","Emma"
"5618",158,"is better than handsome!” Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with","Emma"
"5619",158,"her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its","Emma"
"5620",158,"usual state. Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome","Emma"
"5621",158,"as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to","Emma"
"5622",158,"admiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of","Emma"
"5623",158,"exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how","Emma"
"5624",158,"small a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of","Emma"
"5625",158,"new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane’s","Emma"
"5626",158,"offences rose again. They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the","Emma"
"5627",158,"thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an","Emma"
"5628",158,"affectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew off","Emma"
"5629",158,"in higher style her own very superior performance. She was, besides,","Emma"
"5630",158,"which was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious! There was no getting","Emma"
"5631",158,"at her real opinion. Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed","Emma"
"5632",158,"determined to hazard nothing. She was disgustingly, was suspiciously","Emma"
"5633",158,"reserved.","Emma"
"5634",158,"","Emma"
"5635",158,"If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved","Emma"
"5636",158,"on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She seemed","Emma"
"5637",158,"bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon’s character, or her own","Emma"
"5638",158,"value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It","Emma"
"5639",158,"was all general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or","Emma"
"5640",158,"distinguished. It did her no service however. Her caution was thrown","Emma"
"5641",158,"away. Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her first surmises. There","Emma"
"5642",158,"probably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference; Mr.","Emma"
"5643",158,"Dixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for the other,","Emma"
"5644",158,"or been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve","Emma"
"5645",158,"thousand pounds.","Emma"
"5646",158,"","Emma"
"5647",158,"The like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. Frank Churchill","Emma"
"5648",158,"had been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they were a","Emma"
"5649",158,"little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma","Emma"
"5650",158,"procure as to what he truly was. “Was he handsome?”—“She believed he","Emma"
"5651",158,"was reckoned a very fine young man.” “Was he agreeable?”—“He was","Emma"
"5652",158,"generally thought so.” “Did he appear a sensible young man; a young man","Emma"
"5653",158,"of information?”—“At a watering-place, or in a common London","Emma"
"5654",158,"acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners were","Emma"
"5655",158,"all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than","Emma"
"5656",158,"they had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found his","Emma"
"5657",158,"manners pleasing.” Emma could not forgive her.","Emma"

"5663",158,"","Emma"
"5664",158,"","Emma"
"5665",158,"Emma could not forgive her;—but as neither provocation nor resentment","Emma"
"5666",158,"were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had","Emma"
"5667",158,"seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was","Emma"
"5668",158,"expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with","Emma"
"5669",158,"Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might","Emma"
"5670",158,"have done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain","Emma"
"5671",158,"enough to be very intelligible to Emma. He had been used to think her","Emma"
"5672",158,"unjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.","Emma"
"5673",158,"","Emma"
"5674",158,"“A very pleasant evening,” he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been","Emma"
"5675",158,"talked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers","Emma"
"5676",158,"swept away;—“particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us some","Emma"
"5677",158,"very good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than","Emma"
"5678",158,"sitting at one’s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such","Emma"
"5679",158,"young women; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am","Emma"
"5680",158,"sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left","Emma"
"5681",158,"nothing undone. I was glad you made her play so much, for having no","Emma"
"5682",158,"instrument at her grandmother’s, it must have been a real indulgence.”","Emma"
"5683",158,"","Emma"
"5684",158,"“I am happy you approved,” said Emma, smiling; “but I hope I am not","Emma"
"5685",158,"often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.”","Emma"
"5686",158,"","Emma"
"5687",158,"“No, my dear,” said her father instantly; “_that_ I am sure you are","Emma"
"5688",158,"not. There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any","Emma"
"5689",158,"thing, you are too attentive. The muffin last night—if it had been","Emma"
"5690",158,"handed round once, I think it would have been enough.”","Emma"
"5691",158,"","Emma"
"5692",158,"“No,” said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; “you are not often","Emma"
"5693",158,"deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension. I","Emma"
"5694",158,"think you understand me, therefore.”","Emma"
"5695",158,"","Emma"
"5696",158,"An arch look expressed—“I understand you well enough;” but she said","Emma"
"5697",158,"only, “Miss Fairfax is reserved.”","Emma"
"5698",158,"","Emma"
"5699",158,"“I always told you she was—a little; but you will soon overcome all","Emma"
"5700",158,"that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its","Emma"
"5701",158,"foundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be","Emma"
"5702",158,"honoured.”","Emma"
"5703",158,"","Emma"
"5704",158,"“You think her diffident. I do not see it.”","Emma"
"5705",158,"","Emma"
"5706",158,"“My dear Emma,” said he, moving from his chair into one close by her,","Emma"
"5707",158,"“you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant","Emma"
"5708",158,"evening.”","Emma"
"5709",158,"","Emma"
"5710",158,"“Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions;","Emma"
"5711",158,"and amused to think how little information I obtained.”","Emma"
"5712",158,"","Emma"
"5713",158,"“I am disappointed,” was his only answer.","Emma"
"5714",158,"","Emma"
"5715",158,"“I hope every body had a pleasant evening,” said Mr. Woodhouse, in his","Emma"
"5716",158,"quiet way. “I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I","Emma"
"5717",158,"moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me.","Emma"
"5718",158,"Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though","Emma"
"5719",158,"she speaks rather too quick. However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs.","Emma"
"5720",158,"Bates too, in a different way. I like old friends; and Miss Jane","Emma"
"5721",158,"Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very","Emma"
"5722",158,"well-behaved young lady indeed. She must have found the evening","Emma"
"5723",158,"agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had Emma.”","Emma"
"5724",158,"","Emma"
"5725",158,"“True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.”","Emma"
"5726",158,"","Emma"
"5727",158,"Emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the","Emma"
"5728",158,"present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question—","Emma"
"5729",158,"","Emma"
"5730",158,"“She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one’s eyes","Emma"
"5731",158,"from. I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my","Emma"
"5732",158,"heart.”","Emma"
"5733",158,"","Emma"
"5734",158,"Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to","Emma"
"5735",158,"express; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose","Emma"
"5736",158,"thoughts were on the Bates’s, said—","Emma"
"5737",158,"","Emma"
"5738",158,"“It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a","Emma"
"5739",158,"great pity indeed! and I have often wished—but it is so little one can","Emma"
"5740",158,"venture to do—small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon—Now we","Emma"
"5741",158,"have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg;","Emma"
"5742",158,"it is very small and delicate—Hartfield pork is not like any other","Emma"
"5743",158,"pork—but still it is pork—and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sure","Emma"
"5744",158,"of their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried,","Emma"
"5745",158,"without the smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear","Emma"
"5746",158,"roast pork—I think we had better send the leg—do not you think so, my","Emma"
"5747",158,"dear?”","Emma"
"5748",158,"","Emma"
"5749",158,"“My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.","Emma"
"5750",158,"There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice,","Emma"
"5751",158,"and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.”","Emma"
"5752",158,"","Emma"
"5753",158,"“That’s right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, but","Emma"
"5754",158,"that is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it","Emma"
"5755",158,"is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle","Emma"
"5756",158,"boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a","Emma"
"5757",158,"little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.”","Emma"
"5758",158,"","Emma"
"5759",158,"“Emma,” said Mr. Knightley presently, “I have a piece of news for you.","Emma"
"5760",158,"You like news—and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will","Emma"
"5761",158,"interest you.”","Emma"
"5762",158,"","Emma"
"5763",158,"“News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?—why do you smile","Emma"
"5764",158,"so?—where did you hear it?—at Randalls?”","Emma"
"5765",158,"","Emma"
"5766",158,"He had time only to say,","Emma"
"5767",158,"","Emma"
"5768",158,"“No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,” when the door was","Emma"
"5769",158,"thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room. Full","Emma"
"5770",158,"of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give","Emma"
"5771",158,"quickest. Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that","Emma"
"5772",158,"not another syllable of communication could rest with him.","Emma"
"5773",158,"","Emma"
"5774",158,"“Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse—I","Emma"
"5775",158,"come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! You are","Emma"
"5776",158,"too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to be","Emma"
"5777",158,"married.”","Emma"
"5778",158,"","Emma"
"5779",158,"Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was so","Emma"
"5780",158,"completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a","Emma"
"5781",158,"little blush, at the sound.","Emma"
"5782",158,"","Emma"
"5783",158,"“There is my news:—I thought it would interest you,” said Mr.","Emma"
"5784",158,"Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what","Emma"
"5785",158,"had passed between them.","Emma"
"5786",158,"","Emma"
"5787",158,"“But where could _you_ hear it?” cried Miss Bates. “Where could you","Emma"
"5788",158,"possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since I","Emma"
"5789",158,"received Mrs. Cole’s note—no, it cannot be more than five—or at least","Emma"
"5790",158,"ten—for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come out—I","Emma"
"5791",158,"was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork—Jane was","Emma"
"5792",158,"standing in the passage—were not you, Jane?—for my mother was so afraid","Emma"
"5793",158,"that we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I would go down","Emma"
"5794",158,"and see, and Jane said, ‘Shall I go down instead? for I think you have","Emma"
"5795",158,"a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.’—‘Oh! my dear,’","Emma"
"5796",158,"said I—well, and just then came the note. A Miss Hawkins—that’s all I","Emma"
"5797",158,"know. A Miss Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley, how could you","Emma"
"5798",158,"possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of","Emma"
"5799",158,"it, she sat down and wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins—”","Emma"
"5800",158,"","Emma"
"5801",158,"“I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He had just","Emma"
"5802",158,"read Elton’s letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly.”","Emma"
"5803",158,"","Emma"
"5804",158,"“Well! that is quite—I suppose there never was a piece of news more","Emma"
"5805",158,"generally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. My","Emma"
"5806",158,"mother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a thousand","Emma"
"5807",158,"thanks, and says you really quite oppress her.”","Emma"
"5808",158,"","Emma"
"5809",158,"“We consider our Hartfield pork,” replied Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed it","Emma"
"5810",158,"certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I","Emma"
"5811",158,"cannot have a greater pleasure than—”","Emma"
"5812",158,"","Emma"
"5813",158,"“Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good to","Emma"
"5814",158,"us. If ever there were people who, without having great wealth","Emma"
"5815",158,"themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us. We","Emma"
"5816",158,"may well say that ‘our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.’ Well, Mr.","Emma"
"5817",158,"Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well—”","Emma"
"5818",158,"","Emma"
"5819",158,"“It was short—merely to announce—but cheerful, exulting, of course.”—","Emma"
"5820",158,"Here was a sly glance at Emma. “He had been so fortunate as to—I forget","Emma"
"5821",158,"the precise words—one has no business to remember them. The information","Emma"
"5822",158,"was, as you state, that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins.","Emma"
"5823",158,"By his style, I should imagine it just settled.”","Emma"
"5824",158,"","Emma"
"5825",158,"“Mr. Elton going to be married!” said Emma, as soon as she could speak.","Emma"
"5826",158,"“He will have every body’s wishes for his happiness.”","Emma"
"5827",158,"","Emma"
"5828",158,"“He is very young to settle,” was Mr. Woodhouse’s observation. “He had","Emma"
"5829",158,"better not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well off as he was. We","Emma"
"5830",158,"were always glad to see him at Hartfield.”","Emma"
"5831",158,"","Emma"
"5832",158,"“A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!” said Miss Bates,","Emma"
"5833",158,"joyfully; “my mother is so pleased!—she says she cannot bear to have","Emma"
"5834",158,"the poor old Vicarage without a mistress. This is great news, indeed.","Emma"
"5835",158,"Jane, you have never seen Mr. Elton!—no wonder that you have such a","Emma"
"5836",158,"curiosity to see him.”","Emma"
"5837",158,"","Emma"
"5838",158,"Jane’s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to","Emma"
"5839",158,"occupy her.","Emma"
"5840",158,"","Emma"
"5841",158,"“No—I have never seen Mr. Elton,” she replied, starting on this appeal;","Emma"
"5842",158,"“is he—is he a tall man?”","Emma"
"5843",158,"","Emma"
"5844",158,"“Who shall answer that question?” cried Emma. “My father would say","Emma"
"5845",158,"‘yes,’ Mr. Knightley ‘no;’ and Miss Bates and I that he is just the","Emma"
"5846",158,"happy medium. When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax,","Emma"
"5847",158,"you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in","Emma"
"5848",158,"Highbury, both in person and mind.”","Emma"
"5849",158,"","Emma"
"5850",158,"“Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the very best young","Emma"
"5851",158,"man—But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he was","Emma"
"5852",158,"precisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,—I dare say, an","Emma"
"5853",158,"excellent young woman. His extreme attention to my mother—wanting her","Emma"
"5854",158,"to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for my","Emma"
"5855",158,"mother is a little deaf, you know—it is not much, but she does not hear","Emma"
"5856",158,"quite quick. Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. He","Emma"
"5857",158,"fancied bathing might be good for it—the warm bath—but she says it did","Emma"
"5858",158,"him no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite our angel.","Emma"
"5859",158,"And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy of him. It","Emma"
"5860",158,"is such a happiness when good people get together—and they always do.","Emma"
"5861",158,"Now, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles,","Emma"
"5862",158,"such very good people; and the Perrys—I suppose there never was a","Emma"
"5863",158,"happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir,”","Emma"
"5864",158,"turning to Mr. Woodhouse, “I think there are few places with such","Emma"
"5865",158,"society as Highbury. I always say, we are quite blessed in our","Emma"
"5866",158,"neighbours.—My dear sir, if there is one thing my mother loves better","Emma"
"5867",158,"than another, it is pork—a roast loin of pork—”","Emma"
"5868",158,"","Emma"
"5869",158,"“As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been acquainted","Emma"
"5870",158,"with her,” said Emma, “nothing I suppose can be known. One feels that","Emma"
"5871",158,"it cannot be a very long acquaintance. He has been gone only four","Emma"
"5872",158,"weeks.”","Emma"
"5873",158,"","Emma"
"5874",158,"Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,","Emma"
"5875",158,"Emma said,","Emma"
"5876",158,"","Emma"
"5877",158,"“You are silent, Miss Fairfax—but I hope you mean to take an interest","Emma"
"5878",158,"in this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on","Emma"
"5879",158,"these subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on Miss","Emma"
"5880",158,"Campbell’s account—we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr.","Emma"
"5881",158,"Elton and Miss Hawkins.”","Emma"
"5882",158,"","Emma"
"5883",158,"“When I have seen Mr. Elton,” replied Jane, “I dare say I shall be","Emma"
"5884",158,"interested—but I believe it requires _that_ with me. And as it is some","Emma"
"5885",158,"months since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little worn","Emma"
"5886",158,"off.”","Emma"
"5887",158,"","Emma"
"5888",158,"“Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss","Emma"
"5889",158,"Woodhouse,” said Miss Bates, “four weeks yesterday.—A Miss","Emma"
"5890",158,"Hawkins!—Well, I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady","Emma"
"5891",158,"hereabouts; not that I ever—Mrs. Cole once whispered to me—but I","Emma"
"5892",158,"immediately said, ‘No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man—but’—In","Emma"
"5893",158,"short, I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of","Emma"
"5894",158,"discoveries. I do not pretend to it. What is before me, I see. At the","Emma"
"5895",158,"same time, nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired—Miss","Emma"
"5896",158,"Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She knows I would not","Emma"
"5897",158,"offend for the world. How does Miss Smith do? She seems quite recovered","Emma"
"5898",158,"now. Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately? Oh! those dear","Emma"
"5899",158,"little children. Jane, do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr.","Emma"
"5900",158,"John Knightley. I mean in person—tall, and with that sort of look—and","Emma"
"5901",158,"not very talkative.”","Emma"
"5902",158,"","Emma"
"5903",158,"“Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.”","Emma"
"5904",158,"","Emma"
"5905",158,"“Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.","Emma"
"5906",158,"One takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon, you say, is","Emma"
"5907",158,"not, strictly speaking, handsome?”","Emma"
"5908",158,"","Emma"
"5909",158,"“Handsome! Oh! no—far from it—certainly plain. I told you he was","Emma"
"5910",158,"plain.”","Emma"
"5911",158,"","Emma"
"5912",158,"“My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,","Emma"
"5913",158,"and that you yourself—”","Emma"
"5914",158,"","Emma"
"5915",158,"“Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard, I","Emma"
"5916",158,"always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the","Emma"
"5917",158,"general opinion, when I called him plain.”","Emma"
"5918",158,"","Emma"
"5919",158,"“Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather","Emma"
"5920",158,"does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging,","Emma"
"5921",158,"my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a","Emma"
"5922",158,"most agreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs.","Emma"
"5923",158,"Cole’s; but I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better","Emma"
"5924",158,"go home directly—I would not have you out in a shower!—We think she is","Emma"
"5925",158,"the better for Highbury already. Thank you, we do indeed. I shall not","Emma"
"5926",158,"attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she cares","Emma"
"5927",158,"for any thing but _boiled_ pork: when we dress the leg it will be","Emma"
"5928",158,"another thing. Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is","Emma"
"5929",158,"coming too. Well, that is so very!—I am sure if Jane is tired, you will","Emma"
"5930",158,"be so kind as to give her your arm.—Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!—Good","Emma"
"5931",158,"morning to you.”","Emma"
"5932",158,"","Emma"
"5933",158,"Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him while","Emma"
"5934",158,"he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry—and to","Emma"
"5935",158,"marry strangers too—and the other half she could give to her own view","Emma"
"5936",158,"of the subject. It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece","Emma"
"5937",158,"of news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but","Emma"
"5938",158,"she was sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it—and all that she could","Emma"
"5939",158,"hope was, by giving the first information herself, to save her from","Emma"
"5940",158,"hearing it abruptly from others. It was now about the time that she was","Emma"
"5941",158,"likely to call. If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!—and upon its","Emma"
"5942",158,"beginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be","Emma"
"5943",158,"detaining her at Mrs. Goddard’s, and that the intelligence would","Emma"
"5944",158,"undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.","Emma"
"5945",158,"","Emma"
"5946",158,"The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,","Emma"
"5947",158,"when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which","Emma"
"5948",158,"hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the “Oh!","Emma"
"5949",158,"Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!” which instantly burst","Emma"
"5950",158,"forth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. As the blow","Emma"
"5951",158,"was given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than","Emma"
"5952",158,"in listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had","Emma"
"5953",158,"to tell. “She had set out from Mrs. Goddard’s half an hour ago—she had","Emma"
"5954",158,"been afraid it would rain—she had been afraid it would pour down every","Emma"
"5955",158,"moment—but she thought she might get to Hartfield first—she had hurried","Emma"
"5956",158,"on as fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by the house where","Emma"
"5957",158,"a young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she would just","Emma"
"5958",158,"step in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay","Emma"
"5959",158,"half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain, and she","Emma"
"5960",158,"did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as she could,","Emma"
"5961",158,"and took shelter at Ford’s.”—Ford’s was the principal woollen-draper,","Emma"
"5962",158,"linen-draper, and haberdasher’s shop united; the shop first in size and","Emma"
"5963",158,"fashion in the place.—“And so, there she had set, without an idea of","Emma"
"5964",158,"any thing in the world, full ten minutes, perhaps—when, all of a","Emma"
"5965",158,"sudden, who should come in—to be sure it was so very odd!—but they","Emma"
"5966",158,"always dealt at Ford’s—who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her","Emma"
"5967",158,"brother!—Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. I thought I should have","Emma"
"5968",158,"fainted. I did not know what to do. I was sitting near the","Emma"
"5969",158,"door—Elizabeth saw me directly; but he did not; he was busy with the","Emma"
"5970",158,"umbrella. I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took","Emma"
"5971",158,"no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop; and","Emma"
"5972",158,"I kept sitting near the door!—Oh! dear; I was so miserable! I am sure I","Emma"
"5973",158,"must have been as white as my gown. I could not go away you know,","Emma"
"5974",158,"because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but","Emma"
"5975",158,"there.—Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse—well, at last, I fancy, he looked round","Emma"
"5976",158,"and saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, they began","Emma"
"5977",158,"whispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; and I","Emma"
"5978",158,"could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me—(do","Emma"
"5979",158,"you think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)—for presently she came forward—came","Emma"
"5980",158,"quite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake","Emma"
"5981",158,"hands, if I would. She did not do any of it in the same way that she","Emma"
"5982",158,"used; I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to","Emma"
"5983",158,"be very friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but","Emma"
"5984",158,"I know no more what I said—I was in such a tremble!—I remember she said","Emma"
"5985",158,"she was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear,","Emma"
"5986",158,"Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was","Emma"
"5987",158,"beginning to hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me","Emma"
"5988",158,"from getting away—and then—only think!—I found he was coming up towards","Emma"
"5989",158,"me too—slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and","Emma"
"5990",158,"so he came and spoke, and I answered—and I stood for a minute, feeling","Emma"
"5991",158,"dreadfully, you know, one can’t tell how; and then I took courage, and","Emma"
"5992",158,"said it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not","Emma"
"5993",158,"got three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I","Emma"
"5994",158,"was going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr.","Emma"
"5995",158,"Cole’s stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this","Emma"
"5996",158,"rain. Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I","Emma"
"5997",158,"said, I was very much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and","Emma"
"5998",158,"then he went back to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables—I","Emma"
"5999",158,"believe I did—but I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh!","Emma"
"6000",158,"Miss Woodhouse, I would rather done any thing than have it happen: and","Emma"
"6001",158,"yet, you know, there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so","Emma"
"6002",158,"pleasantly and so kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do","Emma"
"6003",158,"talk to me and make me comfortable again.”","Emma"
"6004",158,"","Emma"
"6005",158,"Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in","Emma"
"6006",158,"her power. She was obliged to stop and think. She was not thoroughly","Emma"
"6007",158,"comfortable herself. The young man’s conduct, and his sister’s, seemed","Emma"
"6008",158,"the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them. As Harriet","Emma"
"6009",158,"described it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded","Emma"
"6010",158,"affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she had believed","Emma"
"6011",158,"them to be well-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did","Emma"
"6012",158,"this make in the evils of the connexion? It was folly to be disturbed","Emma"
"6013",158,"by it. Of course, he must be sorry to lose her—they must be all sorry.","Emma"
"6014",158,"Ambition, as well as love, had probably been mortified. They might all","Emma"
"6015",158,"have hoped to rise by Harriet’s acquaintance: and besides, what was the","Emma"
"6016",158,"value of Harriet’s description?—So easily pleased—so little","Emma"
"6017",158,"discerning;—what signified her praise?","Emma"
"6018",158,"","Emma"
"6019",158,"She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by","Emma"
"6020",158,"considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of","Emma"
"6021",158,"being dwelt on,","Emma"
"6022",158,"","Emma"
"6023",158,"“It might be distressing, for the moment,” said she; “but you seem to","Emma"
"6024",158,"have behaved extremely well; and it is over—and may never—can never, as","Emma"
"6025",158,"a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about","Emma"
"6026",158,"it.”","Emma"
"6027",158,"","Emma"
"6028",158,"Harriet said, “very true,” and she “would not think about it;” but","Emma"
"6029",158,"still she talked of it—still she could talk of nothing else; and Emma,","Emma"
"6030",158,"at last, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged to","Emma"
"6031",158,"hurry on the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender","Emma"
"6032",158,"caution; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed","Emma"
"6033",158,"or only amused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet—such a","Emma"
"6034",158,"conclusion of Mr. Elton’s importance with her!","Emma"
"6035",158,"","Emma"
"6036",158,"Mr. Elton’s rights, however, gradually revived. Though she did not feel","Emma"
"6037",158,"the first intelligence as she might have done the day before, or an","Emma"
"6038",158,"hour before, its interest soon increased; and before their first","Emma"
"6039",158,"conversation was over, she had talked herself into all the sensations","Emma"
"6040",158,"of curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to this","Emma"
"6041",158,"fortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place the Martins under","Emma"
"6042",158,"proper subordination in her fancy.","Emma"
"6043",158,"","Emma"
"6044",158,"Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. It","Emma"
"6045",158,"had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining","Emma"
"6046",158,"any influence to alarm. As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not get","Emma"
"6047",158,"at her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted either the","Emma"
"6048",158,"courage or the condescension to seek her; for since her refusal of the","Emma"
"6049",158,"brother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard’s; and a","Emma"
"6050",158,"twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again, with","Emma"

"6076",158,"another as superior, of course, to the first, as under such","Emma"
"6077",158,"circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost. He came back","Emma"
"6078",158,"gay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for Miss","Emma"
"6079",158,"Woodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.","Emma"
"6080",158,"","Emma"
"6081",158,"The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages","Emma"
"6082",158,"of perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent","Emma"
"6083",158,"fortune, of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of","Emma"
"6084",158,"some dignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well; he had","Emma"
"6085",158,"not thrown himself away—he had gained a woman of 10,000 _l_. or","Emma"
"6086",158,"thereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity—the","Emma"
"6087",158,"first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by","Emma"
"6088",158,"distinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole of","Emma"
"6089",158,"the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious—the steps so quick,","Emma"
"6090",158,"from the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green’s, and the","Emma"
"6091",158,"party at Mrs. Brown’s—smiles and blushes rising in importance—with","Emma"
"6092",158,"consciousness and agitation richly scattered—the lady had been so","Emma"
"6093",158,"easily impressed—so sweetly disposed—had in short, to use a most","Emma"
"6094",158,"intelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him, that vanity and","Emma"
"6095",158,"prudence were equally contented.","Emma"
"6096",158,"","Emma"
"6097",158,"He had caught both substance and shadow—both fortune and affection, and","Emma"
"6098",158,"was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself and his","Emma"
"6099",158,"own concerns—expecting to be congratulated—ready to be laughed at—and,","Emma"
"6100",158,"with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young ladies of","Emma"
"6101",158,"the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been more cautiously","Emma"
"6102",158,"gallant.","Emma"
"6103",158,"","Emma"
"6104",158,"The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves to","Emma"
"6105",158,"please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and","Emma"
"6106",158,"when he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, which","Emma"
"6107",158,"a certain glance of Mrs. Cole’s did not seem to contradict, that when","Emma"
"6108",158,"he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride.","Emma"
"6109",158,"","Emma"
"6110",158,"During his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just","Emma"
"6111",158,"enough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her the","Emma"
"6112",158,"impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and","Emma"
"6113",158,"pretension, now spread over his air. She was, in fact, beginning very","Emma"
"6114",158,"much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all; and his","Emma"
"6115",158,"sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable","Emma"
"6116",158,"feelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a","Emma"
"6117",158,"source of profitable humiliation to her own mind, she would have been","Emma"
"6118",158,"thankful to be assured of never seeing him again. She wished him very","Emma"
"6119",158,"well; but he gave her pain, and his welfare twenty miles off would","Emma"
"6120",158,"administer most satisfaction.","Emma"
"6121",158,"","Emma"
"6122",158,"The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must","Emma"
"6123",158,"certainly be lessened by his marriage. Many vain solicitudes would be","Emma"
"6124",158,"prevented—many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would be","Emma"
"6125",158,"an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink","Emma"
"6126",158,"without remark. It would be almost beginning their life of civility","Emma"
"6127",158,"again.","Emma"
"6128",158,"","Emma"
"6129",158,"Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She was good","Emma"
"6130",158,"enough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for","Emma"
"6131",158,"Highbury—handsome enough—to look plain, probably, by Harriet’s side. As","Emma"
"6132",158,"to connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all","Emma"
"6133",158,"his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. On","Emma"
"6134",158,"that article, truth seemed attainable. _What_ she was, must be","Emma"
"6135",158,"uncertain; but _who_ she was, might be found out; and setting aside the","Emma"
"6136",158,"10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at all Harriet’s superior.","Emma"
"6137",158,"She brought no name, no blood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the","Emma"
"6138",158,"youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol—merchant, of course, he must","Emma"
"6139",158,"be called; but, as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life","Emma"
"6140",158,"appeared so very moderate, it was not unfair to guess the dignity of","Emma"
"6141",158,"his line of trade had been very moderate also. Part of every winter she","Emma"
"6142",158,"had been used to spend in Bath; but Bristol was her home, the very","Emma"
"6143",158,"heart of Bristol; for though the father and mother had died some years","Emma"
"6144",158,"ago, an uncle remained—in the law line—nothing more distinctly","Emma"
"6145",158,"honourable was hazarded of him, than that he was in the law line; and","Emma"
"6146",158,"with him the daughter had lived. Emma guessed him to be the drudge of","Emma"
"6147",158,"some attorney, and too stupid to rise. And all the grandeur of the","Emma"
"6148",158,"connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was _very_ _well_","Emma"
"6149",158,"_married_, to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_, near Bristol, who kept","Emma"
"6150",158,"two carriages! That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory","Emma"
"6151",158,"of Miss Hawkins.","Emma"
"6152",158,"","Emma"
"6153",158,"Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She had","Emma"
"6154",158,"talked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked out","Emma"
"6155",158,"of it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet’s","Emma"
"6156",158,"mind was not to be talked away. He might be superseded by another; he","Emma"
"6157",158,"certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin","Emma"
"6158",158,"would have been sufficient; but nothing else, she feared, would cure","Emma"
"6159",158,"her. Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always","Emma"
"6160",158,"in love. And now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from this","Emma"
"6161",158,"reappearance of Mr. Elton. She was always having a glimpse of him","Emma"
"6162",158,"somewhere or other. Emma saw him only once; but two or three times","Emma"
"6163",158,"every day Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him, or _just_ to miss","Emma"
"6164",158,"him, _just_ to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, _just_ to have","Emma"
"6165",158,"something occur to preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring","Emma"
"6166",158,"warmth of surprize and conjecture. She was, moreover, perpetually","Emma"
"6167",158,"hearing about him; for, excepting when at Hartfield, she was always","Emma"
"6168",158,"among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so","Emma"
"6169",158,"interesting as the discussion of his concerns; and every report,","Emma"
"6170",158,"therefore, every guess—all that had already occurred, all that might","Emma"
"6171",158,"occur in the arrangement of his affairs, comprehending income,","Emma"
"6172",158,"servants, and furniture, was continually in agitation around her. Her","Emma"
"6173",158,"regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her","Emma"
"6174",158,"regrets kept alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of","Emma"
"6175",158,"Miss Hawkins’s happiness, and continual observation of, how much he","Emma"
"6176",158,"seemed attached!—his air as he walked by the house—the very sitting of","Emma"
"6177",158,"his hat, being all in proof of how much he was in love!","Emma"
"6178",158,"","Emma"
"6179",158,"Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her","Emma"
"6180",158,"friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet’s mind,","Emma"
"6181",158,"Emma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Elton","Emma"
"6182",158,"predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful","Emma"
"6183",158,"as a check to the other. Mr. Elton’s engagement had been the cure of","Emma"
"6184",158,"the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by the","Emma"
"6185",158,"knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth","Emma"
"6186",158,"Martin’s calling at Mrs. Goddard’s a few days afterwards. Harriet had","Emma"
"6187",158,"not been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her,","Emma"
"6188",158,"written in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a","Emma"
"6189",158,"great deal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had","Emma"
"6190",158,"been much occupied by it, continually pondering over what could be done","Emma"
"6191",158,"in return, and wishing to do more than she dared to confess. But Mr.","Emma"
"6192",158,"Elton, in person, had driven away all such cares. While he staid, the","Emma"
"6193",158,"Martins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off for","Emma"
"6194",158,"Bath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned,","Emma"
"6195",158,"judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin’s visit.","Emma"
"6196",158,"","Emma"
"6197",158,"How that visit was to be acknowledged—what would be necessary—and what","Emma"
"6198",158,"might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration.","Emma"
"6199",158,"Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would","Emma"
"6200",158,"be ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the","Emma"
"6201",158,"acquaintance—!","Emma"
"6202",158,"","Emma"
"6203",158,"After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than","Emma"
"6204",158,"Harriet’s returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had","Emma"
"6205",158,"understanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal","Emma"
"6206",158,"acquaintance. She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the","Emma"
"6207",158,"Abbey Mill, while she drove a little farther, and call for her again so","Emma"
"6208",158,"soon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous","Emma"
"6209",158,"recurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degree","Emma"
"6210",158,"of intimacy was chosen for the future.","Emma"
"6211",158,"","Emma"
"6212",158,"She could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it","Emma"
"6213",158,"which her own heart could not approve—something of ingratitude, merely","Emma"
"6214",158,"glossed over—it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?","Emma"

"6219",158,"CHAPTER V","Emma"
"6220",158,"","Emma"
"6221",158,"","Emma"
"6222",158,"Small heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before her","Emma"
"6223",158,"friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard’s, her evil stars had led her to","Emma"
"6224",158,"the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to _The Rev.","Emma"
"6225",158,"Philip Elton, White-Hart, Bath_, was to be seen under the operation of","Emma"
"6226",158,"being lifted into the butcher’s cart, which was to convey it to where","Emma"
"6227",158,"the coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk","Emma"
"6228",158,"and the direction, was consequently a blank.","Emma"
"6229",158,"","Emma"
"6230",158,"She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to be","Emma"
"6231",158,"put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between","Emma"
"6232",158,"espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which","Emma"
"6233",158,"had given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to","Emma"
"6234",158,"revive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed","Emma"
"6235",158,"her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which","Emma"
"6236",158,"determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of","Emma"
"6237",158,"an hour. She went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old","Emma"
"6238",158,"servant who was married, and settled in Donwell.","Emma"
"6239",158,"","Emma"
"6240",158,"The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;","Emma"
"6241",158,"and Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay, and","Emma"
"6242",158,"unattended by any alarming young man. She came solitarily down the","Emma"
"6243",158,"gravel walk—a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with","Emma"
"6244",158,"her seemingly with ceremonious civility.","Emma"
"6245",158,"","Emma"
"6246",158,"Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She was","Emma"
"6247",158,"feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough to","Emma"
"6248",158,"understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating.","Emma"
"6249",158,"She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received her","Emma"
"6250",158,"doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace","Emma"
"6251",158,"had been talked almost all the time—till just at last, when Mrs.","Emma"
"6252",158,"Martin’s saying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was","Emma"
"6253",158,"grown, had brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner.","Emma"
"6254",158,"In that very room she had been measured last September, with her two","Emma"
"6255",158,"friends. There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot","Emma"
"6256",158,"by the window. _He_ had done it. They all seemed to remember the day,","Emma"
"6257",158,"the hour, the party, the occasion—to feel the same consciousness, the","Emma"
"6258",158,"same regrets—to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and","Emma"
"6259",158,"they were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must","Emma"
"6260",158,"suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,) when","Emma"
"6261",158,"the carriage reappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and","Emma"
"6262",158,"the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to","Emma"
"6263",158,"be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six","Emma"
"6264",158,"months ago!—Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they","Emma"
"6265",158,"might resent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business.","Emma"
"6266",158,"She would have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had","Emma"
"6267",158,"the Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so deserving, that a","Emma"
"6268",158,"_little_ higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could she","Emma"
"6269",158,"have done otherwise?—Impossible!—She could not repent. They must be","Emma"
"6270",158,"separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process—so much to","Emma"
"6271",158,"herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a little","Emma"
"6272",158,"consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure","Emma"
"6273",158,"it. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The","Emma"
"6274",158,"refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.","Emma"
"6275",158,"","Emma"
"6276",158,"It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that","Emma"
"6277",158,"neither “master nor mistress was at home;” they had both been out some","Emma"
"6278",158,"time; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.","Emma"
"6279",158,"","Emma"
"6280",158,"“This is too bad,” cried Emma, as they turned away. “And now we shall","Emma"
"6281",158,"just miss them; too provoking!—I do not know when I have been so","Emma"
"6282",158,"disappointed.” And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her","Emma"
"6283",158,"murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both—such being","Emma"
"6284",158,"the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the","Emma"
"6285",158,"carriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who","Emma"
"6286",158,"were standing to speak to her. There was instant pleasure in the sight","Emma"
"6287",158,"of them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound—for Mr.","Emma"
"6288",158,"Weston immediately accosted her with,","Emma"
"6289",158,"","Emma"
"6290",158,"“How d’ye do?—how d’ye do?—We have been sitting with your father—glad","Emma"
"6291",158,"to see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow—I had a letter this","Emma"
"6292",158,"morning—we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty—he is at","Emma"
"6293",158,"Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be","Emma"
"6294",158,"so. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; I","Emma"
"6295",158,"was always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have","Emma"
"6296",158,"just the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shall","Emma"
"6297",158,"enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could","Emma"
"6298",158,"wish.”","Emma"
"6299",158,"","Emma"
"6300",158,"There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the","Emma"
"6301",158,"influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston’s, confirmed as it all was","Emma"
"6302",158,"by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but","Emma"
"6303",158,"not less to the purpose. To know that _she_ thought his coming certain","Emma"
"6304",158,"was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice","Emma"
"6305",158,"in their joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted","Emma"
"6306",158,"spirits. The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was","Emma"
"6307",158,"coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment’s thought, she hoped Mr.","Emma"
"6308",158,"Elton would now be talked of no more.","Emma"
"6309",158,"","Emma"
"6310",158,"Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which","Emma"
"6311",158,"allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his","Emma"
"6312",158,"command, as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she","Emma"
"6313",158,"listened, and smiled, and congratulated.","Emma"
"6314",158,"","Emma"
"6315",158,"“I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,” said he, at the conclusion.","Emma"
"6316",158,"","Emma"
"6317",158,"Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his","Emma"
"6318",158,"wife.","Emma"
"6319",158,"","Emma"
"6320",158,"“We had better move on, Mr. Weston,” said she, “we are detaining the","Emma"
"6321",158,"girls.”","Emma"
"6322",158,"","Emma"
"6323",158,"“Well, well, I am ready;”—and turning again to Emma, “but you must not","Emma"
"6324",158,"be expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have only had _my_","Emma"
"6325",158,"account you know; I dare say he is really nothing","Emma"
"6326",158,"extraordinary:”—though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were","Emma"
"6327",158,"speaking a very different conviction.","Emma"
"6328",158,"","Emma"
"6329",158,"Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a","Emma"
"6330",158,"manner that appropriated nothing.","Emma"
"6331",158,"","Emma"
"6332",158,"“Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o’clock,” was Mrs.","Emma"
"6333",158,"Weston’s parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only","Emma"
"6334",158,"for her.","Emma"
"6335",158,"","Emma"
"6336",158,"“Four o’clock!—depend upon it he will be here by three,” was Mr.","Emma"
"6337",158,"Weston’s quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.","Emma"
"6338",158,"Emma’s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore a","Emma"
"6339",158,"different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as","Emma"
"6340",158,"before. When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at least","Emma"
"6341",158,"must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she saw","Emma"
"6342",158,"something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.","Emma"
"6343",158,"","Emma"
"6344",158,"“Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?”—was a","Emma"
"6345",158,"question, however, which did not augur much.","Emma"
"6346",158,"","Emma"
"6347",158,"But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma","Emma"
"6348",158,"was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.","Emma"
"6349",158,"","Emma"
"6350",158,"The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston’s faithful","Emma"
"6351",158,"pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o’clock, that","Emma"
"6352",158,"she was to think of her at four.","Emma"
"6353",158,"","Emma"
"6354",158,"“My dear, dear anxious friend,”—said she, in mental soliloquy, while","Emma"
"6355",158,"walking downstairs from her own room, “always overcareful for every","Emma"
"6356",158,"body’s comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little fidgets,","Emma"
"6357",158,"going again and again into his room, to be sure that all is right.” The","Emma"
"6358",158,"clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall. “’Tis twelve; I","Emma"
"6359",158,"shall not forget to think of you four hours hence; and by this time","Emma"
"6360",158,"to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of the","Emma"
"6361",158,"possibility of their all calling here. I am sure they will bring him","Emma"
"6362",158,"soon.”","Emma"
"6363",158,"","Emma"
"6364",158,"She opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her","Emma"
"6365",158,"father—Mr. Weston and his son. They had been arrived only a few","Emma"
"6366",158,"minutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of","Emma"
"6367",158,"Frank’s being a day before his time, and her father was yet in the","Emma"
"6368",158,"midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared,","Emma"
"6369",158,"to have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.","Emma"
"6370",158,"","Emma"
"6371",158,"The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was","Emma"
"6372",158,"actually before her—he was presented to her, and she did not think too","Emma"
"6373",158,"much had been said in his praise; he was a _very_ good looking young","Emma"
"6374",158,"man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his","Emma"
"6375",158,"countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his","Emma"
"6376",158,"father’s; he looked quick and sensible. She felt immediately that she","Emma"
"6377",158,"should like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and a","Emma"
"6378",158,"readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending to be","Emma"
"6379",158,"acquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.","Emma"
"6380",158,"","Emma"
"6381",158,"He had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with the","Emma"
"6382",158,"eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travel","Emma"
"6383",158,"earlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day.","Emma"
"6384",158,"","Emma"
"6385",158,"“I told you yesterday,” cried Mr. Weston with exultation, “I told you","Emma"
"6386",158,"all that he would be here before the time named. I remembered what I","Emma"
"6387",158,"used to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help","Emma"
"6388",158,"getting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in","Emma"
"6389",158,"upon one’s friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal","Emma"
"6390",158,"more than any little exertion it needs.”","Emma"
"6391",158,"","Emma"
"6392",158,"“It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,” said the young","Emma"
"6393",158,"man, “though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;","Emma"
"6394",158,"but in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.”","Emma"
"6395",158,"","Emma"
"6396",158,"The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency.","Emma"
"6397",158,"Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the","Emma"
"6398",158,"conviction was strengthened by what followed. He was very much pleased","Emma"
"6399",158,"with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly","Emma"
"6400",158,"allow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to","Emma"
"6401",158,"Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself","Emma"
"6402",158,"to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but","Emma"
"6403",158,"one’s _own_ country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. That","Emma"
"6404",158,"he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before,","Emma"
"6405",158,"passed suspiciously through Emma’s brain; but still, if it were a","Emma"
"6406",158,"falsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His manner","Emma"
"6407",158,"had no air of study or exaggeration. He did really look and speak as if","Emma"
"6408",158,"in a state of no common enjoyment.","Emma"
"6409",158,"","Emma"
"6410",158,"Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening","Emma"
"6411",158,"acquaintance. On his side were the inquiries,—“Was she a","Emma"
"6412",158,"horsewoman?—Pleasant rides?—Pleasant walks?—Had they a large","Emma"
"6413",158,"neighbourhood?—Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?—There were","Emma"
"6414",158,"several very pretty houses in and about it.—Balls—had they balls?—Was","Emma"
"6415",158,"it a musical society?”","Emma"
"6416",158,"","Emma"
"6417",158,"But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance","Emma"
"6418",158,"proportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, while","Emma"
"6419",158,"their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his","Emma"
"6420",158,"mother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, so","Emma"
"6421",158,"much warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she secured","Emma"
"6422",158,"to his father, and her very kind reception of himself, as was an","Emma"
"6423",158,"additional proof of his knowing how to please—and of his certainly","Emma"
"6424",158,"thinking it worth while to try to please her. He did not advance a word","Emma"
"6425",158,"of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs.","Emma"
"6426",158,"Weston; but, undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. He","Emma"
"6427",158,"understood what would be welcome; he could be sure of little else. “His","Emma"
"6428",158,"father’s marriage,” he said, “had been the wisest measure, every friend","Emma"
"6429",158,"must rejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a","Emma"
"6430",158,"blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest","Emma"
"6431",158,"obligation on him.”","Emma"
"6432",158,"","Emma"
"6433",158,"He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor’s merits,","Emma"
"6434",158,"without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it","Emma"
"6435",158,"was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse’s","Emma"
"6436",158,"character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor’s. And at last, as if","Emma"
"6437",158,"resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its","Emma"
"6438",158,"object, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of","Emma"
"6439",158,"her person.","Emma"
"6440",158,"","Emma"
"6441",158,"“Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,” said he; “but I","Emma"
"6442",158,"confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a","Emma"
"6443",158,"very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that","Emma"
"6444",158,"I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.”","Emma"
"6445",158,"","Emma"
"6446",158,"“You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,”","Emma"
"6447",158,"said Emma; “were you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen","Emma"
"6448",158,"with pleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using","Emma"
"6449",158,"such words. Don’t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a","Emma"
"6450",158,"pretty young woman.”","Emma"
"6451",158,"","Emma"
"6452",158,"“I hope I should know better,” he replied; “no, depend upon it, (with a","Emma"
"6453",158,"gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I","Emma"
"6454",158,"might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my","Emma"
"6455",158,"terms.”","Emma"
"6456",158,"","Emma"
"6457",158,"Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from","Emma"
"6458",158,"their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her","Emma"
"6459",158,"mind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be","Emma"
"6460",158,"considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She must","Emma"
"6461",158,"see more of him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they","Emma"
"6462",158,"were agreeable.","Emma"
"6463",158,"","Emma"
"6464",158,"She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. His quick","Emma"
"6465",158,"eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy","Emma"
"6466",158,"expression; and even, when he might have determined not to look, she","Emma"
"6467",158,"was confident that he was often listening.","Emma"
"6468",158,"","Emma"
"6469",158,"Her own father’s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the","Emma"
"6470",158,"entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion,","Emma"
"6471",158,"was a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther from","Emma"
"6472",158,"approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.—Though always objecting to","Emma"
"6473",158,"every marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from the","Emma"
"6474",158,"apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any","Emma"
"6475",158,"two persons’ understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it","Emma"
"6476",158,"were proved against them. She blessed the favouring blindness. He could","Emma"
"6477",158,"now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a","Emma"
"6478",158,"glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way to all","Emma"
"6479",158,"his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr.","Emma"
"6480",158,"Frank Churchill’s accommodation on his journey, through the sad evils","Emma"
"6481",158,"of sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed","Emma"
"6482",158,"anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold—which,","Emma"
"6483",158,"however, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till","Emma"
"6484",158,"after another night.","Emma"
"6485",158,"","Emma"
"6486",158,"A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.—“He must be going.","Emma"
"6487",158,"He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands","Emma"
"6488",158,"for Mrs. Weston at Ford’s, but he need not hurry any body else.” His","Emma"
"6489",158,"son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying,","Emma"
"6490",158,"","Emma"
"6491",158,"“As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunity","Emma"
"6492",158,"of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore","Emma"
"6493",158,"may as well be paid now. I have the honour of being acquainted with a","Emma"
"6494",158,"neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady residing in or near","Emma"
"6495",158,"Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty,","Emma"
"6496",158,"I suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not the","Emma"
"6497",158,"proper name—I should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any","Emma"
"6498",158,"family of that name?”","Emma"
"6499",158,"","Emma"
"6500",158,"“To be sure we do,” cried his father; “Mrs. Bates—we passed her house—I","Emma"
"6501",158,"saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted with Miss","Emma"
"6502",158,"Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl she is.","Emma"
"6503",158,"Call upon her, by all means.”","Emma"
"6504",158,"","Emma"
"6505",158,"“There is no necessity for my calling this morning,” said the young","Emma"
"6506",158,"man; “another day would do as well; but there was that degree of","Emma"
"6507",158,"acquaintance at Weymouth which—”","Emma"
"6508",158,"","Emma"
"6509",158,"“Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done","Emma"
"6510",158,"cannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;","Emma"
"6511",158,"any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided. You","Emma"
"6512",158,"saw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body she","Emma"
"6513",158,"mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely","Emma"
"6514",158,"enough to live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight.”","Emma"
"6515",158,"","Emma"
"6516",158,"The son looked convinced.","Emma"
"6517",158,"","Emma"
"6518",158,"“I have heard her speak of the acquaintance,” said Emma; “she is a very","Emma"
"6519",158,"elegant young woman.”","Emma"
"6520",158,"","Emma"
"6521",158,"He agreed to it, but with so quiet a “Yes,” as inclined her almost to","Emma"
"6522",158,"doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort","Emma"
"6523",158,"of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thought","Emma"
"6524",158,"only ordinarily gifted with it.","Emma"
"6525",158,"","Emma"
"6526",158,"“If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,” said","Emma"
"6527",158,"she, “I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage; see her","Emma"
"6528",158,"and hear her—no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has","Emma"
"6529",158,"an aunt who never holds her tongue.”","Emma"
"6530",158,"","Emma"
"6531",158,"“You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?” said Mr.","Emma"
"6532",158,"Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; “then give","Emma"
"6533",158,"me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young","Emma"
"6534",158,"lady. She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, very","Emma"
"6535",158,"worthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremely","Emma"
"6536",158,"glad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to","Emma"
"6537",158,"shew you the way.”","Emma"
"6538",158,"","Emma"
"6539",158,"“My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.”","Emma"
"6540",158,"","Emma"
"6541",158,"“But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,","Emma"
"6542",158,"quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many","Emma"
"6543",158,"houses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,","Emma"
"6544",158,"unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you","Emma"
"6545",158,"had best cross the street.”","Emma"
"6546",158,"","Emma"
"6547",158,"Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,","Emma"
"6548",158,"and his father gave his hearty support by calling out, “My good friend,","Emma"
"6549",158,"this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees","Emma"
"6550",158,"it, and as to Mrs. Bates’s, he may get there from the Crown in a hop,","Emma"
"6551",158,"step, and jump.”","Emma"
"6552",158,"","Emma"
"6553",158,"They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a","Emma"
"6554",158,"graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emma","Emma"
"6555",158,"remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and","Emma"
"6556",158,"could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day,","Emma"
"6557",158,"with full confidence in their comfort.","Emma"

"6562",158,"CHAPTER VI","Emma"
"6563",158,"","Emma"
"6564",158,"","Emma"
"6565",158,"The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came with Mrs.","Emma"
"6566",158,"Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially. He","Emma"
"6567",158,"had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home,","Emma"
"6568",158,"till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their","Emma"
"6569",158,"walk, immediately fixed on Highbury.—“He did not doubt there being very","Emma"
"6570",158,"pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always","Emma"
"6571",158,"chuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury,","Emma"
"6572",158,"would be his constant attraction.”—Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood","Emma"
"6573",158,"for Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction","Emma"
"6574",158,"with him. They walked thither directly.","Emma"
"6575",158,"","Emma"
"6576",158,"Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for","Emma"
"6577",158,"half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew","Emma"
"6578",158,"nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her,","Emma"
"6579",158,"therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in","Emma"
"6580",158,"arm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in","Emma"
"6581",158,"company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him","Emma"
"6582",158,"was to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing should make amends","Emma"
"6583",158,"for it. But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied. It","Emma"
"6584",158,"was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid","Emma"
"6585",158,"his duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole","Emma"
"6586",158,"manner to her—nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of","Emma"
"6587",158,"considering her as a friend and securing her affection. And there was","Emma"
"6588",158,"time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit","Emma"
"6589",158,"included all the rest of the morning. They were all three walking about","Emma"
"6590",158,"together for an hour or two—first round the shrubberies of Hartfield,","Emma"
"6591",158,"and afterwards in Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired","Emma"
"6592",158,"Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse’s ear; and when their going","Emma"
"6593",158,"farther was resolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with","Emma"
"6594",158,"the whole village, and found matter of commendation and interest much","Emma"
"6595",158,"oftener than Emma could have supposed.","Emma"
"6596",158,"","Emma"
"6597",158,"Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He","Emma"
"6598",158,"begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and","Emma"
"6599",158,"which had been the home of his father’s father; and on recollecting","Emma"
"6600",158,"that an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest","Emma"
"6601",158,"of her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in","Emma"
"6602",158,"some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they","Emma"
"6603",158,"shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must","Emma"
"6604",158,"be very like a merit to those he was with.","Emma"
"6605",158,"","Emma"
"6606",158,"Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it","Emma"
"6607",158,"could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily","Emma"
"6608",158,"absenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a","Emma"
"6609",158,"parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had","Emma"
"6610",158,"not done him justice.","Emma"
"6611",158,"","Emma"
"6612",158,"Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though","Emma"
"6613",158,"the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses","Emma"
"6614",158,"were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any","Emma"
"6615",158,"run on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by","Emma"
"6616",158,"any interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of","Emma"
"6617",158,"the large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for a","Emma"
"6618",158,"ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly","Emma"
"6619",158,"populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;—but such","Emma"
"6620",158,"brilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for","Emma"
"6621",158,"which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established","Emma"
"6622",158,"among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was immediately","Emma"
"6623",158,"interested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of","Emma"
"6624",158,"passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed","Emma"
"6625",158,"windows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities,","Emma"
"6626",158,"and lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He saw no","Emma"
"6627",158,"fault in the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested. No,","Emma"
"6628",158,"it was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold the","Emma"
"6629",158,"very number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every","Emma"
"6630",158,"fortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the","Emma"
"6631",158,"former good old days of the room?—She who could do any thing in","Emma"
"6632",158,"Highbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction","Emma"
"6633",158,"that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted","Emma"
"6634",158,"to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not be","Emma"
"6635",158,"persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could","Emma"
"6636",158,"not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when","Emma"
"6637",158,"particulars were given and families described, he was still unwilling","Emma"
"6638",158,"to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing,","Emma"
"6639",158,"or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body’s","Emma"
"6640",158,"returning into their proper place the next morning. He argued like a","Emma"
"6641",158,"young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to","Emma"
"6642",158,"see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the","Emma"
"6643",158,"habits of the Churchills. He seemed to have all the life and spirit,","Emma"
"6644",158,"cheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his father, and nothing","Emma"
"6645",158,"of the pride or reserve of Enscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was,","Emma"
"6646",158,"perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank,","Emma"
"6647",158,"bordered too much on inelegance of mind. He could be no judge, however,","Emma"
"6648",158,"of the evil he was holding cheap. It was but an effusion of lively","Emma"
"6649",158,"spirits.","Emma"
"6650",158,"","Emma"
"6651",158,"At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown; and","Emma"
"6652",158,"being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma","Emma"
"6653",158,"recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he had","Emma"
"6654",158,"paid it.","Emma"
"6655",158,"","Emma"
"6656",158,"“Yes, oh! yes”—he replied; “I was just going to mention it. A very","Emma"
"6657",158,"successful visit:—I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much","Emma"
"6658",158,"obliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken","Emma"
"6659",158,"me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I","Emma"
"6660",158,"was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes","Emma"
"6661",158,"would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper;","Emma"
"6662",158,"and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him—but","Emma"
"6663",158,"there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I","Emma"
"6664",158,"found, when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that","Emma"
"6665",158,"I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an","Emma"
"6666",158,"hour. The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.”","Emma"
"6667",158,"","Emma"
"6668",158,"“And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?”","Emma"
"6669",158,"","Emma"
"6670",158,"“Ill, very ill—that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look","Emma"
"6671",158,"ill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it?","Emma"
"6672",158,"Ladies can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so","Emma"
"6673",158,"pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.—A most","Emma"
"6674",158,"deplorable want of complexion.”","Emma"
"6675",158,"","Emma"
"6676",158,"Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss","Emma"
"6677",158,"Fairfax’s complexion. “It was certainly never brilliant, but she would","Emma"
"6678",158,"not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness","Emma"
"6679",158,"and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character","Emma"
"6680",158,"of her face.” He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he","Emma"
"6681",158,"had heard many people say the same—but yet he must confess, that to him","Emma"
"6682",158,"nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health.","Emma"
"6683",158,"Where features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them","Emma"
"6684",158,"all; and where they were good, the effect was—fortunately he need not","Emma"
"6685",158,"attempt to describe what the effect was.","Emma"
"6686",158,"","Emma"
"6687",158,"“Well,” said Emma, “there is no disputing about taste.—At least you","Emma"
"6688",158,"admire her except her complexion.”","Emma"
"6689",158,"","Emma"
"6690",158,"He shook his head and laughed.—“I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her","Emma"
"6691",158,"complexion.”","Emma"
"6692",158,"","Emma"
"6693",158,"“Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same","Emma"
"6694",158,"society?”","Emma"
"6695",158,"","Emma"
"6696",158,"At this moment they were approaching Ford’s, and he hastily exclaimed,","Emma"
"6697",158,"“Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of","Emma"
"6698",158,"their lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highbury himself, he","Emma"
"6699",158,"says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford’s. If","Emma"
"6700",158,"it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove","Emma"
"6701",158,"myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I must","Emma"
"6702",158,"buy something at Ford’s. It will be taking out my freedom.—I dare say","Emma"
"6703",158,"they sell gloves.”","Emma"
"6704",158,"","Emma"
"6705",158,"“Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You will","Emma"
"6706",158,"be adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came, because","Emma"
"6707",158,"you were Mr. Weston’s son—but lay out half a guinea at Ford’s, and your","Emma"
"6708",158,"popularity will stand upon your own virtues.”","Emma"
"6709",158,"","Emma"
"6710",158,"They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of “Men’s Beavers”","Emma"
"6711",158,"and “York Tan” were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he","Emma"
"6712",158,"said—“But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me,","Emma"
"6713",158,"you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_","Emma"
"6714",158,"_patriae_. Do not let me lose it. I assure you the utmost stretch of","Emma"
"6715",158,"public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in","Emma"
"6716",158,"private life.”","Emma"
"6717",158,"","Emma"
"6718",158,"“I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her","Emma"
"6719",158,"party at Weymouth.”","Emma"
"6720",158,"","Emma"
"6721",158,"“And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a","Emma"
"6722",158,"very unfair one. It is always the lady’s right to decide on the degree","Emma"
"6723",158,"of acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.—I","Emma"
"6724",158,"shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.”","Emma"
"6725",158,"","Emma"
"6726",158,"“Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. But","Emma"
"6727",158,"her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very","Emma"
"6728",158,"reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any","Emma"
"6729",158,"body, that I really think you may say what you like of your","Emma"
"6730",158,"acquaintance with her.”","Emma"
"6731",158,"","Emma"
"6732",158,"“May I, indeed?—Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so","Emma"
"6733",158,"well. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a","Emma"
"6734",158,"little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.","Emma"
"6735",158,"Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,","Emma"
"6736",158,"warm-hearted woman. I like them all.”","Emma"
"6737",158,"","Emma"
"6738",158,"“You know Miss Fairfax’s situation in life, I conclude; what she is","Emma"
"6739",158,"destined to be?”","Emma"
"6740",158,"","Emma"
"6741",158,"“Yes—(rather hesitatingly)—I believe I do.”","Emma"
"6742",158,"","Emma"
"6743",158,"“You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,” said Mrs. Weston smiling;","Emma"
"6744",158,"“remember that I am here.—Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say","Emma"
"6745",158,"when you speak of Miss Fairfax’s situation in life. I will move a","Emma"
"6746",158,"little farther off.”","Emma"
"6747",158,"","Emma"
"6748",158,"“I certainly do forget to think of _her_,” said Emma, “as having ever","Emma"
"6749",158,"been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.”","Emma"

"6751",158,"He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.","Emma"

"6755",158,"Churchill.","Emma"
"6756",158,"","Emma"
"6757",158,"“Ever hear her!” repeated Emma. “You forget how much she belongs to","Emma"
"6758",158,"Highbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began.","Emma"
"6759",158,"She plays charmingly.”","Emma"
"6760",158,"","Emma"
"6761",158,"“You think so, do you?—I wanted the opinion of some one who could","Emma"
"6762",158,"really judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, with","Emma"
"6763",158,"considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.—I am","Emma"
"6764",158,"excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right of","Emma"
"6765",158,"judging of any body’s performance.—I have been used to hear her’s","Emma"
"6766",158,"admired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:—a","Emma"
"6767",158,"man, a very musical man, and in love with another woman—engaged to","Emma"
"6768",158,"her—on the point of marriage—would yet never ask that other woman to","Emma"
"6769",158,"sit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down","Emma"
"6770",158,"instead—never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other.","Emma"
"6771",158,"That, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof.”","Emma"
"6772",158,"","Emma"
"6773",158,"“Proof indeed!” said Emma, highly amused.—“Mr. Dixon is very musical,","Emma"
"6774",158,"is he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you,","Emma"
"6775",158,"than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.”","Emma"
"6776",158,"","Emma"
"6777",158,"“Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a","Emma"
"6778",158,"very strong proof.”","Emma"
"6779",158,"","Emma"
"6780",158,"“Certainly—very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger","Emma"
"6781",158,"than, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable","Emma"
"6782",158,"to me. I could not excuse a man’s having more music than love—more ear","Emma"
"6783",158,"than eye—a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings.","Emma"
"6784",158,"How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?”","Emma"
"6785",158,"","Emma"
"6786",158,"“It was her very particular friend, you know.”","Emma"
"6787",158,"","Emma"
"6788",158,"“Poor comfort!” said Emma, laughing. “One would rather have a stranger","Emma"
"6789",158,"preferred than one’s very particular friend—with a stranger it might","Emma"
"6790",158,"not recur again—but the misery of having a very particular friend","Emma"
"6791",158,"always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!—Poor","Emma"
"6792",158,"Mrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.”","Emma"
"6793",158,"","Emma"
"6794",158,"“You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she","Emma"
"6795",158,"really did not seem to feel it.”","Emma"
"6796",158,"","Emma"
"6797",158,"“So much the better—or so much the worse:—I do not know which. But be","Emma"
"6798",158,"it sweetness or be it stupidity in her—quickness of friendship, or","Emma"
"6799",158,"dulness of feeling—there was one person, I think, who must have felt","Emma"
"6800",158,"it: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerous","Emma"
"6801",158,"distinction.”","Emma"
"6802",158,"","Emma"
"6803",158,"“As to that—I do not—”","Emma"
"6804",158,"","Emma"
"6805",158,"“Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax’s","Emma"
"6806",158,"sensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no human","Emma"
"6807",158,"being, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever she","Emma"
"6808",158,"was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.”","Emma"
"6809",158,"","Emma"
"6810",158,"“There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all—” he","Emma"
"6811",158,"began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, “however, it is","Emma"
"6812",158,"impossible for me to say on what terms they really were—how it might","Emma"
"6813",158,"all be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness","Emma"
"6814",158,"outwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be a","Emma"
"6815",158,"better judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conduct","Emma"
"6816",158,"herself in critical situations, than I can be.”","Emma"
"6817",158,"","Emma"
"6818",158,"“I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children and","Emma"
"6819",158,"women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be","Emma"
"6820",158,"intimate,—that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited","Emma"
"6821",158,"her friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; a","Emma"
"6822",158,"little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to","Emma"
"6823",158,"take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always","Emma"
"6824",158,"was, by her aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, her","Emma"
"6825",158,"reserve—I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved.”","Emma"
"6826",158,"","Emma"
"6827",158,"“It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,” said he. “Oftentimes very","Emma"
"6828",158,"convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve,","Emma"
"6829",158,"but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.”","Emma"
"6830",158,"","Emma"
"6831",158,"“Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction","Emma"
"6832",158,"may be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an","Emma"
"6833",158,"agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of","Emma"
"6834",158,"conquering any body’s reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss","Emma"
"6835",158,"Fairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to think","Emma"
"6836",158,"ill of her—not the least—except that such extreme and perpetual","Emma"
"6837",158,"cautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea","Emma"
"6838",158,"about any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something","Emma"
"6839",158,"to conceal.”","Emma"
"6840",158,"","Emma"
"6841",158,"He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and","Emma"
"6842",158,"thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,","Emma"
"6843",158,"that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He","Emma"
"6844",158,"was not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in","Emma"
"6845",158,"some of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore","Emma"
"6846",158,"better than she had expected. His ideas seemed more moderate—his","Emma"
"6847",158,"feelings warmer. She was particularly struck by his manner of","Emma"
"6848",158,"considering Mr. Elton’s house, which, as well as the church, he would","Emma"
"6849",158,"go and look at, and would not join them in finding much fault with. No,","Emma"
"6850",158,"he could not believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to","Emma"
"6851",158,"be pitied for having. If it were to be shared with the woman he loved,","Emma"
"6852",158,"he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house. There","Emma"
"6853",158,"must be ample room in it for every real comfort. The man must be a","Emma"
"6854",158,"blockhead who wanted more.","Emma"
"6855",158,"","Emma"
"6856",158,"Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking","Emma"
"6857",158,"about. Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking","Emma"
"6858",158,"how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he","Emma"
"6859",158,"could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small","Emma"
"6860",158,"one. But Emma, in her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he","Emma"
"6861",158,"was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to","Emma"
"6862",158,"settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives. He might not","Emma"
"6863",158,"be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no","Emma"
"6864",158,"housekeeper’s room, or a bad butler’s pantry, but no doubt he did","Emma"
"6865",158,"perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy, and that","Emma"
"6866",158,"whenever he were attached, he would willingly give up much of wealth to","Emma"
"6867",158,"be allowed an early establishment.","Emma"

"6872",158,"CHAPTER VII","Emma"
"6873",158,"","Emma"
"6874",158,"","Emma"
"6875",158,"Emma’s very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the","Emma"
"6876",158,"following day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely to","Emma"
"6877",158,"have his hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at","Emma"
"6878",158,"breakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to","Emma"
"6879",158,"return to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than","Emma"
"6880",158,"having his hair cut. There was certainly no harm in his travelling","Emma"
"6881",158,"sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air of","Emma"
"6882",158,"foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve. It did not","Emma"
"6883",158,"accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or even","Emma"
"6884",158,"the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself to","Emma"
"6885",158,"discern in him yesterday. Vanity, extravagance, love of change,","Emma"
"6886",158,"restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad;","Emma"
"6887",158,"heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston,","Emma"
"6888",158,"indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became","Emma"
"6889",158,"liable to all these charges. His father only called him a coxcomb, and","Emma"
"6890",158,"thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, was","Emma"
"6891",158,"clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, and making","Emma"
"6892",158,"no other comment than that “all young people would have their little","Emma"
"6893",158,"whims.”","Emma"
"6894",158,"","Emma"
"6895",158,"With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit","Emma"
"6896",158,"hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston was","Emma"
"6897",158,"very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made","Emma"
"6898",158,"himself—how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. He","Emma"
"6899",158,"appeared to have a very open temper—certainly a very cheerful and","Emma"
"6900",158,"lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great","Emma"
"6901",158,"deal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond","Emma"
"6902",158,"of talking of him—said he would be the best man in the world if he were","Emma"
"6903",158,"left to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he","Emma"
"6904",158,"acknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to","Emma"
"6905",158,"speak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for","Emma"
"6906",158,"such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to","Emma"
"6907",158,"denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination","Emma"
"6908",158,"had given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of","Emma"
"6909",158,"being at least very near it, and saved only by her own","Emma"
"6910",158,"indifference—(for still her resolution held of never marrying)—the","Emma"
"6911",158,"honour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint","Emma"
"6912",158,"acquaintance.","Emma"
"6913",158,"","Emma"
"6914",158,"Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must have","Emma"
"6915",158,"some weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired her","Emma"
"6916",158,"extremely—thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so","Emma"
"6917",158,"much to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him","Emma"
"6918",158,"harshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, “all young people would have their","Emma"
"6919",158,"little whims.”","Emma"
"6920",158,"","Emma"
"6921",158,"There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so","Emma"
"6922",158,"leniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes","Emma"
"6923",158,"of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were","Emma"
"6924",158,"made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man—one who","Emma"
"6925",158,"smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them","Emma"
"6926",158,"not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles—Mr.","Emma"
"6927",158,"Knightley. The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment,","Emma"
"6928",158,"he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to","Emma"
"6929",158,"himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand, “Hum! just the trifling,","Emma"
"6930",158,"silly fellow I took him for.” She had half a mind to resent; but an","Emma"
"6931",158,"instant’s observation convinced her that it was really said only to","Emma"
"6932",158,"relieve his own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she","Emma"
"6933",158,"let it pass.","Emma"
"6934",158,"","Emma"
"6935",158,"Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and Mrs.","Emma"
"6936",158,"Weston’s visit this morning was in another respect particularly","Emma"
"6937",158,"opportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make","Emma"
"6938",158,"Emma want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted","Emma"
"6939",158,"exactly the advice they gave.","Emma"
"6940",158,"","Emma"
"6941",158,"This was the occurrence:—The Coles had been settled some years in","Emma"
"6942",158,"Highbury, and were very good sort of people—friendly, liberal, and","Emma"
"6943",158,"unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in","Emma"
"6944",158,"trade, and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the","Emma"
"6945",158,"country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping","Emma"
"6946",158,"little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two","Emma"
"6947",158,"had brought them a considerable increase of means—the house in town had","Emma"
"6948",158,"yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them.","Emma"
"6949",158,"With their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house,","Emma"
"6950",158,"their inclination for more company. They added to their house, to their","Emma"
"6951",158,"number of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time","Emma"
"6952",158,"were, in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at","Emma"
"6953",158,"Hartfield. Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared","Emma"
"6954",158,"every body for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly","Emma"
"6955",158,"among the single men, had already taken place. The regular and best","Emma"
"6956",158,"families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite—neither","Emma"
"6957",158,"Donwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt _her_ to go,","Emma"
"6958",158,"if they did; and she regretted that her father’s known habits would be","Emma"
"6959",158,"giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were","Emma"
"6960",158,"very respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was","Emma"
"6961",158,"not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would","Emma"
"6962",158,"visit them. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only","Emma"
"6963",158,"from herself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.","Emma"
"6964",158,"","Emma"
"6965",158,"But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks","Emma"
"6966",158,"before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her","Emma"
"6967",158,"very differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their","Emma"
"6968",158,"invitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs.","Emma"
"6969",158,"Weston’s accounting for it with “I suppose they will not take the","Emma"
"6970",158,"liberty with you; they know you do not dine out,” was not quite","Emma"
"6971",158,"sufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power of","Emma"
"6972",158,"refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled","Emma"
"6973",158,"there, consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her,","Emma"
"6974",158,"occurred again and again, she did not know that she might not have been","Emma"
"6975",158,"tempted to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the","Emma"
"6976",158,"Bateses. They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the","Emma"
"6977",158,"day before, and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her","Emma"
"6978",158,"absence. Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of","Emma"
"6979",158,"his. The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her","Emma"
"6980",158,"spirits; and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the","Emma"
"6981",158,"omission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.","Emma"
"6982",158,"","Emma"
"6983",158,"It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at","Emma"
"6984",158,"Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her","Emma"
"6985",158,"first remark, on reading it, was that “of course it must be declined,”","Emma"
"6986",158,"she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do,","Emma"
"6987",158,"that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.","Emma"
"6988",158,"","Emma"
"6989",158,"She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely without","Emma"
"6990",158,"inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so","Emma"
"6991",158,"properly—there was so much real attention in the manner of it—so much","Emma"
"6992",158,"consideration for her father. “They would have solicited the honour","Emma"
"6993",158,"earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from","Emma"
"6994",158,"London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of","Emma"
"6995",158,"air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour","Emma"
"6996",158,"of his company.” Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it being","Emma"
"6997",158,"briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without","Emma"
"6998",158,"neglecting his comfort—how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates,","Emma"
"6999",158,"might be depended on for bearing him company—Mr. Woodhouse was to be","Emma"
"7000",158,"talked into an acquiescence of his daughter’s going out to dinner on a","Emma"
"7001",158,"day now near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. As","Emma"
"7002",158,"for _his_ going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours","Emma"
"7003",158,"would be too late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well","Emma"
"7004",158,"resigned.","Emma"
"7005",158,"","Emma"
"7006",158,"“I am not fond of dinner-visiting,” said he—“I never was. No more is","Emma"
"7007",158,"Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole","Emma"
"7008",158,"should have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come","Emma"
"7009",158,"in one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us—take us in","Emma"
"7010",158,"their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so","Emma"
"7011",158,"reasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the","Emma"
"7012",158,"evening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any","Emma"
"7013",158,"body to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine","Emma"
"7014",158,"with them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to","Emma"
"7015",158,"take care of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be","Emma"
"7016",158,"what it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.” Then turning to Mrs.","Emma"
"7017",158,"Weston, with a look of gentle reproach—“Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not","Emma"
"7018",158,"married, you would have staid at home with me.”","Emma"
"7019",158,"","Emma"
"7020",158,"“Well, sir,” cried Mr. Weston, “as I took Miss Taylor away, it is","Emma"
"7021",158,"incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.","Emma"
"7022",158,"Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.”","Emma"
"7023",158,"","Emma"
"7024",158,"But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing, not","Emma"
"7025",158,"lessening, Mr. Woodhouse’s agitation. The ladies knew better how to","Emma"
"7026",158,"allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately","Emma"
"7027",158,"arranged.","Emma"
"7028",158,"","Emma"
"7029",158,"With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking","Emma"
"7030",158,"as usual. “He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great","Emma"
"7031",158,"regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her.","Emma"
"7032",158,"James could take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer","Emma"
"7033",158,"written to Mrs. Cole.”","Emma"
"7034",158,"","Emma"
"7035",158,"“You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will","Emma"
"7036",158,"say that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must","Emma"
"7037",158,"decline their obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_, of","Emma"
"7038",158,"course. But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is","Emma"
"7039",158,"to be done. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will","Emma"
"7040",158,"be wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him. We have","Emma"
"7041",158,"never been there above once since the new approach was made; but still","Emma"
"7042",158,"I have no doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get","Emma"
"7043",158,"there, you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you","Emma"
"7044",158,"again; and you had better name an early hour. You will not like staying","Emma"
"7045",158,"late. You will get very tired when tea is over.”","Emma"
"7046",158,"","Emma"
"7047",158,"“But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?”","Emma"
"7048",158,"","Emma"
"7049",158,"“Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great","Emma"
"7050",158,"many people talking at once. You will not like the noise.”","Emma"
"7051",158,"","Emma"
"7052",158,"“But, my dear sir,” cried Mr. Weston, “if Emma comes away early, it","Emma"
"7053",158,"will be breaking up the party.”","Emma"
"7054",158,"","Emma"
"7055",158,"“And no great harm if it does,” said Mr. Woodhouse. “The sooner every","Emma"
"7056",158,"party breaks up, the better.”","Emma"
"7057",158,"","Emma"
"7058",158,"“But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma’s going","Emma"
"7059",158,"away directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured","Emma"
"7060",158,"people, and think little of their own claims; but still they must feel","Emma"
"7061",158,"that any body’s hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss","Emma"
"7062",158,"Woodhouse’s doing it would be more thought of than any other person’s","Emma"
"7063",158,"in the room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I","Emma"
"7064",158,"am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have","Emma"
"7065",158,"been your neighbours these _ten_ years.”","Emma"
"7066",158,"","Emma"
"7067",158,"“No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to you","Emma"
"7068",158,"for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any","Emma"
"7069",158,"pain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole","Emma"
"7070",158,"never touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, but","Emma"
"7071",158,"he is bilious—Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means of","Emma"
"7072",158,"giving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure,","Emma"
"7073",158,"rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a","Emma"
"7074",158,"little longer than you might wish. You will not regard being tired. You","Emma"
"7075",158,"will be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends.”","Emma"
"7076",158,"","Emma"
"7077",158,"“Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no","Emma"
"7078",158,"scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am","Emma"
"7079",158,"only afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not","Emma"
"7080",158,"being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She loves piquet, you","Emma"
"7081",158,"know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by","Emma"
"7082",158,"yourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time—and the idea of","Emma"
"7083",158,"that would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to sit","Emma"
"7084",158,"up.”","Emma"
"7085",158,"","Emma"
"7086",158,"He did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that, if","Emma"
"7087",158,"she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if","Emma"
"7088",158,"hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid should","Emma"
"7089",158,"sit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that every","Emma"
"7090",158,"thing were safe in the house, as usual.","Emma"

"7095",158,"CHAPTER VIII","Emma"
"7096",158,"","Emma"
"7097",158,"","Emma"
"7098",158,"Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father’s dinner","Emma"
"7099",158,"waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious","Emma"
"7100",158,"for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any","Emma"
"7101",158,"imperfection which could be concealed.","Emma"
"7102",158,"","Emma"
"7103",158,"He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very","Emma"
"7104",158,"good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had","Emma"
"7105",158,"done. He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any","Emma"
"7106",158,"confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his","Emma"
"7107",158,"spirits. He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after","Emma"
"7108",158,"seeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:—","Emma"
"7109",158,"","Emma"
"7110",158,"“I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things do","Emma"
"7111",158,"cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent","Emma"
"7112",158,"way. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly.—It","Emma"
"7113",158,"depends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr. Knightley, he is","Emma"
"7114",158,"_not_ a trifling, silly young man. If he were, he would have done this","Emma"
"7115",158,"differently. He would either have gloried in the achievement, or been","Emma"
"7116",158,"ashamed of it. There would have been either the ostentation of a","Emma"
"7117",158,"coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own","Emma"
"7118",158,"vanities.—No, I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly.”","Emma"
"7119",158,"","Emma"
"7120",158,"With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, and for a","Emma"
"7121",158,"longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, and by","Emma"
"7122",158,"inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; of guessing","Emma"
"7123",158,"how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air;","Emma"
"7124",158,"and of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were","Emma"
"7125",158,"now seeing them together for the first time.","Emma"
"7126",158,"","Emma"
"7127",158,"She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr.","Emma"
"7128",158,"Cole’s; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr.","Emma"
"7129",158,"Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more than","Emma"
"7130",158,"his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.","Emma"
"7131",158,"","Emma"
"7132",158,"Her father’s comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs.","Emma"
"7133",158,"Goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she left","Emma"
"7134",158,"the house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after","Emma"
"7135",158,"dinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her","Emma"
"7136",158,"dress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, by helping","Emma"
"7137",158,"them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever","Emma"
"7138",158,"unwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obliged","Emma"
"7139",158,"them to practise during the meal.—She had provided a plentiful dinner","Emma"
"7140",158,"for them; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat","Emma"
"7141",158,"it.","Emma"
"7142",158,"","Emma"
"7143",158,"She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole’s door; and was pleased to","Emma"
"7144",158,"see that it was Mr. Knightley’s; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses,","Emma"
"7145",158,"having little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and","Emma"
"7146",158,"independence, was too apt, in Emma’s opinion, to get about as he could,","Emma"
"7147",158,"and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey.","Emma"
"7148",158,"She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from","Emma"
"7149",158,"her heart, for he stopped to hand her out.","Emma"
"7150",158,"","Emma"
"7151",158,"“This is coming as you should do,” said she; “like a gentleman.—I am","Emma"
"7152",158,"quite glad to see you.”","Emma"
"7153",158,"","Emma"
"7154",158,"He thanked her, observing, “How lucky that we should arrive at the same","Emma"
"7155",158,"moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether","Emma"
"7156",158,"you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.—You","Emma"
"7157",158,"might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.”","Emma"
"7158",158,"","Emma"
"7159",158,"“Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look of","Emma"
"7160",158,"consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be","Emma"
"7161",158,"beneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but","Emma"
"7162",158,"with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I","Emma"
"7163",158,"always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances. _Now_","Emma"
"7164",158,"you have nothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposed","Emma"
"7165",158,"ashamed. You are not striving to look taller than any body else. _Now_","Emma"
"7166",158,"I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you.”","Emma"
"7167",158,"","Emma"
"7168",158,"“Nonsensical girl!” was his reply, but not at all in anger.","Emma"
"7169",158,"","Emma"
"7170",158,"Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as","Emma"
"7171",158,"with Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial respect which could","Emma"
"7172",158,"not but please, and given all the consequence she could wish for. When","Emma"
"7173",158,"the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of","Emma"
"7174",158,"admiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approached","Emma"
"7175",158,"her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object,","Emma"
"7176",158,"and at dinner she found him seated by her—and, as she firmly believed,","Emma"
"7177",158,"not without some dexterity on his side.","Emma"
"7178",158,"","Emma"
"7179",158,"The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper","Emma"
"7180",158,"unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of","Emma"
"7181",158,"naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox’s family,","Emma"
"7182",158,"the lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come in the","Emma"
"7183",158,"evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already, at","Emma"
"7184",158,"dinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be","Emma"
"7185",158,"general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma could","Emma"
"7186",158,"fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her","Emma"
"7187",158,"neighbour. The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to","Emma"
"7188",158,"attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating","Emma"
"7189",158,"something of her that was expected to be very interesting. She","Emma"
"7190",158,"listened, and found it well worth listening to. That very dear part of","Emma"
"7191",158,"Emma, her fancy, received an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that","Emma"
"7192",158,"she had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room","Emma"
"7193",158,"had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte—a very elegant looking","Emma"
"7194",158,"instrument—not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the","Emma"
"7195",158,"substance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of","Emma"
"7196",158,"surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and","Emma"
"7197",158,"explanations on Miss Bates’s, was, that this pianoforte had arrived","Emma"
"7198",158,"from Broadwood’s the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt","Emma"
"7199",158,"and niece—entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates’s account,","Emma"
"7200",158,"Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could","Emma"
"7201",158,"possibly have ordered it—but now, they were both perfectly satisfied","Emma"
"7202",158,"that it could be from only one quarter;—of course it must be from","Emma"
"7203",158,"Colonel Campbell.","Emma"
"7204",158,"","Emma"
"7205",158,"“One can suppose nothing else,” added Mrs. Cole, “and I was only","Emma"
"7206",158,"surprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems,","Emma"
"7207",158,"had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it.","Emma"
"7208",158,"She knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence as","Emma"
"7209",158,"any reason for their not meaning to make the present. They might chuse","Emma"
"7210",158,"to surprize her.”","Emma"
"7211",158,"","Emma"
"7212",158,"Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the","Emma"
"7213",158,"subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,","Emma"
"7214",158,"and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were","Emma"
"7215",158,"enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and still","Emma"
"7216",158,"listen to Mrs. Cole.","Emma"
"7217",158,"","Emma"
"7218",158,"“I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me","Emma"
"7219",158,"more satisfaction!—It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who","Emma"
"7220",158,"plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemed quite a","Emma"
"7221",158,"shame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine","Emma"
"7222",158,"instruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like giving ourselves a","Emma"
"7223",158,"slap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I","Emma"
"7224",158,"really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the","Emma"
"7225",158,"drawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little","Emma"
"7226",158,"girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of","Emma"
"7227",158,"it; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not","Emma"
"7228",158,"any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old","Emma"
"7229",158,"spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.—I was saying this to Mr.","Emma"
"7230",158,"Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so","Emma"
"7231",158,"particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in","Emma"
"7232",158,"the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so","Emma"
"7233",158,"obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that","Emma"
"7234",158,"really is the reason why the instrument was bought—or else I am sure we","Emma"
"7235",158,"ought to be ashamed of it.—We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse","Emma"
"7236",158,"may be prevailed with to try it this evening.”","Emma"
"7237",158,"","Emma"
"7238",158,"Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing","Emma"
"7239",158,"more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole’s, turned","Emma"
"7240",158,"to Frank Churchill.","Emma"
"7241",158,"","Emma"
"7242",158,"“Why do you smile?” said she.","Emma"
"7243",158,"","Emma"
"7244",158,"“Nay, why do you?”","Emma"
"7245",158,"","Emma"
"7246",158,"“Me!—I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell’s being so rich","Emma"
"7247",158,"and so liberal.—It is a handsome present.”","Emma"
"7248",158,"","Emma"
"7249",158,"“Very.”","Emma"
"7250",158,"","Emma"
"7251",158,"“I rather wonder that it was never made before.”","Emma"
"7252",158,"","Emma"
"7253",158,"“Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.”","Emma"
"7254",158,"","Emma"
"7255",158,"“Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument—which must","Emma"
"7256",158,"now be shut up in London, untouched by any body.”","Emma"
"7257",158,"","Emma"
"7258",158,"“That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs.","Emma"
"7259",158,"Bates’s house.”","Emma"
"7260",158,"","Emma"
"7261",158,"“You may _say_ what you chuse—but your countenance testifies that your","Emma"
"7262",158,"_thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine.”","Emma"
"7263",158,"","Emma"
"7264",158,"“I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit for","Emma"
"7265",158,"acuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probably","Emma"
"7266",158,"suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what","Emma"
"7267",158,"there is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can","Emma"
"7268",158,"be?”","Emma"
"7269",158,"","Emma"
"7270",158,"“What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?”","Emma"
"7271",158,"","Emma"
"7272",158,"“Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. She","Emma"
"7273",158,"must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be;","Emma"
"7274",158,"and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a","Emma"
"7275",158,"young woman’s scheme than an elderly man’s. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare","Emma"
"7276",158,"say. I told you that your suspicions would guide mine.”","Emma"
"7277",158,"","Emma"
"7278",158,"“If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon in","Emma"
"7279",158,"them.”","Emma"
"7280",158,"","Emma"
"7281",158,"“Mr. Dixon.—Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the","Emma"
"7282",158,"joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day,","Emma"
"7283",158,"you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.”","Emma"
"7284",158,"","Emma"
"7285",158,"“Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had","Emma"
"7286",158,"entertained before.—I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions","Emma"
"7287",158,"of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting","Emma"
"7288",158,"either that, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the","Emma"
"7289",158,"misfortune to fall in love with _her_, or that he became conscious of a","Emma"
"7290",158,"little attachment on her side. One might guess twenty things without","Emma"
"7291",158,"guessing exactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular","Emma"
"7292",158,"cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the","Emma"
"7293",158,"Campbells to Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life of privation and","Emma"
"7294",158,"penance; there it would have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of","Emma"
"7295",158,"trying her native air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.—In the summer","Emma"
"7296",158,"it might have passed; but what can any body’s native air do for them in","Emma"
"7297",158,"the months of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages","Emma"
"7298",158,"would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and","Emma"
"7299",158,"I dare say in her’s. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions,","Emma"
"7300",158,"though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell","Emma"
"7301",158,"you what they are.”","Emma"
"7302",158,"","Emma"
"7303",158,"“And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon’s","Emma"
"7304",158,"preference of her music to her friend’s, I can answer for being very","Emma"
"7305",158,"decided.”","Emma"
"7306",158,"","Emma"
"7307",158,"“And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?—A water party;","Emma"
"7308",158,"and by some accident she was falling overboard. He caught her.”","Emma"
"7309",158,"","Emma"
"7310",158,"“He did. I was there—one of the party.”","Emma"
"7311",158,"","Emma"
"7312",158,"“Were you really?—Well!—But you observed nothing of course, for it","Emma"
"7313",158,"seems to be a new idea to you.—If I had been there, I think I should","Emma"
"7314",158,"have made some discoveries.”","Emma"
"7315",158,"","Emma"
"7316",158,"“I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that","Emma"
"7317",158,"Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon","Emma"
"7318",158,"caught her.—It was the work of a moment. And though the consequent","Emma"
"7319",158,"shock and alarm was very great and much more durable—indeed I believe","Emma"
"7320",158,"it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again—yet that","Emma"
"7321",158,"was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be","Emma"
"7322",158,"observable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made","Emma"
"7323",158,"discoveries.”","Emma"
"7324",158,"","Emma"
"7325",158,"The conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to share in","Emma"
"7326",158,"the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, and","Emma"
"7327",158,"obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when the","Emma"
"7328",158,"table was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed","Emma"
"7329",158,"exactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emma","Emma"
"7330",158,"said,","Emma"
"7331",158,"","Emma"
"7332",158,"“The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted to know a","Emma"
"7333",158,"little more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, we shall","Emma"
"7334",158,"soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.”","Emma"
"7335",158,"","Emma"
"7336",158,"“And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must","Emma"
"7337",158,"conclude it to come from the Campbells.”","Emma"
"7338",158,"","Emma"
"7339",158,"“No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it is","Emma"
"7340",158,"not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. She","Emma"
"7341",158,"would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. I may not have","Emma"
"7342",158,"convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr.","Emma"
"7343",158,"Dixon is a principal in the business.”","Emma"
"7344",158,"","Emma"
"7345",158,"“Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasonings","Emma"
"7346",158,"carry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposed","Emma"
"7347",158,"you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as","Emma"
"7348",158,"paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world.","Emma"
"7349",158,"But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that","Emma"
"7350",158,"it should be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see","Emma"
"7351",158,"it in no other light than as an offering of love.”","Emma"
"7352",158,"","Emma"
"7353",158,"There was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction","Emma"
"7354",158,"seemed real; he looked as if he felt it. She said no more, other","Emma"
"7355",158,"subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the","Emma"
"7356",158,"dessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired","Emma"
"7357",158,"amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few","Emma"
"7358",158,"downright silly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor","Emma"
"7359",158,"the other—nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old","Emma"
"7360",158,"news, and heavy jokes.","Emma"
"7361",158,"","Emma"
"7362",158,"The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other","Emma"
"7363",158,"ladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entree","Emma"
"7364",158,"of her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her","Emma"
"7365",158,"dignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and","Emma"
"7366",158,"the artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light,","Emma"
"7367",158,"cheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many","Emma"
"7368",158,"alleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed","Emma"
"7369",158,"affection. There she sat—and who would have guessed how many tears she","Emma"
"7370",158,"had been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself and","Emma"
"7371",158,"seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say","Emma"
"7372",158,"nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfax","Emma"
"7373",158,"did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been glad","Emma"
"7374",158,"to change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the","Emma"
"7375",158,"mortification of having loved—yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in","Emma"
"7376",158,"vain—by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself","Emma"
"7377",158,"beloved by the husband of her friend.","Emma"
"7378",158,"","Emma"
"7379",158,"In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.","Emma"
"7380",158,"She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the","Emma"
"7381",158,"secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair,","Emma"
"7382",158,"and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the","Emma"
"7383",158,"subject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush of","Emma"
"7384",158,"consciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush of","Emma"
"7385",158,"guilt which accompanied the name of “my excellent friend Colonel","Emma"
"7386",158,"Campbell.”","Emma"
"7387",158,"","Emma"
"7388",158,"Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested by","Emma"
"7389",158,"the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her","Emma"
"7390",158,"perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and","Emma"
"7391",158,"to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish","Emma"
"7392",158,"of saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly read in the","Emma"
"7393",158,"fair heroine’s countenance.","Emma"
"7394",158,"","Emma"
"7395",158,"They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of","Emma"
"7396",158,"the early was Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and the","Emma"
"7397",158,"handsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates","Emma"
"7398",158,"and her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the","Emma"
"7399",158,"circle, where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her,","Emma"
"7400",158,"would not sit at all. Emma divined what every body present must be","Emma"
"7401",158,"thinking. She was his object, and every body must perceive it. She","Emma"
"7402",158,"introduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments","Emma"
"7403",158,"afterwards, heard what each thought of the other. “He had never seen so","Emma"
"7404",158,"lovely a face, and was delighted with her naïveté.” And she, “Only to","Emma"
"7405",158,"be sure it was paying him too great a compliment, but she did think","Emma"
"7406",158,"there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton.” Emma restrained her","Emma"
"7407",158,"indignation, and only turned from her in silence.","Emma"
"7408",158,"","Emma"
"7409",158,"Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first","Emma"
"7410",158,"glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.","Emma"
"7411",158,"He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room—hated","Emma"
"7412",158,"sitting long—was always the first to move when he could—that his","Emma"
"7413",158,"father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over","Emma"
"7414",158,"parish business—that as long as he had staid, however, it had been","Emma"
"7415",158,"pleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set of","Emma"
"7416",158,"gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury","Emma"
"7417",158,"altogether—thought it so abundant in agreeable families—that Emma began","Emma"
"7418",158,"to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much. She","Emma"
"7419",158,"questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire—the extent of the","Emma"
"7420",158,"neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort; and could make out from his","Emma"
"7421",158,"answers that, as far as Enscombe was concerned, there was very little","Emma"
"7422",158,"going on, that their visitings were among a range of great families,","Emma"
"7423",158,"none very near; and that even when days were fixed, and invitations","Emma"
"7424",158,"accepted, it was an even chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health","Emma"
"7425",158,"and spirits for going; that they made a point of visiting no fresh","Emma"
"7426",158,"person; and that, though he had his separate engagements, it was not","Emma"
"7427",158,"without difficulty, without considerable address _at_ _times_, that he","Emma"
"7428",158,"could get away, or introduce an acquaintance for a night.","Emma"
"7429",158,"","Emma"
"7430",158,"She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at","Emma"
"7431",158,"its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement","Emma"
"7432",158,"at home than he liked. His importance at Enscombe was very evident. He","Emma"
"7433",158,"did not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he had persuaded","Emma"
"7434",158,"his aunt where his uncle could do nothing, and on her laughing and","Emma"
"7435",158,"noticing it, he owned that he believed (excepting one or two points) he","Emma"
"7436",158,"could _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing. One of those points on","Emma"
"7437",158,"which his influence failed, he then mentioned. He had wanted very much","Emma"
"7438",158,"to go abroad—had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel—but she","Emma"
"7439",158,"would not hear of it. This had happened the year before. _Now_, he","Emma"
"7440",158,"said, he was beginning to have no longer the same wish.","Emma"
"7441",158,"","Emma"
"7442",158,"The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed to be","Emma"
"7443",158,"good behaviour to his father.","Emma"
"7444",158,"","Emma"
"7445",158,"“I have made a most wretched discovery,” said he, after a short pause.—","Emma"
"7446",158,"“I have been here a week to-morrow—half my time. I never knew days fly","Emma"
"7447",158,"so fast. A week to-morrow!—And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself. But","Emma"
"7448",158,"just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!—I hate the","Emma"
"7449",158,"recollection.”","Emma"
"7450",158,"","Emma"
"7451",158,"“Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out","Emma"
"7452",158,"of so few, in having your hair cut.”","Emma"
"7453",158,"","Emma"
"7454",158,"“No,” said he, smiling, “that is no subject of regret at all. I have no","Emma"
"7455",158,"pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be","Emma"
"7456",158,"seen.”","Emma"
"7457",158,"","Emma"
"7458",158,"The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself","Emma"
"7459",158,"obliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole.","Emma"
"7460",158,"When Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored as","Emma"
"7461",158,"before, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at","Emma"
"7462",158,"Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.","Emma"
"7463",158,"","Emma"
"7464",158,"“What is the matter?” said she.","Emma"
"7465",158,"","Emma"
"7466",158,"He started. “Thank you for rousing me,” he replied. “I believe I have","Emma"
"7467",158,"been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a","Emma"
"7468",158,"way—so very odd a way—that I cannot keep my eyes from her. I never saw","Emma"
"7469",158,"any thing so outrée!—Those curls!—This must be a fancy of her own. I","Emma"
"7470",158,"see nobody else looking like her!—I must go and ask her whether it is","Emma"
"7471",158,"an Irish fashion. Shall I?—Yes, I will—I declare I will—and you shall","Emma"
"7472",158,"see how she takes it;—whether she colours.”","Emma"
"7473",158,"","Emma"
"7474",158,"He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss","Emma"
"7475",158,"Fairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady, as","Emma"
"7476",158,"he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in","Emma"
"7477",158,"front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.","Emma"
"7478",158,"","Emma"
"7479",158,"Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.","Emma"
"7480",158,"","Emma"
"7481",158,"“This is the luxury of a large party,” said she:—“one can get near","Emma"
"7482",158,"every body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk to","Emma"
"7483",158,"you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like","Emma"
"7484",158,"yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how","Emma"
"7485",158,"Miss Bates and her niece came here?”","Emma"
"7486",158,"","Emma"
"7487",158,"“How?—They were invited, were not they?”","Emma"
"7488",158,"","Emma"
"7489",158,"“Oh! yes—but how they were conveyed hither?—the manner of their","Emma"
"7490",158,"coming?”","Emma"
"7491",158,"","Emma"
"7492",158,"“They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?”","Emma"
"7493",158,"","Emma"
"7494",158,"“Very true.—Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it","Emma"
"7495",158,"would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and","Emma"
"7496",158,"cold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never saw","Emma"
"7497",158,"her appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and","Emma"
"7498",158,"would therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could","Emma"
"7499",158,"not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room,","Emma"
"7500",158,"and I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You may","Emma"
"7501",158,"guess how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I","Emma"
"7502",158,"made my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage","Emma"
"7503",158,"would be at her service before it took us home; for I thought it would","Emma"
"7504",158,"be making her comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as","Emma"
"7505",158,"possible, you may be sure. ‘Nobody was ever so fortunate as","Emma"
"7506",158,"herself!’—but with many, many thanks—‘there was no occasion to trouble","Emma"
"7507",158,"us, for Mr. Knightley’s carriage had brought, and was to take them home","Emma"
"7508",158,"again.’ I was quite surprized;—very glad, I am sure; but really quite","Emma"
"7509",158,"surprized. Such a very kind attention—and so thoughtful an","Emma"
"7510",158,"attention!—the sort of thing that so few men would think of. And, in","Emma"
"7511",158,"short, from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to think","Emma"
"7512",158,"that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do","Emma"
"7513",158,"suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself, and that it","Emma"
"7514",158,"was only as an excuse for assisting them.”","Emma"
"7515",158,"","Emma"
"7516",158,"“Very likely,” said Emma—“nothing more likely. I know no man more","Emma"
"7517",158,"likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing—to do any thing","Emma"
"7518",158,"really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a","Emma"
"7519",158,"gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane","Emma"
"7520",158,"Fairfax’s ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;—and for","Emma"
"7521",158,"an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on","Emma"
"7522",158,"more than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day—for we arrived","Emma"
"7523",158,"together; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that","Emma"
"7524",158,"could betray.”","Emma"
"7525",158,"","Emma"
"7526",158,"“Well,” said Mrs. Weston, smiling, “you give him credit for more","Emma"
"7527",158,"simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while","Emma"
"7528",158,"Miss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have","Emma"
"7529",158,"never been able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more","Emma"
"7530",158,"probable it appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr.","Emma"
"7531",158,"Knightley and Jane Fairfax. See the consequence of keeping you","Emma"
"7532",158,"company!—What do you say to it?”","Emma"
"7533",158,"","Emma"
"7534",158,"“Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!” exclaimed Emma. “Dear Mrs. Weston,","Emma"
"7535",158,"how could you think of such a thing?—Mr. Knightley!—Mr. Knightley must","Emma"
"7536",158,"not marry!—You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?—Oh!","Emma"
"7537",158,"no, no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consent to Mr.","Emma"
"7538",158,"Knightley’s marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. I am","Emma"
"7539",158,"amazed that you should think of such a thing.”","Emma"
"7540",158,"","Emma"
"7541",158,"“My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not","Emma"
"7542",158,"want the match—I do not want to injure dear little Henry—but the idea","Emma"
"7543",158,"has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished","Emma"
"7544",158,"to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry’s account, a boy of","Emma"
"7545",158,"six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?”","Emma"
"7546",158,"","Emma"
"7547",158,"“Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.—Mr. Knightley","Emma"
"7548",158,"marry!—No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt it now.","Emma"
"7549",158,"And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!”","Emma"
"7550",158,"","Emma"
"7551",158,"“Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well","Emma"
"7552",158,"know.”","Emma"
"7553",158,"","Emma"
"7554",158,"“But the imprudence of such a match!”","Emma"
"7555",158,"","Emma"
"7556",158,"“I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.”","Emma"
"7557",158,"","Emma"
"7558",158,"“I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than","Emma"
"7559",158,"what you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would","Emma"
"7560",158,"be quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great regard for","Emma"
"7561",158,"the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax—and is always glad","Emma"
"7562",158,"to shew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to","Emma"
"7563",158,"match-making. You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the","Emma"
"7564",158,"Abbey!—Oh! no, no;—every feeling revolts. For his own sake, I would not","Emma"
"7565",158,"have him do so mad a thing.”","Emma"
"7566",158,"","Emma"
"7567",158,"“Imprudent, if you please—but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune,","Emma"
"7568",158,"and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.”","Emma"
"7569",158,"","Emma"
"7570",158,"“But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not the","Emma"
"7571",158,"least idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?—He","Emma"
"7572",158,"is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and","Emma"
"7573",158,"his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond of","Emma"
"7574",158,"his brother’s children. He has no occasion to marry, either to fill up","Emma"
"7575",158,"his time or his heart.”","Emma"
"7576",158,"","Emma"
"7577",158,"“My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really","Emma"
"7578",158,"loves Jane Fairfax—”","Emma"
"7579",158,"","Emma"
"7580",158,"“Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I","Emma"
"7581",158,"am sure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but—”","Emma"
"7582",158,"","Emma"
"7583",158,"“Well,” said Mrs. Weston, laughing, “perhaps the greatest good he could","Emma"
"7584",158,"do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.”","Emma"
"7585",158,"","Emma"
"7586",158,"“If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; a","Emma"
"7587",158,"very shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have Miss","Emma"
"7588",158,"Bates belonging to him?—To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking","Emma"
"7589",158,"him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?—‘So very kind","Emma"
"7590",158,"and obliging!—But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!’ And","Emma"
"7591",158,"then fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother’s old petticoat.","Emma"
"7592",158,"‘Not that it was such a very old petticoat either—for still it would","Emma"
"7593",158,"last a great while—and, indeed, she must thankfully say that their","Emma"
"7594",158,"petticoats were all very strong.’”","Emma"
"7595",158,"","Emma"
"7596",158,"“For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against my","Emma"
"7597",158,"conscience. And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be","Emma"
"7598",158,"much disturbed by Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. She","Emma"
"7599",158,"might talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only","Emma"
"7600",158,"talk louder, and drown her voice. But the question is not, whether it","Emma"
"7601",158,"would be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think","Emma"
"7602",158,"he does. I have heard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of","Emma"
"7603",158,"Jane Fairfax! The interest he takes in her—his anxiety about her","Emma"
"7604",158,"health—his concern that she should have no happier prospect! I have","Emma"
"7605",158,"heard him express himself so warmly on those points!—Such an admirer of","Emma"
"7606",158,"her performance on the pianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him","Emma"
"7607",158,"say that he could listen to her for ever. Oh! and I had almost","Emma"
"7608",158,"forgotten one idea that occurred to me—this pianoforte that has been","Emma"
"7609",158,"sent here by somebody—though we have all been so well satisfied to","Emma"
"7610",158,"consider it a present from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr.","Emma"
"7611",158,"Knightley? I cannot help suspecting him. I think he is just the person","Emma"
"7612",158,"to do it, even without being in love.”","Emma"
"7613",158,"","Emma"
"7614",158,"“Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I do not","Emma"
"7615",158,"think it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley does","Emma"
"7616",158,"nothing mysteriously.”","Emma"
"7617",158,"","Emma"
"7618",158,"“I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly;","Emma"
"7619",158,"oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common","Emma"
"7620",158,"course of things, occur to him.”","Emma"
"7621",158,"","Emma"
"7622",158,"“Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told","Emma"
"7623",158,"her so.”","Emma"
"7624",158,"","Emma"
"7625",158,"“There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very","Emma"
"7626",158,"strong notion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularly","Emma"
"7627",158,"silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.”","Emma"
"7628",158,"","Emma"
"7629",158,"“You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have","Emma"
"7630",158,"many a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment—I","Emma"
"7631",158,"believe nothing of the pianoforte—and proof only shall convince me that","Emma"
"7632",158,"Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.”","Emma"
"7633",158,"","Emma"
"7634",158,"They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather","Emma"
"7635",158,"gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was the","Emma"
"7636",158,"most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed","Emma"
"7637",158,"them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;—and at the","Emma"
"7638",158,"same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do","Emma"
"7639",158,"them the honour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in the","Emma"
"7640",158,"eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeing","Emma"
"7641",158,"nothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr.","Emma"
"7642",158,"Cole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it","Emma"
"7643",158,"suited Emma best to lead, she gave a very proper compliance.","Emma"
"7644",158,"","Emma"
"7645",158,"She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more","Emma"
"7646",158,"than she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit","Emma"
"7647",158,"in the little things which are generally acceptable, and could","Emma"
"7648",158,"accompany her own voice well. One accompaniment to her song took her","Emma"
"7649",158,"agreeably by surprize—a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank","Emma"
"7650",158,"Churchill. Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and","Emma"
"7651",158,"every thing usual followed. He was accused of having a delightful","Emma"
"7652",158,"voice, and a perfect knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and","Emma"
"7653",158,"that he knew nothing of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly","Emma"
"7654",158,"asserted. They sang together once more; and Emma would then resign her","Emma"
"7655",158,"place to Miss Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental,","Emma"
"7656",158,"she never could attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely","Emma"
"7657",158,"superior to her own.","Emma"
"7658",158,"","Emma"
"7659",158,"With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the","Emma"
"7660",158,"numbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again.","Emma"
"7661",158,"They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the","Emma"
"7662",158,"sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half","Emma"
"7663",158,"Emma’s mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of","Emma"
"7664",158,"Mrs. Weston’s suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united","Emma"
"7665",158,"voices gave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr.","Emma"
"7666",158,"Knightley’s marrying did not in the least subside. She could see","Emma"
"7667",158,"nothing but evil in it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John","Emma"
"7668",158,"Knightley; consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children—a","Emma"
"7669",158,"most mortifying change, and material loss to them all;—a very great","Emma"
"7670",158,"deduction from her father’s daily comfort—and, as to herself, she could","Emma"
"7671",158,"not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs.","Emma"
"7672",158,"Knightley for them all to give way to!—No—Mr. Knightley must never","Emma"
"7673",158,"marry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.","Emma"
"7674",158,"","Emma"
"7675",158,"Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. They","Emma"
"7676",158,"talked at first only of the performance. His admiration was certainly","Emma"
"7677",158,"very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have","Emma"
"7678",158,"struck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his","Emma"
"7679",158,"kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in","Emma"
"7680",158,"the spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate","Emma"
"7681",158,"only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.","Emma"
"7682",158,"","Emma"
"7683",158,"“I often feel concern,” said she, “that I dare not make our carriage","Emma"
"7684",158,"more useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish;","Emma"
"7685",158,"but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should","Emma"
"7686",158,"put-to for such a purpose.”","Emma"
"7687",158,"","Emma"
"7688",158,"“Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,” he","Emma"
"7689",158,"replied;—“but you must often wish it, I am sure.” And he smiled with","Emma"
"7690",158,"such seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another","Emma"
"7691",158,"step.","Emma"
"7692",158,"","Emma"
"7693",158,"“This present from the Campbells,” said she—“this pianoforte is very","Emma"
"7694",158,"kindly given.”","Emma"
"7695",158,"","Emma"
"7696",158,"“Yes,” he replied, and without the smallest apparent","Emma"
"7697",158,"embarrassment.—“But they would have done better had they given her","Emma"
"7698",158,"notice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not","Emma"
"7699",158,"enhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should have","Emma"
"7700",158,"expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell.”","Emma"
"7701",158,"","Emma"
"7702",158,"From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had","Emma"
"7703",158,"had no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he were entirely","Emma"
"7704",158,"free from peculiar attachment—whether there were no actual","Emma"
"7705",158,"preference—remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane’s","Emma"
"7706",158,"second song, her voice grew thick.","Emma"
"7707",158,"","Emma"
"7708",158,"“That will do,” said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud—“you have","Emma"
"7709",158,"sung quite enough for one evening—now be quiet.”","Emma"
"7710",158,"","Emma"
"7711",158,"Another song, however, was soon begged for. “One more;—they would not","Emma"
"7712",158,"fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.”","Emma"
"7713",158,"And Frank Churchill was heard to say, “I think you could manage this","Emma"
"7714",158,"without effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of the","Emma"
"7715",158,"song falls on the second.”","Emma"
"7716",158,"","Emma"
"7717",158,"Mr. Knightley grew angry.","Emma"
"7718",158,"","Emma"
"7719",158,"“That fellow,” said he, indignantly, “thinks of nothing but shewing off","Emma"
"7720",158,"his own voice. This must not be.” And touching Miss Bates, who at that","Emma"
"7721",158,"moment passed near—“Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing","Emma"
"7722",158,"herself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on","Emma"
"7723",158,"her.”","Emma"
"7724",158,"","Emma"
"7725",158,"Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to be","Emma"
"7726",158,"grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther","Emma"
"7727",158,"singing. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss","Emma"
"7728",158,"Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but","Emma"
"7729",158,"soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing—originating nobody","Emma"
"7730",158,"exactly knew where—was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole,","Emma"
"7731",158,"that every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs.","Emma"
"7732",158,"Weston, capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an","Emma"
"7733",158,"irresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming","Emma"
"7734",158,"gallantry to Emma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.","Emma"
"7735",158,"","Emma"
"7736",158,"While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,","Emma"
"7737",158,"Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her","Emma"
"7738",158,"voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.","Emma"
"7739",158,"Knightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general. If he","Emma"
"7740",158,"were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur","Emma"
"7741",158,"something. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was talking to","Emma"
"7742",158,"Mrs. Cole—he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody","Emma"
"7743",158,"else, and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.","Emma"
"7744",158,"","Emma"
"7745",158,"Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and","Emma"
"7746",158,"she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more than","Emma"
"7747",158,"five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of it","Emma"
"7748",158,"made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a","Emma"
"7749",158,"partner. They were a couple worth looking at.","Emma"
"7750",158,"","Emma"
"7751",158,"Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It was","Emma"
"7752",158,"growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her","Emma"
"7753",158,"mother’s account. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to","Emma"
"7754",158,"begin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful,","Emma"
"7755",158,"and have done.","Emma"
"7756",158,"","Emma"
"7757",158,"“Perhaps it is as well,” said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma to","Emma"
"7758",158,"her carriage. “I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid dancing","Emma"
"7759",158,"would not have agreed with me, after yours.”","Emma"

"7763",158,"","Emma"
"7764",158,"CHAPTER IX","Emma"
"7765",158,"","Emma"
"7766",158,"","Emma"
"7767",158,"Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The visit","Emma"
"7768",158,"afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she","Emma"
"7769",158,"might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must","Emma"
"7770",158,"be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. She must have delighted","Emma"
"7771",158,"the Coles—worthy people, who deserved to be made happy!—And left a name","Emma"
"7772",158,"behind her that would not soon die away.","Emma"
"7773",158,"","Emma"
"7774",158,"Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two","Emma"
"7775",158,"points on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she had not","Emma"
"7776",158,"transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions of","Emma"
"7777",158,"Jane Fairfax’s feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but it","Emma"
"7778",158,"had been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his","Emma"
"7779",158,"submission to all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration,","Emma"
"7780",158,"which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to","Emma"
"7781",158,"have held her tongue.","Emma"
"7782",158,"","Emma"
"7783",158,"The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and","Emma"
"7784",158,"there she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret","Emma"
"7785",158,"the inferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartily","Emma"
"7786",158,"grieve over the idleness of her childhood—and sat down and practised","Emma"
"7787",158,"vigorously an hour and a half.","Emma"
"7788",158,"","Emma"
"7789",158,"She was then interrupted by Harriet’s coming in; and if Harriet’s","Emma"
"7790",158,"praise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.","Emma"
"7791",158,"","Emma"
"7792",158,"“Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!”","Emma"
"7793",158,"","Emma"
"7794",158,"“Don’t class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her’s,","Emma"
"7795",158,"than a lamp is like sunshine.”","Emma"
"7796",158,"","Emma"
"7797",158,"“Oh! dear—I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite","Emma"
"7798",158,"as well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body","Emma"
"7799",158,"last night said how well you played.”","Emma"
"7800",158,"","Emma"
"7801",158,"“Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The","Emma"
"7802",158,"truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,","Emma"
"7803",158,"but Jane Fairfax’s is much beyond it.”","Emma"
"7804",158,"","Emma"
"7805",158,"“Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or","Emma"
"7806",158,"that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole","Emma"
"7807",158,"said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great","Emma"
"7808",158,"deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more than","Emma"
"7809",158,"execution.”","Emma"
"7810",158,"","Emma"
"7811",158,"“Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.”","Emma"
"7812",158,"","Emma"
"7813",158,"“Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any","Emma"
"7814",158,"taste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.—There is no","Emma"
"7815",158,"understanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you","Emma"
"7816",158,"know, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to","Emma"
"7817",158,"teach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into","Emma"
"7818",158,"any great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?”","Emma"
"7819",158,"","Emma"
"7820",158,"“Just as they always do—very vulgar.”","Emma"
"7821",158,"","Emma"
"7822",158,"“They told me something,” said Harriet rather hesitatingly; “but it is","Emma"
"7823",158,"nothing of any consequence.”","Emma"
"7824",158,"","Emma"
"7825",158,"Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful of its","Emma"
"7826",158,"producing Mr. Elton.","Emma"
"7827",158,"","Emma"
"7828",158,"“They told me—that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.”","Emma"
"7829",158,"","Emma"
"7830",158,"“Oh!”","Emma"
"7831",158,"","Emma"
"7832",158,"“He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to stay","Emma"
"7833",158,"to dinner.”","Emma"
"7834",158,"","Emma"
"7835",158,"“Oh!”","Emma"
"7836",158,"","Emma"
"7837",158,"“They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do not know","Emma"
"7838",158,"what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay","Emma"
"7839",158,"there again next summer.”","Emma"
"7840",158,"","Emma"
"7841",158,"“She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should","Emma"
"7842",158,"be.”","Emma"
"7843",158,"","Emma"
"7844",158,"“She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat by her","Emma"
"7845",158,"at dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to","Emma"
"7846",158,"marry him.”","Emma"
"7847",158,"","Emma"
"7848",158,"“Very likely.—I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar","Emma"
"7849",158,"girls in Highbury.”","Emma"
"7850",158,"","Emma"
"7851",158,"Harriet had business at Ford’s.—Emma thought it most prudent to go with","Emma"
"7852",158,"her. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in","Emma"
"7853",158,"her present state, would be dangerous.","Emma"
"7854",158,"","Emma"
"7855",158,"Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always","Emma"
"7856",158,"very long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins","Emma"
"7857",158,"and changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.—Much could","Emma"
"7858",158,"not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;—Mr.","Emma"
"7859",158,"Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the","Emma"
"7860",158,"office-door, Mr. Cole’s carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a","Emma"
"7861",158,"stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she","Emma"
"7862",158,"could presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher","Emma"
"7863",158,"with his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her","Emma"
"7864",158,"full basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of","Emma"
"7865",158,"dawdling children round the baker’s little bow-window eyeing the","Emma"
"7866",158,"gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain, and was amused","Emma"
"7867",158,"enough; quite enough still to stand at the door. A mind lively and at","Emma"
"7868",158,"ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not","Emma"
"7869",158,"answer.","Emma"
"7870",158,"","Emma"
"7871",158,"She looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons","Emma"
"7872",158,"appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into","Emma"
"7873",158,"Highbury;—to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in the","Emma"
"7874",158,"first place at Mrs. Bates’s; whose house was a little nearer Randalls","Emma"
"7875",158,"than Ford’s; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their","Emma"
"7876",158,"eye.—Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the","Emma"
"7877",158,"agreeableness of yesterday’s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure","Emma"
"7878",158,"to the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to","Emma"
"7879",158,"call on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.","Emma"
"7880",158,"","Emma"
"7881",158,"“For my companion tells me,” said she, “that I absolutely promised Miss","Emma"
"7882",158,"Bates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of it","Emma"
"7883",158,"myself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I","Emma"
"7884",158,"am going now.”","Emma"
"7885",158,"","Emma"
"7886",158,"“And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,” said","Emma"
"7887",158,"Frank Churchill, “to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield—if","Emma"
"7888",158,"you are going home.”","Emma"
"7889",158,"","Emma"
"7890",158,"Mrs. Weston was disappointed.","Emma"
"7891",158,"","Emma"
"7892",158,"“I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased.”","Emma"
"7893",158,"","Emma"
"7894",158,"“Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps—I may be equally in the","Emma"
"7895",158,"way here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My aunt","Emma"
"7896",158,"always sends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to","Emma"
"7897",158,"death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same.","Emma"
"7898",158,"What am I to do?”","Emma"
"7899",158,"","Emma"
"7900",158,"“I am here on no business of my own,” said Emma; “I am only waiting for","Emma"
"7901",158,"my friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home.","Emma"
"7902",158,"But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument.”","Emma"
"7903",158,"","Emma"
"7904",158,"“Well—if you advise it.—But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell should","Emma"
"7905",158,"have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an","Emma"
"7906",158,"indifferent tone—what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs.","Emma"
"7907",158,"Weston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would","Emma"
"7908",158,"be palatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the","Emma"
"7909",158,"world at a civil falsehood.”","Emma"
"7910",158,"","Emma"
"7911",158,"“I do not believe any such thing,” replied Emma.—“I am persuaded that","Emma"
"7912",158,"you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but","Emma"
"7913",158,"there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quite","Emma"
"7914",158,"otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax’s opinion last night.”","Emma"
"7915",158,"","Emma"
"7916",158,"“Do come with me,” said Mrs. Weston, “if it be not very disagreeable to","Emma"
"7917",158,"you. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards. We","Emma"
"7918",158,"will follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It","Emma"
"7919",158,"will be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it.”","Emma"
"7920",158,"","Emma"
"7921",158,"He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,","Emma"
"7922",158,"returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates’s door. Emma watched them in,","Emma"
"7923",158,"and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,—trying, with all","Emma"
"7924",158,"the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain","Emma"
"7925",158,"muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be","Emma"
"7926",158,"it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. At","Emma"
"7927",158,"last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.","Emma"
"7928",158,"","Emma"
"7929",158,"“Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard’s, ma’am?” asked Mrs.","Emma"
"7930",158,"Ford.—“Yes—no—yes, to Mrs. Goddard’s. Only my pattern gown is at","Emma"
"7931",158,"Hartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then,","Emma"
"7932",158,"Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.—And I could take the pattern gown","Emma"
"7933",158,"home any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly—so it had better go","Emma"
"7934",158,"to Hartfield—at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels,","Emma"
"7935",158,"Mrs. Ford, could not you?”","Emma"
"7936",158,"","Emma"
"7937",158,"“It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two","Emma"
"7938",158,"parcels.”","Emma"
"7939",158,"","Emma"
"7940",158,"“No more it is.”","Emma"
"7941",158,"","Emma"
"7942",158,"“No trouble in the world, ma’am,” said the obliging Mrs. Ford.","Emma"
"7943",158,"","Emma"
"7944",158,"“Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if you","Emma"
"7945",158,"please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard’s—I do not know—No, I","Emma"
"7946",158,"think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield,","Emma"
"7947",158,"and take it home with me at night. What do you advise?”","Emma"
"7948",158,"","Emma"
"7949",158,"“That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield,","Emma"
"7950",158,"if you please, Mrs. Ford.”","Emma"
"7951",158,"","Emma"
"7952",158,"“Aye, that will be much best,” said Harriet, quite satisfied, “I should","Emma"
"7953",158,"not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard’s.”","Emma"
"7954",158,"","Emma"
"7955",158,"Voices approached the shop—or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs.","Emma"
"7956",158,"Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.","Emma"
"7957",158,"","Emma"
"7958",158,"“My dear Miss Woodhouse,” said the latter, “I am just run across to","Emma"
"7959",158,"entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,","Emma"
"7960",158,"and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How","Emma"
"7961",158,"do you do, Miss Smith?—Very well I thank you.—And I begged Mrs. Weston","Emma"
"7962",158,"to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.”","Emma"
"7963",158,"","Emma"
"7964",158,"“I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are—”","Emma"
"7965",158,"","Emma"
"7966",158,"“Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well;","Emma"
"7967",158,"and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so glad","Emma"
"7968",158,"to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.—Oh!","Emma"
"7969",158,"then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me","Emma"
"7970",158,"just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so","Emma"
"7971",158,"very happy to see her—and now we are such a nice party, she cannot","Emma"
"7972",158,"refuse.—‘Aye, pray do,’ said Mr. Frank Churchill, ‘Miss Woodhouse’s","Emma"
"7973",158,"opinion of the instrument will be worth having.’—But, said I, I shall","Emma"
"7974",158,"be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.—‘Oh,’ said","Emma"
"7975",158,"he, ‘wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;’—For, would you","Emma"
"7976",158,"believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in","Emma"
"7977",158,"the world, fastening in the rivet of my mother’s spectacles.—The rivet","Emma"
"7978",158,"came out, you know, this morning.—So very obliging!—For my mother had","Emma"
"7979",158,"no use of her spectacles—could not put them on. And, by the bye, every","Emma"
"7980",158,"body ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane","Emma"
"7981",158,"said so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I","Emma"
"7982",158,"did, but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one","Emma"
"7983",158,"thing, then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time","Emma"
"7984",158,"Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh,","Emma"
"7985",158,"said I, Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet","Emma"
"7986",158,"of your mistress’s spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home,","Emma"
"7987",158,"Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging","Emma"
"7988",158,"to us, the Wallises, always—I have heard some people say that Mrs.","Emma"
"7989",158,"Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never","Emma"
"7990",158,"known any thing but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be","Emma"
"7991",158,"for the value of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread,","Emma"
"7992",158,"you know? Only three of us.—besides dear Jane at present—and she really","Emma"
"7993",158,"eats nothing—makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite","Emma"
"7994",158,"frightened if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she","Emma"
"7995",158,"eats—so I say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But","Emma"
"7996",158,"about the middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she","Emma"
"7997",158,"likes so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome,","Emma"
"7998",158,"for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I","Emma"
"7999",158,"happened to meet him in the street. Not that I had any doubt before—I","Emma"
"8000",158,"have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it","Emma"
"8001",158,"is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly","Emma"
"8002",158,"wholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an","Emma"
"8003",158,"excellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I","Emma"
"8004",158,"hope, and these ladies will oblige us.”","Emma"
"8005",158,"","Emma"
"8006",158,"Emma would be “very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,” and they did at","Emma"
"8007",158,"last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,","Emma"
"8008",158,"","Emma"
"8009",158,"“How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before.","Emma"
"8010",158,"I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane","Emma"
"8011",158,"came back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well—only a","Emma"
"8012",158,"little too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.”","Emma"
"8013",158,"","Emma"
"8014",158,"“What was I talking of?” said she, beginning again when they were all","Emma"
"8015",158,"in the street.","Emma"
"8016",158,"","Emma"
"8017",158,"Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.","Emma"
"8018",158,"","Emma"
"8019",158,"“I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.—Oh! my mother’s","Emma"
"8020",158,"spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! ‘Oh!’ said he, ‘I","Emma"
"8021",158,"do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind","Emma"
"8022",158,"excessively.’—Which you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I must","Emma"
"8023",158,"say that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected,","Emma"
"8024",158,"he very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston,","Emma"
"8025",158,"most warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could.... ‘Oh!’","Emma"
"8026",158,"said he, ‘I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort","Emma"
"8027",158,"excessively.’ I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought out","Emma"
"8028",158,"the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so","Emma"
"8029",158,"very obliging as to take some, ‘Oh!’ said he directly, ‘there is","Emma"
"8030",158,"nothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the","Emma"
"8031",158,"finest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.’ That, you","Emma"
"8032",158,"know, was so very.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no","Emma"
"8033",158,"compliment. Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis","Emma"
"8034",158,"does them full justice—only we do not have them baked more than twice,","Emma"
"8035",158,"and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times—but","Emma"
"8036",158,"Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it. The apples","Emma"
"8037",158,"themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all","Emma"
"8038",158,"from Donwell—some of Mr. Knightley’s most liberal supply. He sends us a","Emma"
"8039",158,"sack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple","Emma"
"8040",158,"anywhere as one of his trees—I believe there is two of them. My mother","Emma"
"8041",158,"says the orchard was always famous in her younger days. But I was","Emma"
"8042",158,"really quite shocked the other day—for Mr. Knightley called one","Emma"
"8043",158,"morning, and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them and","Emma"
"8044",158,"said how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we were not got to","Emma"
"8045",158,"the end of our stock. ‘I am sure you must be,’ said he, ‘and I will","Emma"
"8046",158,"send you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever","Emma"
"8047",158,"use. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this","Emma"
"8048",158,"year. I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.’ So","Emma"
"8049",158,"I begged he would not—for really as to ours being gone, I could not","Emma"
"8050",158,"absolutely say that we had a great many left—it was but half a dozen","Emma"
"8051",158,"indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at all","Emma"
"8052",158,"bear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he had been","Emma"
"8053",158,"already; and Jane said the same. And when he was gone, she almost","Emma"
"8054",158,"quarrelled with me—No, I should not say quarrelled, for we never had a","Emma"
"8055",158,"quarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the","Emma"
"8056",158,"apples were so nearly gone; she wished I had made him believe we had a","Emma"
"8057",158,"great many left. Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could.","Emma"
"8058",158,"However, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large","Emma"
"8059",158,"basket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was","Emma"
"8060",158,"very much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said","Emma"
"8061",158,"every thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an old","Emma"
"8062",158,"acquaintance! I am always glad to see him. But, however, I found","Emma"
"8063",158,"afterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of","Emma"
"8064",158,"_that_ sort his master had; he had brought them all—and now his master","Emma"
"8065",158,"had not one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to mind it","Emma"
"8066",158,"himself, he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for","Emma"
"8067",158,"William, you know, thinks more of his master’s profit than any thing;","Emma"
"8068",158,"but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent","Emma"
"8069",158,"away. She could not bear that her master should not be able to have","Emma"
"8070",158,"another apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid her not","Emma"
"8071",158,"mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for Mrs.","Emma"
"8072",158,"Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were","Emma"
"8073",158,"sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told me,","Emma"
"8074",158,"and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley","Emma"
"8075",158,"know any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I wanted","Emma"
"8076",158,"to keep it from Jane’s knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it","Emma"
"8077",158,"before I was aware.”","Emma"
"8078",158,"","Emma"
"8079",158,"Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors","Emma"
"8080",158,"walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,","Emma"
"8081",158,"pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.","Emma"
"8082",158,"","Emma"
"8083",158,"“Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take","Emma"
"8084",158,"care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase—rather darker and","Emma"
"8085",158,"narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss","Emma"
"8086",158,"Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss","Emma"
"8087",158,"Smith, the step at the turning.”","Emma"

"8092",158,"CHAPTER X","Emma"
"8093",158,"","Emma"
"8094",158,"","Emma"
"8095",158,"The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was","Emma"
"8096",158,"tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,","Emma"
"8097",158,"slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near","Emma"
"8098",158,"her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,","Emma"
"8099",158,"standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.","Emma"
"8100",158,"","Emma"
"8101",158,"Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most","Emma"
"8102",158,"happy countenance on seeing Emma again.","Emma"
"8103",158,"","Emma"
"8104",158,"“This is a pleasure,” said he, in rather a low voice, “coming at least","Emma"
"8105",158,"ten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying to be","Emma"
"8106",158,"useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.”","Emma"
"8107",158,"","Emma"
"8108",158,"“What!” said Mrs. Weston, “have not you finished it yet? you would not","Emma"
"8109",158,"earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.”","Emma"
"8110",158,"","Emma"
"8111",158,"“I have not been working uninterruptedly,” he replied, “I have been","Emma"
"8112",158,"assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,","Emma"
"8113",158,"it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You see","Emma"
"8114",158,"we have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to","Emma"
"8115",158,"be persuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.”","Emma"
"8116",158,"","Emma"
"8117",158,"He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently","Emma"
"8118",158,"employed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to","Emma"
"8119",158,"make her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite","Emma"
"8120",158,"ready to sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not immediately","Emma"
"8121",158,"ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had","Emma"
"8122",158,"not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without","Emma"
"8123",158,"emotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance; and","Emma"
"8124",158,"Emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could","Emma"
"8125",158,"not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.","Emma"
"8126",158,"","Emma"
"8127",158,"At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the","Emma"
"8128",158,"powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs.","Emma"
"8129",158,"Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma joined","Emma"
"8130",158,"her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper","Emma"
"8131",158,"discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.","Emma"
"8132",158,"","Emma"
"8133",158,"“Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,” said Frank Churchill, with a","Emma"
"8134",158,"smile at Emma, “the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal of","Emma"
"8135",158,"Colonel Campbell’s taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper","Emma"
"8136",158,"notes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would","Emma"
"8137",158,"particularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave his","Emma"
"8138",158,"friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do not","Emma"
"8139",158,"you think so?”","Emma"
"8140",158,"","Emma"
"8141",158,"Jane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had","Emma"
"8142",158,"been speaking to her at the same moment.","Emma"
"8143",158,"","Emma"
"8144",158,"“It is not fair,” said Emma, in a whisper; “mine was a random guess. Do","Emma"
"8145",158,"not distress her.”","Emma"
"8146",158,"","Emma"
"8147",158,"He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little","Emma"
"8148",158,"doubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again,","Emma"
"8149",158,"","Emma"
"8150",158,"“How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on","Emma"
"8151",158,"this occasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, and","Emma"
"8152",158,"wonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument’s","Emma"
"8153",158,"coming to hand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to","Emma"
"8154",158,"be going forward just at this time?—Do you imagine it to be the","Emma"
"8155",158,"consequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may have","Emma"
"8156",158,"sent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to","Emma"
"8157",158,"depend upon contingencies and conveniences?”","Emma"
"8158",158,"","Emma"
"8159",158,"He paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,","Emma"
"8160",158,"","Emma"
"8161",158,"“Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,” said she, in a voice of","Emma"
"8162",158,"forced calmness, “I can imagine nothing with any confidence. It must be","Emma"
"8163",158,"all conjecture.”","Emma"
"8164",158,"","Emma"
"8165",158,"“Conjecture—aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one","Emma"
"8166",158,"conjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this","Emma"
"8167",158,"rivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard at","Emma"
"8168",158,"work, if one talks at all;—your real workmen, I suppose, hold their","Emma"
"8169",158,"tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word—Miss","Emma"
"8170",158,"Fairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I have","Emma"
"8171",158,"the pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles,","Emma"
"8172",158,"healed for the present.”","Emma"
"8173",158,"","Emma"
"8174",158,"He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a","Emma"
"8175",158,"little from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged Miss","Emma"
"8176",158,"Fairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.","Emma"
"8177",158,"","Emma"
"8178",158,"“If you are very kind,” said he, “it will be one of the waltzes we","Emma"
"8179",158,"danced last night;—let me live them over again. You did not enjoy them","Emma"
"8180",158,"as I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad we","Emma"
"8181",158,"danced no longer; but I would have given worlds—all the worlds one ever","Emma"
"8182",158,"has to give—for another half-hour.”","Emma"
"8183",158,"","Emma"
"8184",158,"She played.","Emma"
"8185",158,"","Emma"
"8186",158,"“What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one","Emma"
"8187",158,"happy!—If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.”","Emma"
"8188",158,"","Emma"
"8189",158,"She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played","Emma"
"8190",158,"something else. He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte,","Emma"
"8191",158,"and turning to Emma, said,","Emma"
"8192",158,"","Emma"
"8193",158,"“Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?—Cramer.—And here","Emma"
"8194",158,"are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might","Emma"
"8195",158,"expect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of","Emma"
"8196",158,"Colonel Campbell, was not it?—He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music","Emma"
"8197",158,"here. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to","Emma"
"8198",158,"have been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing","Emma"
"8199",158,"incomplete. True affection only could have prompted it.”","Emma"
"8200",158,"","Emma"
"8201",158,"Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;","Emma"
"8202",158,"and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the","Emma"
"8203",158,"remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of","Emma"
"8204",158,"consciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight, she had less","Emma"
"8205",158,"scruple in the amusement, and much less compunction with respect to","Emma"
"8206",158,"her.—This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently","Emma"
"8207",158,"cherishing very reprehensible feelings.","Emma"
"8208",158,"","Emma"
"8209",158,"He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.—Emma","Emma"
"8210",158,"took the opportunity of whispering,","Emma"
"8211",158,"","Emma"
"8212",158,"“You speak too plain. She must understand you.”","Emma"
"8213",158,"","Emma"
"8214",158,"“I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least","Emma"
"8215",158,"ashamed of my meaning.”","Emma"
"8216",158,"","Emma"
"8217",158,"“But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the","Emma"
"8218",158,"idea.”","Emma"
"8219",158,"","Emma"
"8220",158,"“I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have now","Emma"
"8221",158,"a key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If she does","Emma"
"8222",158,"wrong, she ought to feel it.”","Emma"
"8223",158,"","Emma"
"8224",158,"“She is not entirely without it, I think.”","Emma"
"8225",158,"","Emma"
"8226",158,"“I do not see much sign of it. She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at this","Emma"
"8227",158,"moment—_his_ favourite.”","Emma"
"8228",158,"","Emma"
"8229",158,"Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr.","Emma"
"8230",158,"Knightley on horse-back not far off.","Emma"
"8231",158,"","Emma"
"8232",158,"“Mr. Knightley I declare!—I must speak to him if possible, just to","Emma"
"8233",158,"thank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold;","Emma"
"8234",158,"but I can go into my mother’s room you know. I dare say he will come in","Emma"
"8235",158,"when he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meet","Emma"
"8236",158,"so!—Our little room so honoured!”","Emma"
"8237",158,"","Emma"
"8238",158,"She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening the","Emma"
"8239",158,"casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley’s attention, and every","Emma"
"8240",158,"syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others,","Emma"
"8241",158,"as if it had passed within the same apartment.","Emma"
"8242",158,"","Emma"
"8243",158,"“How d’ ye do?—how d’ye do?—Very well, I thank you. So obliged to you","Emma"
"8244",158,"for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready","Emma"
"8245",158,"for us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.”","Emma"
"8246",158,"","Emma"
"8247",158,"So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in","Emma"
"8248",158,"his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,","Emma"
"8249",158,"","Emma"
"8250",158,"“How is your niece, Miss Bates?—I want to inquire after you all, but","Emma"
"8251",158,"particularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?—I hope she caught no cold","Emma"
"8252",158,"last night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.”","Emma"
"8253",158,"","Emma"
"8254",158,"And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear","Emma"
"8255",158,"her in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave","Emma"
"8256",158,"Emma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her head in","Emma"
"8257",158,"steady scepticism.","Emma"
"8258",158,"","Emma"
"8259",158,"“So obliged to you!—so very much obliged to you for the carriage,”","Emma"
"8260",158,"resumed Miss Bates.","Emma"
"8261",158,"","Emma"
"8262",158,"He cut her short with,","Emma"
"8263",158,"","Emma"
"8264",158,"“I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?”","Emma"
"8265",158,"","Emma"
"8266",158,"“Oh! dear, Kingston—are you?—Mrs. Cole was saying the other day she","Emma"
"8267",158,"wanted something from Kingston.”","Emma"
"8268",158,"","Emma"
"8269",158,"“Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for _you_?”","Emma"
"8270",158,"","Emma"
"8271",158,"“No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?—Miss","Emma"
"8272",158,"Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new","Emma"
"8273",158,"pianoforte. Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.”","Emma"
"8274",158,"","Emma"
"8275",158,"“Well,” said he, in a deliberating manner, “for five minutes, perhaps.”","Emma"
"8276",158,"","Emma"
"8277",158,"“And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!—Quite delightful;","Emma"
"8278",158,"so many friends!”","Emma"
"8279",158,"","Emma"
"8280",158,"“No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on","Emma"
"8281",158,"to Kingston as fast as I can.”","Emma"
"8282",158,"","Emma"
"8283",158,"“Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.”","Emma"
"8284",158,"","Emma"
"8285",158,"“No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear","Emma"
"8286",158,"the pianoforte.”","Emma"
"8287",158,"","Emma"
"8288",158,"“Well, I am so sorry!—Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party last","Emma"
"8289",158,"night; how extremely pleasant.—Did you ever see such dancing?—Was not","Emma"
"8290",158,"it delightful?—Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never saw any","Emma"
"8291",158,"thing equal to it.”","Emma"
"8292",158,"","Emma"
"8293",158,"“Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss","Emma"
"8294",158,"Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes.","Emma"
"8295",158,"And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should","Emma"
"8296",158,"not be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs.","Emma"
"8297",158,"Weston is the very best country-dance player, without exception, in","Emma"
"8298",158,"England. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say","Emma"
"8299",158,"something pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay to","Emma"
"8300",158,"hear it.”","Emma"
"8301",158,"","Emma"
"8302",158,"“Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence—so","Emma"
"8303",158,"shocked!—Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!”","Emma"
"8304",158,"","Emma"
"8305",158,"“What is the matter now?”","Emma"
"8306",158,"","Emma"
"8307",158,"“To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you had a","Emma"
"8308",158,"great many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked!","Emma"
"8309",158,"Mrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You","Emma"
"8310",158,"should not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He never","Emma"
"8311",158,"can bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and it","Emma"
"8312",158,"would have been a pity not to have mentioned.... Well, (returning to","Emma"
"8313",158,"the room,) I have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop.","Emma"
"8314",158,"He is going to Kingston. He asked me if he could do any thing....”","Emma"
"8315",158,"","Emma"
"8316",158,"“Yes,” said Jane, “we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.”","Emma"
"8317",158,"","Emma"
"8318",158,"“Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was","Emma"
"8319",158,"open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. You must","Emma"
"8320",158,"have heard every thing to be sure. ‘Can I do any thing for you at","Emma"
"8321",158,"Kingston?’ said he; so I just mentioned.... Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must","Emma"
"8322",158,"you be going?—You seem but just come—so very obliging of you.”","Emma"
"8323",158,"","Emma"
"8324",158,"Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted","Emma"
"8325",158,"long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived to","Emma"
"8326",158,"be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, could","Emma"
"8327",158,"allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield","Emma"
"8328",158,"gates, before they set off for Randalls.","Emma"

"8332",158,"","Emma"
"8333",158,"CHAPTER XI","Emma"
"8334",158,"","Emma"
"8335",158,"","Emma"
"8336",158,"It may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have been","Emma"
"8337",158,"known of young people passing many, many months successively, without","Emma"
"8338",158,"being at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue","Emma"
"8339",158,"either to body or mind;—but when a beginning is made—when the","Emma"
"8340",158,"felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt—it","Emma"
"8341",158,"must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.","Emma"
"8342",158,"","Emma"
"8343",158,"Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;","Emma"
"8344",158,"and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded","Emma"
"8345",158,"to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young","Emma"
"8346",158,"people in schemes on the subject. Frank’s was the first idea; and his","Emma"
"8347",158,"the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of","Emma"
"8348",158,"the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and","Emma"
"8349",158,"appearance. But still she had inclination enough for shewing people","Emma"
"8350",158,"again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse","Emma"
"8351",158,"danced—for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself","Emma"
"8352",158,"with Jane Fairfax—and even for simple dancing itself, without any of","Emma"
"8353",158,"the wicked aids of vanity—to assist him first in pacing out the room","Emma"
"8354",158,"they were in to see what it could be made to hold—and then in taking","Emma"
"8355",158,"the dimensions of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in","Emma"
"8356",158,"spite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size,","Emma"
"8357",158,"that it was a little the largest.","Emma"
"8358",158,"","Emma"
"8359",158,"His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole’s","Emma"
"8360",158,"should be finished there—that the same party should be collected, and","Emma"
"8361",158,"the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. Mr.","Emma"
"8362",158,"Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston","Emma"
"8363",158,"most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance;","Emma"
"8364",158,"and the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly","Emma"
"8365",158,"who there would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of","Emma"
"8366",158,"space to every couple.","Emma"
"8367",158,"","Emma"
"8368",158,"“You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss","Emma"
"8369",158,"Coxes five,” had been repeated many times over. “And there will be the","Emma"
"8370",158,"two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley.","Emma"
"8371",158,"Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith, and","Emma"
"8372",158,"Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five","Emma"
"8373",158,"couple there will be plenty of room.”","Emma"
"8374",158,"","Emma"
"8375",158,"But soon it came to be on one side,","Emma"
"8376",158,"","Emma"
"8377",158,"“But will there be good room for five couple?—I really do not think","Emma"
"8378",158,"there will.”","Emma"
"8379",158,"","Emma"
"8380",158,"On another,","Emma"
"8381",158,"","Emma"
"8382",158,"“And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to","Emma"
"8383",158,"stand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.","Emma"
"8384",158,"It will not do to _invite_ five couple. It can be allowable only as the","Emma"
"8385",158,"thought of the moment.”","Emma"
"8386",158,"","Emma"
"8387",158,"Somebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother’s, and","Emma"
"8388",158,"must be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed _Mrs_. Gilbert","Emma"
"8389",158,"would have danced the other evening, if she had been asked. A word was","Emma"
"8390",158,"put in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one","Emma"
"8391",158,"family of cousins who must be included, and another of very old","Emma"
"8392",158,"acquaintance who could not be left out, it became a certainty that the","Emma"
"8393",158,"five couple would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation","Emma"
"8394",158,"in what possible manner they could be disposed of.","Emma"
"8395",158,"","Emma"
"8396",158,"The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. “Might not","Emma"
"8397",158,"they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?” It seemed the best","Emma"
"8398",158,"scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a","Emma"
"8399",158,"better. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress","Emma"
"8400",158,"about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score","Emma"
"8401",158,"of health. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be","Emma"
"8402",158,"persevered in.","Emma"
"8403",158,"","Emma"
"8404",158,"“Oh! no,” said he; “it would be the extreme of imprudence. I could not","Emma"
"8405",158,"bear it for Emma!—Emma is not strong. She would catch a dreadful cold.","Emma"
"8406",158,"So would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you would","Emma"
"8407",158,"be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Pray do","Emma"
"8408",158,"not let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is very","Emma"
"8409",158,"thoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite","Emma"
"8410",158,"the thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening, and","Emma"
"8411",158,"keeping them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of the","Emma"
"8412",158,"draught. I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not","Emma"
"8413",158,"quite the thing!”","Emma"
"8414",158,"","Emma"
"8415",158,"Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance of it,","Emma"
"8416",158,"and said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was now","Emma"
"8417",158,"closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only","Emma"
"8418",158,"in the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on","Emma"
"8419",158,"Frank Churchill’s part, that the space which a quarter of an hour","Emma"
"8420",158,"before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now","Emma"
"8421",158,"endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten.","Emma"
"8422",158,"","Emma"
"8423",158,"“We were too magnificent,” said he. “We allowed unnecessary room. Ten","Emma"
"8424",158,"couple may stand here very well.”","Emma"
"8425",158,"","Emma"
"8426",158,"Emma demurred. “It would be a crowd—a sad crowd; and what could be","Emma"
"8427",158,"worse than dancing without space to turn in?”","Emma"
"8428",158,"","Emma"
"8429",158,"“Very true,” he gravely replied; “it was very bad.” But still he went","Emma"
"8430",158,"on measuring, and still he ended with,","Emma"
"8431",158,"","Emma"
"8432",158,"“I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.”","Emma"
"8433",158,"","Emma"
"8434",158,"“No, no,” said she, “you are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadful","Emma"
"8435",158,"to be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to","Emma"
"8436",158,"be dancing in a crowd—and a crowd in a little room!”","Emma"
"8437",158,"","Emma"
"8438",158,"“There is no denying it,” he replied. “I agree with you exactly. A","Emma"
"8439",158,"crowd in a little room—Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving","Emma"
"8440",158,"pictures in a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!—Still, however,","Emma"
"8441",158,"having proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It","Emma"
"8442",158,"would be a disappointment to my father—and altogether—I do not know","Emma"
"8443",158,"that—I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very","Emma"
"8444",158,"well.”","Emma"
"8445",158,"","Emma"
"8446",158,"Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little","Emma"
"8447",158,"self-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of","Emma"
"8448",158,"dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest.","Emma"
"8449",158,"Had she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been worth while to","Emma"
"8450",158,"pause and consider, and try to understand the value of his preference,","Emma"
"8451",158,"and the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their","Emma"
"8452",158,"acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.","Emma"
"8453",158,"","Emma"
"8454",158,"Before the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered","Emma"
"8455",158,"the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of","Emma"
"8456",158,"the scheme. It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.","Emma"
"8457",158,"","Emma"
"8458",158,"“Well, Miss Woodhouse,” he almost immediately began, “your inclination","Emma"
"8459",158,"for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors","Emma"
"8460",158,"of my father’s little rooms. I bring a new proposal on the subject:—a","Emma"
"8461",158,"thought of my father’s, which waits only your approbation to be acted","Emma"
"8462",158,"upon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances","Emma"
"8463",158,"of this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the","Emma"
"8464",158,"Crown Inn?”","Emma"
"8465",158,"","Emma"
"8466",158,"“The Crown!”","Emma"
"8467",158,"","Emma"
"8468",158,"“Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you","Emma"
"8469",158,"cannot, my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him","Emma"
"8470",158,"there. Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less","Emma"
"8471",158,"grateful welcome than at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston sees","Emma"
"8472",158,"no objection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we all","Emma"
"8473",158,"feel. Oh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of the","Emma"
"8474",158,"Randalls rooms, would have been insufferable!—Dreadful!—I felt how","Emma"
"8475",158,"right you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing _any_","Emma"
"8476",158,"_thing_ to like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?—You consent—I hope","Emma"
"8477",158,"you consent?”","Emma"
"8478",158,"","Emma"
"8479",158,"“It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs.","Emma"
"8480",158,"Weston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for","Emma"
"8481",158,"myself, shall be most happy—It seems the only improvement that could","Emma"
"8482",158,"be. Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?”","Emma"
"8483",158,"","Emma"
"8484",158,"She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully","Emma"
"8485",158,"comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were","Emma"
"8486",158,"necessary to make it acceptable.","Emma"
"8487",158,"","Emma"
"8488",158,"“No; he thought it very far from an improvement—a very bad plan—much","Emma"
"8489",158,"worse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous;","Emma"
"8490",158,"never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance, they","Emma"
"8491",158,"had better dance at Randalls. He had never been in the room at the","Emma"
"8492",158,"Crown in his life—did not know the people who kept it by sight.—Oh!","Emma"
"8493",158,"no—a very bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than","Emma"
"8494",158,"anywhere.”","Emma"
"8495",158,"","Emma"
"8496",158,"“I was going to observe, sir,” said Frank Churchill, “that one of the","Emma"
"8497",158,"great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of","Emma"
"8498",158,"any body’s catching cold—so much less danger at the Crown than at","Emma"
"8499",158,"Randalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but","Emma"
"8500",158,"nobody else could.”","Emma"
"8501",158,"","Emma"
"8502",158,"“Sir,” said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, “you are very much mistaken","Emma"
"8503",158,"if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry is","Emma"
"8504",158,"extremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how","Emma"
"8505",158,"the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father’s house.”","Emma"
"8506",158,"","Emma"
"8507",158,"“From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have no","Emma"
"8508",158,"occasion to open the windows at all—not once the whole evening; and it","Emma"
"8509",158,"is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon","Emma"
"8510",158,"heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.”","Emma"
"8511",158,"","Emma"
"8512",158,"“Open the windows!—but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of","Emma"
"8513",158,"opening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I never","Emma"
"8514",158,"heard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!—I am sure, neither","Emma"
"8515",158,"your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer","Emma"
"8516",158,"it.”","Emma"
"8517",158,"","Emma"
"8518",158,"“Ah! sir—but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a","Emma"
"8519",158,"window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I","Emma"
"8520",158,"have often known it done myself.”","Emma"
"8521",158,"","Emma"
"8522",158,"“Have you indeed, sir?—Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But I","Emma"
"8523",158,"live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However,","Emma"
"8524",158,"this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it","Emma"
"8525",158,"over—but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One","Emma"
"8526",158,"cannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so","Emma"
"8527",158,"obliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what","Emma"
"8528",158,"can be done.”","Emma"
"8529",158,"","Emma"
"8530",158,"“But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited—”","Emma"
"8531",158,"","Emma"
"8532",158,"“Oh!” interrupted Emma, “there will be plenty of time for talking every","Emma"
"8533",158,"thing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to be at","Emma"
"8534",158,"the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will","Emma"
"8535",158,"be so near their own stable.”","Emma"
"8536",158,"","Emma"
"8537",158,"“So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James ever","Emma"
"8538",158,"complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I could","Emma"
"8539",158,"be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired—but is Mrs. Stokes to be","Emma"
"8540",158,"trusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight.”","Emma"
"8541",158,"","Emma"
"8542",158,"“I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be","Emma"
"8543",158,"under Mrs. Weston’s care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.”","Emma"
"8544",158,"","Emma"
"8545",158,"“There, papa!—Now you must be satisfied—Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who","Emma"
"8546",158,"is carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many","Emma"
"8547",158,"years ago, when I had the measles? ‘If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to","Emma"
"8548",158,"wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.’ How often have I","Emma"
"8549",158,"heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!”","Emma"
"8550",158,"","Emma"
"8551",158,"“Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor","Emma"
"8552",158,"little Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would","Emma"
"8553",158,"have been very bad, but for Perry’s great attention. He came four times","Emma"
"8554",158,"a day for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good","Emma"
"8555",158,"sort—which was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful","Emma"
"8556",158,"complaint. I hope whenever poor Isabella’s little ones have the","Emma"
"8557",158,"measles, she will send for Perry.”","Emma"
"8558",158,"","Emma"
"8559",158,"“My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,” said Frank","Emma"
"8560",158,"Churchill, “examining the capabilities of the house. I left them there","Emma"
"8561",158,"and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you","Emma"
"8562",158,"might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I was","Emma"
"8563",158,"desired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to them,","Emma"
"8564",158,"if you could allow me to attend you there. They can do nothing","Emma"
"8565",158,"satisfactorily without you.”","Emma"
"8566",158,"","Emma"
"8567",158,"Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,","Emma"
"8568",158,"engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people","Emma"
"8569",158,"set off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs.","Emma"
"8570",158,"Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy and","Emma"
"8571",158,"very happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; and","Emma"
"8572",158,"he, finding every thing perfect.","Emma"
"8573",158,"","Emma"
"8574",158,"“Emma,” said she, “this paper is worse than I expected. Look! in places","Emma"
"8575",158,"you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and","Emma"
"8576",158,"forlorn than any thing I could have imagined.”","Emma"
"8577",158,"","Emma"
"8578",158,"“My dear, you are too particular,” said her husband. “What does all","Emma"
"8579",158,"that signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be as","Emma"
"8580",158,"clean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our","Emma"
"8581",158,"club-nights.”","Emma"
"8582",158,"","Emma"
"8583",158,"The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, “Men never know","Emma"
"8584",158,"when things are dirty or not;” and the gentlemen perhaps thought each","Emma"
"8585",158,"to himself, “Women will have their little nonsenses and needless","Emma"
"8586",158,"cares.”","Emma"
"8587",158,"","Emma"
"8588",158,"One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain. It","Emma"
"8589",158,"regarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom’s being built,","Emma"
"8590",158,"suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was","Emma"
"8591",158,"the only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted","Emma"
"8592",158,"as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by","Emma"
"8593",158,"their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable","Emma"
"8594",158,"supper? Another room of much better size might be secured for the","Emma"
"8595",158,"purpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward","Emma"
"8596",158,"passage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs.","Emma"
"8597",158,"Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; and","Emma"
"8598",158,"neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being","Emma"
"8599",158,"miserably crowded at supper.","Emma"
"8600",158,"","Emma"
"8601",158,"Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches, &c.,","Emma"
"8602",158,"set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched","Emma"
"8603",158,"suggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was","Emma"
"8604",158,"pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and Mrs.","Emma"
"8605",158,"Weston must not speak of it again. She then took another line of","Emma"
"8606",158,"expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,","Emma"
"8607",158,"","Emma"
"8608",158,"“I do not think it _is_ so very small. We shall not be many, you know.”","Emma"
"8609",158,"","Emma"
"8610",158,"And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps","Emma"
"8611",158,"through the passage, was calling out,","Emma"
"8612",158,"","Emma"
"8613",158,"“You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a","Emma"
"8614",158,"mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.”","Emma"
"8615",158,"","Emma"
"8616",158,"“I wish,” said Mrs. Weston, “one could know which arrangement our","Emma"
"8617",158,"guests in general would like best. To do what would be most generally","Emma"
"8618",158,"pleasing must be our object—if one could but tell what that would be.”","Emma"
"8619",158,"","Emma"
"8620",158,"“Yes, very true,” cried Frank, “very true. You want your neighbours’","Emma"
"8621",158,"opinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chief","Emma"
"8622",158,"of them—the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I call","Emma"
"8623",158,"upon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.—And I do not know","Emma"
"8624",158,"whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of","Emma"
"8625",158,"the rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a larger","Emma"
"8626",158,"council. Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?”","Emma"
"8627",158,"","Emma"
"8628",158,"“Well—if you please,” said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, “if you think","Emma"
"8629",158,"she will be of any use.”","Emma"
"8630",158,"","Emma"
"8631",158,"“You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,” said Emma. “She","Emma"
"8632",158,"will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing. She","Emma"
"8633",158,"will not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in","Emma"
"8634",158,"consulting Miss Bates.”","Emma"
"8635",158,"","Emma"
"8636",158,"“But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearing","Emma"
"8637",158,"Miss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know.”","Emma"
"8638",158,"","Emma"
"8639",158,"Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it","Emma"
"8640",158,"his decided approbation.","Emma"
"8641",158,"","Emma"
"8642",158,"“Aye, do, Frank.—Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at","Emma"
"8643",158,"once. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a","Emma"
"8644",158,"properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss","Emma"
"8645",158,"Bates. We are growing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson of","Emma"
"8646",158,"how to be happy. But fetch them both. Invite them both.”","Emma"
"8647",158,"","Emma"
"8648",158,"“Both sir! Can the old lady?”...","Emma"
"8649",158,"","Emma"
"8650",158,"“The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a","Emma"
"8651",158,"great blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.”","Emma"
"8652",158,"","Emma"
"8653",158,"“Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect.","Emma"
"8654",158,"Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.”","Emma"
"8655",158,"And away he ran.","Emma"
"8656",158,"","Emma"
"8657",158,"Long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving","Emma"
"8658",158,"aunt, and her elegant niece,—Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman","Emma"
"8659",158,"and a good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of","Emma"
"8660",158,"it much less than she had supposed before—indeed very trifling; and","Emma"
"8661",158,"here ended the difficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculation","Emma"
"8662",158,"at least, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table and","Emma"
"8663",158,"chair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left","Emma"
"8664",158,"as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.","Emma"
"8665",158,"Stokes.—Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already","Emma"
"8666",158,"written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,","Emma"
"8667",158,"which could not possibly be refused. And a delightful dance it was to","Emma"
"8668",158,"be.","Emma"
"8669",158,"","Emma"
"8670",158,"Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must. As","Emma"
"8671",158,"a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safer","Emma"
"8672",158,"character,) she was truly welcome. Her approbation, at once general and","Emma"
"8673",158,"minute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another","Emma"
"8674",158,"half-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different","Emma"
"8675",158,"rooms, some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of","Emma"
"8676",158,"the future. The party did not break up without Emma’s being positively","Emma"
"8677",158,"secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor","Emma"
"8678",158,"without her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife, “He has asked","Emma"
"8679",158,"her, my dear. That’s right. I knew he would!”","Emma"

"8684",158,"CHAPTER XII","Emma"
"8685",158,"","Emma"
"8686",158,"","Emma"
"8687",158,"One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely","Emma"
"8688",158,"satisfactory to Emma—its being fixed for a day within the granted term","Emma"
"8689",158,"of Frank Churchill’s stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston’s","Emma"
"8690",158,"confidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the","Emma"
"8691",158,"Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his","Emma"
"8692",158,"fortnight. But this was not judged feasible. The preparations must take","Emma"
"8693",158,"their time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were","Emma"
"8694",158,"entered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and","Emma"
"8695",158,"hoping in uncertainty—at the risk—in her opinion, the great risk, of","Emma"
"8696",158,"its being all in vain.","Emma"
"8697",158,"","Emma"
"8698",158,"Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. His","Emma"
"8699",158,"wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not","Emma"
"8700",158,"opposed. All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one","Emma"
"8701",158,"solicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of","Emma"
"8702",158,"her ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley’s provoking","Emma"
"8703",158,"indifference about it. Either because he did not dance himself, or","Emma"
"8704",158,"because the plan had been formed without his being consulted, he seemed","Emma"
"8705",158,"resolved that it should not interest him, determined against its","Emma"
"8706",158,"exciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future amusement.","Emma"
"8707",158,"To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply,","Emma"
"8708",158,"than,","Emma"
"8709",158,"","Emma"
"8710",158,"“Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this","Emma"
"8711",158,"trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say","Emma"
"8712",158,"against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.—Oh! yes, I","Emma"
"8713",158,"must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I","Emma"
"8714",158,"can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins’s","Emma"
"8715",158,"week’s account; much rather, I confess.—Pleasure in seeing dancing!—not","Emma"
"8716",158,"I, indeed—I never look at it—I do not know who does.—Fine dancing, I","Emma"
"8717",158,"believe, like virtue, must be its own reward. Those who are standing by","Emma"
"8718",158,"are usually thinking of something very different.”","Emma"
"8719",158,"","Emma"
"8720",158,"This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It was","Emma"
"8721",158,"not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent,","Emma"
"8722",158,"or so indignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the","Emma"
"8723",158,"ball, for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree.","Emma"
"8724",158,"It made her animated—open hearted—she voluntarily said;—","Emma"
"8725",158,"","Emma"
"8726",158,"“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.","Emma"
"8727",158,"What a disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with","Emma"
"8728",158,"_very_ great pleasure.”","Emma"
"8729",158,"","Emma"
"8730",158,"It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have","Emma"
"8731",158,"preferred the society of William Larkins. No!—she was more and more","Emma"
"8732",158,"convinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. There","Emma"
"8733",158,"was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his","Emma"
"8734",158,"side—but no love.","Emma"
"8735",158,"","Emma"
"8736",158,"Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two","Emma"
"8737",158,"days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of","Emma"
"8738",158,"every thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew’s","Emma"
"8739",158,"instant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell—far too unwell to do without","Emma"
"8740",158,"him; she had been in a very suffering state (so said her husband) when","Emma"
"8741",158,"writing to her nephew two days before, though from her usual","Emma"
"8742",158,"unwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of","Emma"
"8743",158,"herself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill to trifle,","Emma"
"8744",158,"and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay.","Emma"
"8745",158,"","Emma"
"8746",158,"The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs.","Emma"
"8747",158,"Weston, instantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He must be gone","Emma"
"8748",158,"within a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt,","Emma"
"8749",158,"to lessen his repugnance. He knew her illnesses; they never occurred","Emma"
"8750",158,"but for her own convenience.","Emma"
"8751",158,"","Emma"
"8752",158,"Mrs. Weston added, “that he could only allow himself time to hurry to","Emma"
"8753",158,"Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there whom","Emma"
"8754",158,"he could suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might be","Emma"
"8755",158,"expected at Hartfield very soon.”","Emma"
"8756",158,"","Emma"
"8757",158,"This wretched note was the finale of Emma’s breakfast. When once it had","Emma"
"8758",158,"been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. The","Emma"
"8759",158,"loss of the ball—the loss of the young man—and all that the young man","Emma"
"8760",158,"might be feeling!—It was too wretched!—Such a delightful evening as it","Emma"
"8761",158,"would have been!—Every body so happy! and she and her partner the","Emma"
"8762",158,"happiest!—“I said it would be so,” was the only consolation.","Emma"
"8763",158,"","Emma"
"8764",158,"Her father’s feelings were quite distinct. He thought principally of","Emma"
"8765",158,"Mrs. Churchill’s illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and","Emma"
"8766",158,"as for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but","Emma"
"8767",158,"they would all be safer at home.","Emma"
"8768",158,"","Emma"
"8769",158,"Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if","Emma"
"8770",158,"this reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total","Emma"
"8771",158,"want of spirits when he did come might redeem him. He felt the going","Emma"
"8772",158,"away almost too much to speak of it. His dejection was most evident. He","Emma"
"8773",158,"sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing","Emma"
"8774",158,"himself, it was only to say,","Emma"
"8775",158,"","Emma"
"8776",158,"“Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.”","Emma"
"8777",158,"","Emma"
"8778",158,"“But you will come again,” said Emma. “This will not be your only visit","Emma"
"8779",158,"to Randalls.”","Emma"
"8780",158,"","Emma"
"8781",158,"“Ah!—(shaking his head)—the uncertainty of when I may be able to","Emma"
"8782",158,"return!—I shall try for it with a zeal!—It will be the object of all my","Emma"
"8783",158,"thoughts and cares!—and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring—but","Emma"
"8784",158,"I am afraid—they did not stir last spring—I am afraid it is a custom","Emma"
"8785",158,"gone for ever.”","Emma"
"8786",158,"","Emma"
"8787",158,"“Our poor ball must be quite given up.”","Emma"
"8788",158,"","Emma"
"8789",158,"“Ah! that ball!—why did we wait for any thing?—why not seize the","Emma"
"8790",158,"pleasure at once?—How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,","Emma"
"8791",158,"foolish preparation!—You told us it would be so.—Oh! Miss Woodhouse,","Emma"
"8792",158,"why are you always so right?”","Emma"
"8793",158,"","Emma"
"8794",158,"“Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much","Emma"
"8795",158,"rather have been merry than wise.”","Emma"
"8796",158,"","Emma"
"8797",158,"“If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends","Emma"
"8798",158,"on it. Do not forget your engagement.”","Emma"
"8799",158,"","Emma"
"8800",158,"Emma looked graciously.","Emma"
"8801",158,"","Emma"
"8802",158,"“Such a fortnight as it has been!” he continued; “every day more","Emma"
"8803",158,"precious and more delightful than the day before!—every day making me","Emma"
"8804",158,"less fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at","Emma"
"8805",158,"Highbury!”","Emma"
"8806",158,"","Emma"
"8807",158,"“As you do us such ample justice now,” said Emma, laughing, “I will","Emma"
"8808",158,"venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?","Emma"
"8809",158,"Do not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure","Emma"
"8810",158,"you did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long in","Emma"
"8811",158,"coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.”","Emma"
"8812",158,"","Emma"
"8813",158,"He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma","Emma"
"8814",158,"was convinced that it had been so.","Emma"
"8815",158,"","Emma"
"8816",158,"“And you must be off this very morning?”","Emma"
"8817",158,"","Emma"
"8818",158,"“Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I","Emma"
"8819",158,"must be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will","Emma"
"8820",158,"bring him.”","Emma"
"8821",158,"","Emma"
"8822",158,"“Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss","Emma"
"8823",158,"Bates? How unlucky! Miss Bates’s powerful, argumentative mind might","Emma"
"8824",158,"have strengthened yours.”","Emma"
"8825",158,"","Emma"
"8826",158,"“Yes—I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better. It","Emma"
"8827",158,"was a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was detained","Emma"
"8828",158,"by Miss Bates’s being absent. She was out; and I felt it impossible not","Emma"
"8829",158,"to wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may, that one _must_","Emma"
"8830",158,"laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay","Emma"
"8831",158,"my visit, then”—","Emma"
"8832",158,"","Emma"
"8833",158,"He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.","Emma"
"8834",158,"","Emma"
"8835",158,"“In short,” said he, “perhaps, Miss Woodhouse—I think you can hardly be","Emma"
"8836",158,"quite without suspicion”—","Emma"
"8837",158,"","Emma"
"8838",158,"He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardly knew","Emma"
"8839",158,"what to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely","Emma"
"8840",158,"serious, which she did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore,","Emma"
"8841",158,"in the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,","Emma"
"8842",158,"","Emma"
"8843",158,"“You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit,","Emma"
"8844",158,"then”—","Emma"
"8845",158,"","Emma"
"8846",158,"He was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting","Emma"
"8847",158,"on what she had said, and trying to understand the manner. She heard","Emma"
"8848",158,"him sigh. It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh.","Emma"
"8849",158,"He could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkward moments","Emma"
"8850",158,"passed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,","Emma"
"8851",158,"","Emma"
"8852",158,"“It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given","Emma"
"8853",158,"to Hartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm”—","Emma"
"8854",158,"","Emma"
"8855",158,"He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.—He was more","Emma"
"8856",158,"in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might","Emma"
"8857",158,"have ended, if his father had not made his appearance? Mr. Woodhouse","Emma"
"8858",158,"soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed.","Emma"
"8859",158,"","Emma"
"8860",158,"A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr.","Emma"
"8861",158,"Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of","Emma"
"8862",158,"procrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that","Emma"
"8863",158,"was doubtful, said, “It was time to go;” and the young man, though he","Emma"
"8864",158,"might and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.","Emma"
"8865",158,"","Emma"
"8866",158,"“I shall hear about you all,” said he; “that is my chief consolation. I","Emma"
"8867",158,"shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engaged","Emma"
"8868",158,"Mrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind as to promise","Emma"
"8869",158,"it. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really","Emma"
"8870",158,"interested in the absent!—she will tell me every thing. In her letters","Emma"
"8871",158,"I shall be at dear Highbury again.”","Emma"
"8872",158,"","Emma"
"8873",158,"A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest “Good-bye,” closed","Emma"
"8874",158,"the speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short had","Emma"
"8875",158,"been the notice—short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt so","Emma"
"8876",158,"sorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from","Emma"
"8877",158,"his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it","Emma"
"8878",158,"too much.","Emma"
"8879",158,"","Emma"
"8880",158,"It was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since his","Emma"
"8881",158,"arrival. Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the","Emma"
"8882",158,"last two weeks—indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation of","Emma"
"8883",158,"seeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of his","Emma"
"8884",158,"attentions, his liveliness, his manners! It had been a very happy","Emma"
"8885",158,"fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common","Emma"
"8886",158,"course of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, he","Emma"
"8887",158,"had _almost_ told her that he loved her. What strength, or what","Emma"
"8888",158,"constancy of affection he might be subject to, was another point; but","Emma"
"8889",158,"at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration,","Emma"
"8890",158,"a conscious preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all","Emma"
"8891",158,"the rest, made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him,","Emma"
"8892",158,"in spite of every previous determination against it.","Emma"
"8893",158,"","Emma"
"8894",158,"“I certainly must,” said she. “This sensation of listlessness,","Emma"
"8895",158,"weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ","Emma"
"8896",158,"myself, this feeling of every thing’s being dull and insipid about the","Emma"
"8897",158,"house!— I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world","Emma"
"8898",158,"if I were not—for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some is always","Emma"
"8899",158,"good to others. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not","Emma"
"8900",158,"for Frank Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy. He may spend the","Emma"
"8901",158,"evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes.”","Emma"
"8902",158,"","Emma"
"8903",158,"Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could not","Emma"
"8904",158,"say that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would","Emma"
"8905",158,"have contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that","Emma"
"8906",158,"he was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with","Emma"
"8907",158,"considerable kindness added,","Emma"
"8908",158,"","Emma"
"8909",158,"“You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really","Emma"
"8910",158,"out of luck; you are very much out of luck!”","Emma"
"8911",158,"","Emma"
"8912",158,"It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honest","Emma"
"8913",158,"regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure was","Emma"
"8914",158,"odious. She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from","Emma"
"8915",158,"headache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the ball","Emma"
"8916",158,"taken place, she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was","Emma"

"8923",158,"CHAPTER XIII","Emma"
"8924",158,"","Emma"
"8925",158,"","Emma"
"8926",158,"Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her ideas","Emma"
"8927",158,"only varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a good","Emma"
"8928",158,"deal; and afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in hearing","Emma"
"8929",158,"Frank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than","Emma"
"8930",158,"ever in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him,","Emma"
"8931",158,"and quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, how","Emma"
"8932",158,"were his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of his","Emma"
"8933",158,"coming to Randalls again this spring. But, on the other hand, she could","Emma"
"8934",158,"not admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be","Emma"
"8935",158,"less disposed for employment than usual; she was still busy and","Emma"
"8936",158,"cheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to have","Emma"
"8937",158,"faults; and farther, though thinking of him so much, and, as she sat","Emma"
"8938",158,"drawing or working, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress","Emma"
"8939",158,"and close of their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and","Emma"
"8940",158,"inventing elegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary","Emma"
"8941",158,"declaration on his side was that she _refused_ _him_. Their affection","Emma"
"8942",158,"was always to subside into friendship. Every thing tender and charming","Emma"
"8943",158,"was to mark their parting; but still they were to part. When she became","Emma"
"8944",158,"sensible of this, it struck her that she could not be very much in","Emma"
"8945",158,"love; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to","Emma"
"8946",158,"quit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must","Emma"
"8947",158,"produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings.","Emma"
"8948",158,"","Emma"
"8949",158,"“I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_,” said","Emma"
"8950",158,"she.—“In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives, is","Emma"
"8951",158,"there any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspect that he is not","Emma"
"8952",158,"really necessary to my happiness. So much the better. I certainly will","Emma"
"8953",158,"not persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quite enough in love.","Emma"
"8954",158,"I should be sorry to be more.”","Emma"
"8955",158,"","Emma"
"8956",158,"Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his","Emma"
"8957",158,"feelings.","Emma"
"8958",158,"","Emma"
"8959",158,"“_He_ is undoubtedly very much in love—every thing denotes it—very much","Emma"
"8960",158,"in love indeed!—and when he comes again, if his affection continue, I","Emma"
"8961",158,"must be on my guard not to encourage it.—It would be most inexcusable","Emma"
"8962",158,"to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. Not that I imagine he","Emma"
"8963",158,"can think I have been encouraging him hitherto. No, if he had believed","Emma"
"8964",158,"me at all to share his feelings, he would not have been so wretched.","Emma"
"8965",158,"Could he have thought himself encouraged, his looks and language at","Emma"
"8966",158,"parting would have been different.—Still, however, I must be on my","Emma"
"8967",158,"guard. This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it","Emma"
"8968",158,"now is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not look upon him","Emma"
"8969",158,"to be quite the sort of man—I do not altogether build upon his","Emma"
"8970",158,"steadiness or constancy.—His feelings are warm, but I can imagine them","Emma"
"8971",158,"rather changeable.—Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes","Emma"
"8972",158,"me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.—I shall do","Emma"
"8973",158,"very well again after a little while—and then, it will be a good thing","Emma"
"8974",158,"over; for they say every body is in love once in their lives, and I","Emma"
"8975",158,"shall have been let off easily.”","Emma"
"8976",158,"","Emma"
"8977",158,"When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and","Emma"
"8978",158,"she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at","Emma"
"8979",158,"first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had","Emma"
"8980",158,"undervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, giving","Emma"
"8981",158,"the particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the","Emma"
"8982",158,"affection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, and","Emma"
"8983",158,"describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed","Emma"
"8984",158,"attractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now of","Emma"
"8985",158,"apology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs.","Emma"
"8986",158,"Weston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast","Emma"
"8987",158,"between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was","Emma"
"8988",158,"just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much","Emma"
"8989",158,"more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.—The","Emma"
"8990",158,"charm of her own name was not wanting. _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more","Emma"
"8991",158,"than once, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either","Emma"
"8992",158,"a compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and","Emma"
"8993",158,"in the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by","Emma"
"8994",158,"any such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect of","Emma"
"8995",158,"her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all","Emma"
"8996",158,"conveyed. Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these","Emma"
"8997",158,"words—“I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss","Emma"
"8998",158,"Woodhouse’s beautiful little friend. Pray make my excuses and adieus to","Emma"
"8999",158,"her.” This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. Harriet was","Emma"
"9000",158,"remembered only from being _her_ friend. His information and prospects","Emma"
"9001",158,"as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated;","Emma"
"9002",158,"Mrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own","Emma"
"9003",158,"imagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.","Emma"
"9004",158,"","Emma"
"9005",158,"Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material","Emma"
"9006",158,"part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned","Emma"
"9007",158,"to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she","Emma"
"9008",158,"could still do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without","Emma"
"9009",158,"her. Her intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusal only grew","Emma"
"9010",158,"more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent","Emma"
"9011",158,"consolation and happiness. His recollection of Harriet, and the words","Emma"
"9012",158,"which clothed it, the “beautiful little friend,” suggested to her the","Emma"
"9013",158,"idea of Harriet’s succeeding her in his affections. Was it","Emma"
"9014",158,"impossible?—No.—Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in","Emma"
"9015",158,"understanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of","Emma"
"9016",158,"her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the","Emma"
"9017",158,"probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.—For","Emma"
"9018",158,"Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.","Emma"
"9019",158,"","Emma"
"9020",158,"“I must not dwell upon it,” said she.—“I must not think of it. I know","Emma"
"9021",158,"the danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger things have","Emma"
"9022",158,"happened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it","Emma"
"9023",158,"will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested","Emma"
"9024",158,"friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure.”","Emma"
"9025",158,"","Emma"
"9026",158,"It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet’s behalf, though it","Emma"
"9027",158,"might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that","Emma"
"9028",158,"quarter was at hand. As Frank Churchill’s arrival had succeeded Mr.","Emma"
"9029",158,"Elton’s engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest","Emma"
"9030",158,"interest had entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank","Emma"
"9031",158,"Churchill’s disappearance, Mr. Elton’s concerns were assuming the most","Emma"
"9032",158,"irresistible form.—His wedding-day was named. He would soon be among","Emma"
"9033",158,"them again; Mr. Elton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk over","Emma"
"9034",158,"the first letter from Enscombe before “Mr. Elton and his bride” was in","Emma"
"9035",158,"every body’s mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sick","Emma"
"9036",158,"at the sound. She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr.","Emma"
"9037",158,"Elton; and Harriet’s mind, she had been willing to hope, had been","Emma"
"9038",158,"lately gaining strength. With Mr. Weston’s ball in view at least, there","Emma"
"9039",158,"had been a great deal of insensibility to other things; but it was now","Emma"
"9040",158,"too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as","Emma"
"9041",158,"could stand against the actual approach—new carriage, bell-ringing, and","Emma"
"9042",158,"all.","Emma"
"9043",158,"","Emma"
"9044",158,"Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the","Emma"
"9045",158,"reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could","Emma"
"9046",158,"give. Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that Harriet","Emma"
"9047",158,"had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy","Emma"
"9048",158,"work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever","Emma"
"9049",158,"agreed to, without being able to make their opinions the same. Harriet","Emma"
"9050",158,"listened submissively, and said “it was very true—it was just as Miss","Emma"
"9051",158,"Woodhouse described—it was not worth while to think about them—and she","Emma"
"9052",158,"would not think about them any longer” but no change of subject could","Emma"
"9053",158,"avail, and the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the","Emma"
"9054",158,"Eltons as before. At last Emma attacked her on another ground.","Emma"
"9055",158,"","Emma"
"9056",158,"“Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr.","Emma"
"9057",158,"Elton’s marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make _me_.","Emma"
"9058",158,"You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into. It","Emma"
"9059",158,"was all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assure","Emma"
"9060",158,"you.—Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you—and it will be a","Emma"
"9061",158,"painful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger of","Emma"
"9062",158,"forgetting it.”","Emma"
"9063",158,"","Emma"
"9064",158,"Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager","Emma"
"9065",158,"exclamation. Emma continued,","Emma"
"9066",158,"","Emma"
"9067",158,"“I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk","Emma"
"9068",158,"less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I","Emma"
"9069",158,"would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than","Emma"
"9070",158,"my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is","Emma"
"9071",158,"your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the","Emma"
"9072",158,"suspicions of others, to save your health and credit, and restore your","Emma"
"9073",158,"tranquillity. These are the motives which I have been pressing on you.","Emma"
"9074",158,"They are very important—and sorry I am that you cannot feel them","Emma"
"9075",158,"sufficiently to act upon them. My being saved from pain is a very","Emma"
"9076",158,"secondary consideration. I want you to save yourself from greater pain.","Emma"
"9077",158,"Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what","Emma"
"9078",158,"was due—or rather what would be kind by me.”","Emma"
"9079",158,"","Emma"
"9080",158,"This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The idea of","Emma"
"9081",158,"wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really","Emma"
"9082",158,"loved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence","Emma"
"9083",158,"of grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt","Emma"
"9084",158,"to what was right and support her in it very tolerably.","Emma"
"9085",158,"","Emma"
"9086",158,"“You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life—Want","Emma"
"9087",158,"gratitude to you!—Nobody is equal to you!—I care for nobody as I do for","Emma"
"9088",158,"you!—Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!”","Emma"
"9089",158,"","Emma"
"9090",158,"Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and","Emma"
"9091",158,"manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so","Emma"

"9093",158,"","Emma"
"9094",158,"“There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,” said she afterwards","Emma"
"9095",158,"to herself. “There is nothing to be compared to it. Warmth and","Emma"
"9096",158,"tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all","Emma"
"9097",158,"the clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will.","Emma"
"9098",158,"It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally","Emma"
"9099",158,"beloved—which gives Isabella all her popularity.—I have it not—but I","Emma"
"9100",158,"know how to prize and respect it.—Harriet is my superior in all the","Emma"
"9101",158,"charm and all the felicity it gives. Dear Harriet!—I would not change","Emma"
"9102",158,"you for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female","Emma"
"9103",158,"breathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!—Harriet is worth a","Emma"
"9104",158,"hundred such—And for a wife—a sensible man’s wife—it is invaluable. I","Emma"
"9105",158,"mention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!”","Emma"

"9110",158,"CHAPTER XIV","Emma"
"9111",158,"","Emma"
"9112",158,"","Emma"
"9113",158,"Mrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be","Emma"
"9114",158,"interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and","Emma"
"9115",158,"it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to","Emma"
"9116",158,"settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or","Emma"
"9117",158,"not pretty at all.","Emma"
"9118",158,"","Emma"
"9119",158,"Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to","Emma"
"9120",158,"make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she","Emma"
"9121",158,"made a point of Harriet’s going with her, that the worst of the","Emma"
"9122",158,"business might be gone through as soon as possible.","Emma"
"9123",158,"","Emma"
"9124",158,"She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to","Emma"
"9125",158,"which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to","Emma"
"9126",158,"lace up her boot, without _recollecting_. A thousand vexatious thoughts","Emma"
"9127",158,"would recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was","Emma"
"9128",158,"not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too;","Emma"
"9129",158,"but she behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. The","Emma"
"9130",158,"visit was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and","Emma"
"9131",158,"occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself","Emma"
"9132",158,"entirely to form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one,","Emma"
"9133",158,"beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being “elegantly dressed, and very","Emma"
"9134",158,"pleasing.”","Emma"
"9135",158,"","Emma"
"9136",158,"She did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find fault,","Emma"
"9137",158,"but she suspected that there was no elegance;—ease, but not elegance.—","Emma"
"9138",158,"She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there","Emma"
"9139",158,"was too much ease. Her person was rather good; her face not unpretty;","Emma"
"9140",158,"but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant. Emma","Emma"
"9141",158,"thought at least it would turn out so.","Emma"
"9142",158,"","Emma"
"9143",158,"As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear—but no, she would not","Emma"
"9144",158,"permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. It was","Emma"
"9145",158,"an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a","Emma"
"9146",158,"man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The woman","Emma"
"9147",158,"was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the","Emma"
"9148",158,"privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to","Emma"
"9149",158,"depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr.","Emma"
"9150",158,"Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just","Emma"
"9151",158,"married, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had","Emma"
"9152",158,"been expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look as","Emma"
"9153",158,"little wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as","Emma"
"9154",158,"could be.","Emma"
"9155",158,"","Emma"
"9156",158,"“Well, Miss Woodhouse,” said Harriet, when they had quitted the house,","Emma"
"9157",158,"and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; “Well, Miss","Emma"
"9158",158,"Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?—Is not she","Emma"
"9159",158,"very charming?”","Emma"
"9160",158,"","Emma"
"9161",158,"There was a little hesitation in Emma’s answer.","Emma"
"9162",158,"","Emma"
"9163",158,"“Oh! yes—very—a very pleasing young woman.”","Emma"
"9164",158,"","Emma"
"9165",158,"“I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.”","Emma"
"9166",158,"","Emma"
"9167",158,"“Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.”","Emma"
"9168",158,"","Emma"
"9169",158,"“I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.”","Emma"
"9170",158,"","Emma"
"9171",158,"“Oh! no—there is nothing to surprize one at all.—A pretty fortune; and","Emma"
"9172",158,"she came in his way.”","Emma"
"9173",158,"","Emma"
"9174",158,"“I dare say,” returned Harriet, sighing again, “I dare say she was very","Emma"
"9175",158,"much attached to him.”","Emma"
"9176",158,"","Emma"
"9177",158,"“Perhaps she might; but it is not every man’s fate to marry the woman","Emma"
"9178",158,"who loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought","Emma"
"9179",158,"this the best offer she was likely to have.”","Emma"
"9180",158,"","Emma"
"9181",158,"“Yes,” said Harriet earnestly, “and well she might, nobody could ever","Emma"
"9182",158,"have a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now, Miss","Emma"
"9183",158,"Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He is just as","Emma"
"9184",158,"superior as ever;—but being married, you know, it is quite a different","Emma"
"9185",158,"thing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit","Emma"
"9186",158,"and admire him now without any great misery. To know that he has not","Emma"
"9187",158,"thrown himself away, is such a comfort!—She does seem a charming young","Emma"
"9188",158,"woman, just what he deserves. Happy creature! He called her ‘Augusta.’","Emma"
"9189",158,"How delightful!”","Emma"
"9190",158,"","Emma"
"9191",158,"When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could then see","Emma"
"9192",158,"more and judge better. From Harriet’s happening not to be at Hartfield,","Emma"
"9193",158,"and her father’s being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarter","Emma"
"9194",158,"of an hour of the lady’s conversation to herself, and could composedly","Emma"
"9195",158,"attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs.","Emma"
"9196",158,"Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and","Emma"
"9197",158,"thinking much of her own importance; that she meant to shine and be","Emma"
"9198",158,"very superior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school,","Emma"
"9199",158,"pert and familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one set of","Emma"
"9200",158,"people, and one style of living; that if not foolish she was ignorant,","Emma"
"9201",158,"and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.","Emma"
"9202",158,"","Emma"
"9203",158,"Harriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined herself,","Emma"
"9204",158,"she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it","Emma"
"9205",158,"might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best of","Emma"
"9206",158,"her own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the","Emma"
"9207",158,"alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride of him.","Emma"
"9208",158,"","Emma"
"9209",158,"The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, “My brother","Emma"
"9210",158,"Mr. Suckling’s seat;”—a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. The","Emma"
"9211",158,"grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was","Emma"
"9212",158,"modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed by","Emma"
"9213",158,"the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or","Emma"
"9214",158,"imagine. “Very like Maple Grove indeed!—She was quite struck by the","Emma"
"9215",158,"likeness!—That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at","Emma"
"9216",158,"Maple Grove; her sister’s favourite room.”—Mr. Elton was appealed","Emma"
"9217",158,"to.—“Was not it astonishingly like?—She could really almost fancy","Emma"
"9218",158,"herself at Maple Grove.”","Emma"
"9219",158,"","Emma"
"9220",158,"“And the staircase—You know, as I came in, I observed how very like the","Emma"
"9221",158,"staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I really","Emma"
"9222",158,"could not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very","Emma"
"9223",158,"delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial","Emma"
"9224",158,"to as Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there! (with a","Emma"
"9225",158,"little sigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body","Emma"
"9226",158,"who sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a","Emma"
"9227",158,"home. Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will","Emma"
"9228",158,"understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like","Emma"
"9229",158,"what one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of the evils","Emma"
"9230",158,"of matrimony.”","Emma"
"9231",158,"","Emma"
"9232",158,"Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient","Emma"
"9233",158,"for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.","Emma"
"9234",158,"","Emma"
"9235",158,"“So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house—the","Emma"
"9236",158,"grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like.","Emma"
"9237",158,"The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand","Emma"
"9238",158,"very much in the same way—just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse of","Emma"
"9239",158,"a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in","Emma"
"9240",158,"mind! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. People","Emma"
"9241",158,"who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing","Emma"
"9242",158,"in the same style.”","Emma"
"9243",158,"","Emma"
"9244",158,"Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea that","Emma"
"9245",158,"people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the","Emma"
"9246",158,"extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to","Emma"
"9247",158,"attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,","Emma"
"9248",158,"","Emma"
"9249",158,"“When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think","Emma"
"9250",158,"you have overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties.”","Emma"
"9251",158,"","Emma"
"9252",158,"“Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you","Emma"
"9253",158,"know. Surry is the garden of England.”","Emma"
"9254",158,"","Emma"
"9255",158,"“Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many","Emma"
"9256",158,"counties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as","Emma"
"9257",158,"Surry.”","Emma"
"9258",158,"","Emma"
"9259",158,"“No, I fancy not,” replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile. “I","Emma"
"9260",158,"never heard any county but Surry called so.”","Emma"
"9261",158,"","Emma"
"9262",158,"Emma was silenced.","Emma"
"9263",158,"","Emma"
"9264",158,"“My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or","Emma"
"9265",158,"summer at farthest,” continued Mrs. Elton; “and that will be our time","Emma"
"9266",158,"for exploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I","Emma"
"9267",158,"dare say. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds","Emma"
"9268",158,"four perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of _our_","Emma"
"9269",158,"carriage, we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely","Emma"
"9270",158,"well. They would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season","Emma"
"9271",158,"of the year. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly","Emma"
"9272",158,"recommend their bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much","Emma"
"9273",158,"preferable. When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you","Emma"
"9274",158,"know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as","Emma"
"9275",158,"possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored","Emma"
"9276",158,"to King’s-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully,","Emma"
"9277",158,"just after their first having the barouche-landau. You have many","Emma"
"9278",158,"parties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?”","Emma"
"9279",158,"","Emma"
"9280",158,"“No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the very","Emma"
"9281",158,"striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and","Emma"
"9282",158,"we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at","Emma"
"9283",158,"home than engage in schemes of pleasure.”","Emma"
"9284",158,"","Emma"
"9285",158,"“Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can","Emma"
"9286",158,"be more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at","Emma"
"9287",158,"Maple Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to","Emma"
"9288",158,"Bristol, ‘I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I","Emma"
"9289",158,"absolutely must go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the","Emma"
"9290",158,"barouche-landau without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her","Emma"
"9291",158,"own good-will, would never stir beyond the park paling.’ Many a time","Emma"
"9292",158,"has she said so; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. I","Emma"
"9293",158,"think, on the contrary, when people shut themselves up entirely from","Emma"
"9294",158,"society, it is a very bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to","Emma"
"9295",158,"mix in the world in a proper degree, without living in it either too","Emma"
"9296",158,"much or too little. I perfectly understand your situation, however,","Emma"
"9297",158,"Miss Woodhouse—(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father’s state of","Emma"
"9298",158,"health must be a great drawback. Why does not he try Bath?—Indeed he","Emma"
"9299",158,"should. Let me recommend Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of","Emma"
"9300",158,"its doing Mr. Woodhouse good.”","Emma"
"9301",158,"","Emma"
"9302",158,"“My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any","Emma"
"9303",158,"benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you,","Emma"
"9304",158,"does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.”","Emma"
"9305",158,"","Emma"
"9306",158,"“Ah! that’s a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the","Emma"
"9307",158,"waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath","Emma"
"9308",158,"life, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place,","Emma"
"9309",158,"that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse’s spirits,","Emma"
"9310",158,"which, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its","Emma"
"9311",158,"recommendations to _you_, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell","Emma"
"9312",158,"on them. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally","Emma"
"9313",158,"understood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived","Emma"
"9314",158,"so secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best","Emma"
"9315",158,"society in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host of","Emma"
"9316",158,"acquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have","Emma"
"9317",158,"always resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any","Emma"
"9318",158,"attentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public","Emma"
"9319",158,"with.”","Emma"
"9320",158,"","Emma"
"9321",158,"It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea of","Emma"
"9322",158,"her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an","Emma"
"9323",158,"_introduction_—of her going into public under the auspices of a friend","Emma"
"9324",158,"of Mrs. Elton’s—probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the help","Emma"
"9325",158,"of a boarder, just made a shift to live!—The dignity of Miss Woodhouse,","Emma"
"9326",158,"of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!","Emma"
"9327",158,"","Emma"
"9328",158,"She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could","Emma"
"9329",158,"have given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; “but their going to","Emma"
"9330",158,"Bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced","Emma"
"9331",158,"that the place might suit her better than her father.” And then, to","Emma"
"9332",158,"prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.","Emma"
"9333",158,"","Emma"
"9334",158,"“I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these","Emma"
"9335",158,"occasions, a lady’s character generally precedes her; and Highbury has","Emma"
"9336",158,"long known that you are a superior performer.”","Emma"
"9337",158,"","Emma"
"9338",158,"“Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior","Emma"
"9339",158,"performer!—very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial a","Emma"
"9340",158,"quarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of","Emma"
"9341",158,"music—passionately fond;—and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of","Emma"
"9342",158,"taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is","Emma"
"9343",158,"_mediocre_ to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play","Emma"
"9344",158,"delightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,","Emma"
"9345",158,"comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got","Emma"
"9346",158,"into. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life","Emma"
"9347",158,"to me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at","Emma"
"9348",158,"Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I","Emma"
"9349",158,"honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home,","Emma"
"9350",158,"and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be","Emma"
"9351",158,"disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too—knowing what I had","Emma"
"9352",158,"been accustomed to—of course he was not wholly without apprehension.","Emma"
"9353",158,"When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_","Emma"
"9354",158,"_world_ I could give up—parties, balls, plays—for I had no fear of","Emma"
"9355",158,"retirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was","Emma"
"9356",158,"not necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who","Emma"
"9357",158,"had no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me","Emma"
"9358",158,"quite independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used","Emma"
"9359",158,"to, I really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal","Emma"
"9360",158,"to any sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed","Emma"
"9361",158,"to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages","Emma"
"9362",158,"were not necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments.","Emma"
"9363",158,"‘But,’ said I, ‘to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without","Emma"
"9364",158,"something of a musical society. I condition for nothing else; but","Emma"
"9365",158,"without music, life would be a blank to me.’”","Emma"
"9366",158,"","Emma"
"9367",158,"“We cannot suppose,” said Emma, smiling, “that Mr. Elton would hesitate","Emma"
"9368",158,"to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury; and","Emma"
"9369",158,"I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be","Emma"
"9370",158,"pardoned, in consideration of the motive.”","Emma"
"9371",158,"","Emma"
"9372",158,"“No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to","Emma"
"9373",158,"find myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet little","Emma"
"9374",158,"concerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a","Emma"
"9375",158,"musical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.","Emma"
"9376",158,"Will not it be a good plan? If _we_ exert ourselves, I think we shall","Emma"
"9377",158,"not be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be","Emma"
"9378",158,"particularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me in","Emma"
"9379",158,"practice; for married women, you know—there is a sad story against","Emma"
"9380",158,"them, in general. They are but too apt to give up music.”","Emma"
"9381",158,"","Emma"
"9382",158,"“But you, who are so extremely fond of it—there can be no danger,","Emma"
"9383",158,"surely?”","Emma"
"9384",158,"","Emma"
"9385",158,"“I should hope not; but really when I look around among my","Emma"
"9386",158,"acquaintance, I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music—never","Emma"
"9387",158,"touches the instrument—though she played sweetly. And the same may be","Emma"
"9388",158,"said of Mrs. Jeffereys—Clara Partridge, that was—and of the two","Emma"
"9389",158,"Milmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can","Emma"
"9390",158,"enumerate. Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to","Emma"
"9391",158,"be quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a","Emma"
"9392",158,"married woman has many things to call her attention. I believe I was","Emma"
"9393",158,"half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper.”","Emma"
"9394",158,"","Emma"
"9395",158,"“But every thing of that kind,” said Emma, “will soon be in so regular","Emma"
"9396",158,"a train—”","Emma"
"9397",158,"","Emma"
"9398",158,"“Well,” said Mrs. Elton, laughing, “we shall see.”","Emma"
"9399",158,"","Emma"
"9400",158,"Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had nothing","Emma"
"9401",158,"more to say; and, after a moment’s pause, Mrs. Elton chose another","Emma"
"9402",158,"subject.","Emma"
"9403",158,"","Emma"
"9404",158,"“We have been calling at Randalls,” said she, “and found them both at","Emma"
"9405",158,"home; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them extremely.","Emma"
"9406",158,"Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature—quite a first-rate favourite","Emma"
"9407",158,"with me already, I assure you. And _she_ appears so truly good—there is","Emma"
"9408",158,"something so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one","Emma"
"9409",158,"directly. She was your governess, I think?”","Emma"
"9410",158,"","Emma"
"9411",158,"Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly","Emma"
"9412",158,"waited for the affirmative before she went on.","Emma"
"9413",158,"","Emma"
"9414",158,"“Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so very","Emma"
"9415",158,"lady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman.”","Emma"
"9416",158,"","Emma"
"9417",158,"“Mrs. Weston’s manners,” said Emma, “were always particularly good.","Emma"
"9418",158,"Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest","Emma"
"9419",158,"model for any young woman.”","Emma"
"9420",158,"","Emma"
"9421",158,"“And who do you think came in while we were there?”","Emma"
"9422",158,"","Emma"
"9423",158,"Emma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance—and","Emma"
"9424",158,"how could she possibly guess?","Emma"
"9425",158,"","Emma"
"9426",158,"“Knightley!” continued Mrs. Elton; “Knightley himself!—Was not it","Emma"
"9427",158,"lucky?—for, not being within when he called the other day, I had never","Emma"
"9428",158,"seen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.’s,","Emma"
"9429",158,"I had a great curiosity. ‘My friend Knightley’ had been so often","Emma"
"9430",158,"mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do my","Emma"
"9431",158,"caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his","Emma"
"9432",158,"friend. Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like him very much.","Emma"
"9433",158,"Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man.”","Emma"
"9434",158,"","Emma"
"9435",158,"Happily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could","Emma"
"9436",158,"breathe.","Emma"
"9437",158,"","Emma"
"9438",158,"“Insufferable woman!” was her immediate exclamation. “Worse than I had","Emma"
"9439",158,"supposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!—I could not have believed","Emma"
"9440",158,"it. Knightley!—never seen him in her life before, and call him","Emma"
"9441",158,"Knightley!—and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart,","Emma"
"9442",158,"vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_, and her","Emma"
"9443",158,"resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery.","Emma"
"9444",158,"Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether","Emma"
"9445",158,"he will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. I could","Emma"
"9446",158,"not have believed it! And to propose that she and I should unite to","Emma"
"9447",158,"form a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs.","Emma"
"9448",158,"Weston!—Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a","Emma"
"9449",158,"gentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much beyond","Emma"
"9450",158,"my hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would Frank","Emma"
"9451",158,"Churchill say to her, if he were here? How angry and how diverted he","Emma"
"9452",158,"would be! Ah! there I am—thinking of him directly. Always the first","Emma"
"9453",158,"person to be thought of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comes","Emma"
"9454",158,"as regularly into my mind!”—","Emma"
"9455",158,"","Emma"
"9456",158,"All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her","Emma"
"9457",158,"father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons’ departure,","Emma"
"9458",158,"and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.","Emma"
"9459",158,"","Emma"
"9460",158,"“Well, my dear,” he deliberately began, “considering we never saw her","Emma"
"9461",158,"before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she","Emma"
"9462",158,"was very much pleased with you. She speaks a little too quick. A little","Emma"
"9463",158,"quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe I","Emma"
"9464",158,"am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and","Emma"
"9465",158,"poor Miss Taylor. However, she seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved","Emma"
"9466",158,"young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife. Though I think","Emma"
"9467",158,"he had better not have married. I made the best excuses I could for not","Emma"
"9468",158,"having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion;","Emma"
"9469",158,"I said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer. But I ought","Emma"
"9470",158,"to have gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! it","Emma"
"9471",158,"shews what a sad invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into","Emma"
"9472",158,"Vicarage Lane.”","Emma"
"9473",158,"","Emma"
"9474",158,"“I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows you.”","Emma"
"9475",158,"","Emma"
"9476",158,"“Yes: but a young lady—a bride—I ought to have paid my respects to her","Emma"
"9477",158,"if possible. It was being very deficient.”","Emma"
"9478",158,"","Emma"
"9479",158,"“But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why","Emma"
"9480",158,"should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_? It ought to","Emma"
"9481",158,"be no recommendation to _you_. It is encouraging people to marry if you","Emma"
"9482",158,"make so much of them.”","Emma"
"9483",158,"","Emma"
"9484",158,"“No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always","Emma"
"9485",158,"wish to pay every proper attention to a lady—and a bride, especially,","Emma"
"9486",158,"is never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to _her_. A bride, you","Emma"
"9487",158,"know, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who","Emma"
"9488",158,"they may.”","Emma"
"9489",158,"","Emma"
"9490",158,"“Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what","Emma"
"9491",158,"is. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to","Emma"
"9492",158,"such vanity-baits for poor young ladies.”","Emma"
"9493",158,"","Emma"
"9494",158,"“My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere common","Emma"

"9496",158,"encouragement to people to marry.”","Emma"
"9497",158,"","Emma"
"9498",158,"Emma had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand","Emma"

"9506",158,"","Emma"
"9507",158,"","Emma"
"9508",158,"Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill","Emma"
"9509",158,"opinion of Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty correct. Such as","Emma"
"9510",158,"Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such she appeared","Emma"
"9511",158,"whenever they met again,—self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant,","Emma"
"9512",158,"and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment, but","Emma"
"9513",158,"so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior","Emma"
"9514",158,"knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood;","Emma"
"9515",158,"and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs.","Emma"
"9516",158,"Elton’s consequence only could surpass.","Emma"
"9517",158,"","Emma"
"9518",158,"There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently","Emma"
"9519",158,"from his wife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. He had","Emma"
"9520",158,"the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to","Emma"
"9521",158,"Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part","Emma"
"9522",158,"of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of","Emma"
"9523",158,"judging, following the lead of Miss Bates’s good-will, or taking it for","Emma"
"9524",158,"granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she","Emma"
"9525",158,"professed herself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton’s","Emma"
"9526",158,"praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by","Emma"
"9527",158,"Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talked","Emma"
"9528",158,"with a good grace of her being “very pleasant and very elegantly","Emma"
"9529",158,"dressed.”","Emma"
"9530",158,"","Emma"
"9531",158,"In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at","Emma"
"9532",158,"first. Her feelings altered towards Emma.—Offended, probably, by the","Emma"
"9533",158,"little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drew","Emma"
"9534",158,"back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and","Emma"
"9535",158,"though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was","Emma"
"9536",158,"necessarily increasing Emma’s dislike. Her manners, too—and Mr.","Emma"
"9537",158,"Elton’s, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering and","Emma"
"9538",158,"negligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet’s cure; but the","Emma"
"9539",158,"sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very","Emma"
"9540",158,"much.—It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet’s attachment had been","Emma"
"9541",158,"an offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own share in the story,","Emma"
"9542",158,"under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to","Emma"
"9543",158,"him, had in all likelihood been given also. She was, of course, the","Emma"
"9544",158,"object of their joint dislike.—When they had nothing else to say, it","Emma"
"9545",158,"must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity","Emma"
"9546",158,"which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her, found a broader","Emma"
"9547",158,"vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet.","Emma"
"9548",158,"","Emma"
"9549",158,"Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not","Emma"
"9550",158,"merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to","Emma"
"9551",158,"recommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied","Emma"
"9552",158,"with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration—but without","Emma"
"9553",158,"solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and","Emma"
"9554",158,"befriend her.—Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the","Emma"
"9555",158,"third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton’s knight-errantry","Emma"
"9556",158,"on the subject.—","Emma"
"9557",158,"","Emma"
"9558",158,"“Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.—I quite rave","Emma"
"9559",158,"about Jane Fairfax.—A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and","Emma"
"9560",158,"ladylike—and with such talents!—I assure you I think she has very","Emma"
"9561",158,"extraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely","Emma"
"9562",158,"well. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! she","Emma"
"9563",158,"is absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth—but, upon my word,","Emma"
"9564",158,"I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.—And her situation is so calculated","Emma"
"9565",158,"to affect one!—Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves and endeavour to","Emma"
"9566",158,"do something for her. We must bring her forward. Such talent as hers","Emma"
"9567",158,"must not be suffered to remain unknown.—I dare say you have heard those","Emma"
"9568",158,"charming lines of the poet,","Emma"
"9569",158,"","Emma"
"9570",158,"‘Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,","Emma"
"9571",158,"    ‘And waste its fragrance on the desert air.’","Emma"
"9572",158,"","Emma"
"9573",158,"","Emma"
"9574",158,"We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.”","Emma"
"9575",158,"","Emma"
"9576",158,"“I cannot think there is any danger of it,” was Emma’s calm answer—“and","Emma"
"9577",158,"when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax’s situation and","Emma"
"9578",158,"understand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I","Emma"
"9579",158,"have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.”","Emma"
"9580",158,"","Emma"
"9581",158,"“Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, such","Emma"
"9582",158,"obscurity, so thrown away.—Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed","Emma"
"9583",158,"with the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it.","Emma"
"9584",158,"I am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that she","Emma"
"9585",158,"feels the want of encouragement. I like her the better for it. I must","Emma"
"9586",158,"confess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate for","Emma"
"9587",158,"timidity—and I am sure one does not often meet with it.—But in those","Emma"
"9588",158,"who are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure","Emma"
"9589",158,"you, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more","Emma"
"9590",158,"than I can express.”","Emma"
"9591",158,"","Emma"
"9592",158,"“You appear to feel a great deal—but I am not aware how you or any of","Emma"
"9593",158,"Miss Fairfax’s acquaintance here, any of those who have known her","Emma"
"9594",158,"longer than yourself, can shew her any other attention than”—","Emma"
"9595",158,"","Emma"
"9596",158,"“My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to","Emma"
"9597",158,"act. You and I need not be afraid. If _we_ set the example, many will","Emma"
"9598",158,"follow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. _We_","Emma"
"9599",158,"have carriages to fetch and convey her home, and _we_ live in a style","Emma"
"9600",158,"which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the","Emma"
"9601",158,"least inconvenient.—I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to","Emma"
"9602",158,"send us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked _more_","Emma"
"9603",158,"than Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of","Emma"
"9604",158,"thing. It is not likely that I _should_, considering what I have been","Emma"
"9605",158,"used to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the","Emma"
"9606",158,"other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple","Emma"
"9607",158,"Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be—for we do not","Emma"
"9608",158,"at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.—However, my","Emma"
"9609",158,"resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.—I shall certainly have","Emma"
"9610",158,"her very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall","Emma"
"9611",158,"have musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly","Emma"
"9612",158,"on the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very","Emma"
"9613",158,"extensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her","Emma"
"9614",158,"shortly.—I shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to my","Emma"
"9615",158,"brother and sister when they come to us. I am sure they will like her","Emma"
"9616",158,"extremely; and when she gets a little acquainted with them, her fears","Emma"
"9617",158,"will completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners of","Emma"
"9618",158,"either but what is highly conciliating.—I shall have her very often","Emma"
"9619",158,"indeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a","Emma"
"9620",158,"seat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.”","Emma"
"9621",158,"","Emma"
"9622",158,"“Poor Jane Fairfax!”—thought Emma.—“You have not deserved this. You may","Emma"
"9623",158,"have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishment","Emma"
"9624",158,"beyond what you can have merited!—The kindness and protection of Mrs.","Emma"
"9625",158,"Elton!—‘Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.’ Heavens! Let me not suppose","Emma"
"9626",158,"that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!—But upon my honour,","Emma"
"9627",158,"there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman’s tongue!”","Emma"
"9628",158,"","Emma"
"9629",158,"Emma had not to listen to such paradings again—to any so exclusively","Emma"
"9630",158,"addressed to herself—so disgustingly decorated with a “dear Miss","Emma"
"9631",158,"Woodhouse.” The change on Mrs. Elton’s side soon afterwards appeared,","Emma"
"9632",158,"and she was left in peace—neither forced to be the very particular","Emma"
"9633",158,"friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton’s guidance, the very active","Emma"
"9634",158,"patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general","Emma"
"9635",158,"way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.","Emma"
"9636",158,"","Emma"
"9637",158,"She looked on with some amusement.—Miss Bates’s gratitude for Mrs.","Emma"
"9638",158,"Elton’s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless","Emma"
"9639",158,"simplicity and warmth. She was quite one of her worthies—the most","Emma"
"9640",158,"amiable, affable, delightful woman—just as accomplished and","Emma"
"9641",158,"condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma’s only","Emma"
"9642",158,"surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and","Emma"
"9643",158,"tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do. She heard of her walking with","Emma"
"9644",158,"the Eltons, sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons!","Emma"
"9645",158,"This was astonishing!—She could not have believed it possible that the","Emma"
"9646",158,"taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and","Emma"
"9647",158,"friendship as the Vicarage had to offer.","Emma"
"9648",158,"","Emma"
"9649",158,"“She is a riddle, quite a riddle!” said she.—“To chuse to remain here","Emma"
"9650",158,"month after month, under privations of every sort! And now to chuse the","Emma"
"9651",158,"mortification of Mrs. Elton’s notice and the penury of her","Emma"
"9652",158,"conversation, rather than return to the superior companions who have","Emma"
"9653",158,"always loved her with such real, generous affection.”","Emma"
"9654",158,"","Emma"
"9655",158,"Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells","Emma"
"9656",158,"were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had","Emma"
"9657",158,"promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh","Emma"
"9658",158,"invitations had arrived for her to join them there. According to Miss","Emma"
"9659",158,"Bates—it all came from her—Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly.","Emma"
"9660",158,"Would Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends","Emma"
"9661",158,"contrived—no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she had","Emma"
"9662",158,"declined it!","Emma"
"9663",158,"","Emma"
"9664",158,"“She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing","Emma"
"9665",158,"this invitation,” was Emma’s conclusion. “She must be under some sort","Emma"
"9666",158,"of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There is","Emma"
"9667",158,"great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.—She is _not_ to","Emma"
"9668",158,"be with the _Dixons_. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must","Emma"
"9669",158,"she consent to be with the Eltons?—Here is quite a separate puzzle.”","Emma"
"9670",158,"","Emma"
"9671",158,"Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before","Emma"
"9672",158,"the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this","Emma"
"9673",158,"apology for Jane.","Emma"
"9674",158,"","Emma"
"9675",158,"“We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage, my","Emma"
"9676",158,"dear Emma—but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a","Emma"
"9677",158,"good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We","Emma"
"9678",158,"must consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for","Emma"
"9679",158,"what she goes to.”","Emma"
"9680",158,"","Emma"
"9681",158,"“You are right, Mrs. Weston,” said Mr. Knightley warmly, “Miss Fairfax","Emma"
"9682",158,"is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.","Emma"
"9683",158,"Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen","Emma"
"9684",158,"her. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives attentions","Emma"
"9685",158,"from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.”","Emma"
"9686",158,"","Emma"
"9687",158,"Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; and she","Emma"
"9688",158,"was herself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she presently","Emma"

"9690",158,"","Emma"
"9691",158,"“Such attentions as Mrs. Elton’s, I should have imagined, would rather","Emma"
"9692",158,"disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton’s invitations I should","Emma"
"9693",158,"have imagined any thing but inviting.”","Emma"
"9694",158,"","Emma"
"9695",158,"“I should not wonder,” said Mrs. Weston, “if Miss Fairfax were to have","Emma"
"9696",158,"been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt’s eagerness in","Emma"
"9697",158,"accepting Mrs. Elton’s civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates may very","Emma"
"9698",158,"likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater","Emma"
"9699",158,"appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, in","Emma"
"9700",158,"spite of the very natural wish of a little change.”","Emma"
"9701",158,"","Emma"
"9702",158,"Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few","Emma"
"9703",158,"minutes silence, he said,","Emma"
"9704",158,"","Emma"
"9705",158,"“Another thing must be taken into consideration too—Mrs. Elton does not","Emma"
"9706",158,"talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her. We all know the","Emma"
"9707",158,"difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest spoken","Emma"
"9708",158,"amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common","Emma"
"9709",158,"civility in our personal intercourse with each other—a something more","Emma"
"9710",158,"early implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we","Emma"
"9711",158,"may have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently.","Emma"
"9712",158,"And besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be","Emma"
"9713",158,"sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind","Emma"
"9714",158,"and manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the","Emma"
"9715",158,"respect which she has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably","Emma"
"9716",158,"never fell in Mrs. Elton’s way before—and no degree of vanity can","Emma"
"9717",158,"prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if","Emma"
"9718",158,"not in consciousness.”","Emma"
"9719",158,"","Emma"
"9720",158,"“I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,” said Emma. Little Henry","Emma"
"9721",158,"was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her","Emma"
"9722",158,"irresolute what else to say.","Emma"
"9723",158,"","Emma"
"9724",158,"“Yes,” he replied, “any body may know how highly I think of her.”","Emma"
"9725",158,"","Emma"
"9726",158,"“And yet,” said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon","Emma"
"9727",158,"stopping—it was better, however, to know the worst at once—she hurried","Emma"
"9728",158,"on—“And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it","Emma"
"9729",158,"is. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or","Emma"
"9730",158,"other.”","Emma"
"9731",158,"","Emma"
"9732",158,"Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick","Emma"
"9733",158,"leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, or","Emma"
"9734",158,"some other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,","Emma"
"9735",158,"","Emma"
"9736",158,"“Oh! are you there?—But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave me","Emma"
"9737",158,"a hint of it six weeks ago.”","Emma"
"9738",158,"","Emma"
"9739",158,"He stopped.—Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not","Emma"
"9740",158,"herself know what to think. In a moment he went on—","Emma"
"9741",158,"","Emma"
"9742",158,"“That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I dare","Emma"
"9743",158,"say, would not have me if I were to ask her—and I am very sure I shall","Emma"
"9744",158,"never ask her.”","Emma"
"9745",158,"","Emma"
"9746",158,"Emma returned her friend’s pressure with interest; and was pleased","Emma"
"9747",158,"enough to exclaim,","Emma"
"9748",158,"","Emma"
"9749",158,"“You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you.”","Emma"
"9750",158,"","Emma"
"9751",158,"He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful—and in a manner which","Emma"
"9752",158,"shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,","Emma"
"9753",158,"","Emma"
"9754",158,"“So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?”","Emma"
"9755",158,"","Emma"
"9756",158,"“No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making,","Emma"
"9757",158,"for me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just","Emma"
"9758",158,"now, meant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without","Emma"
"9759",158,"any idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the","Emma"
"9760",158,"smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You","Emma"
"9761",158,"would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were","Emma"
"9762",158,"married.”","Emma"
"9763",158,"","Emma"
"9764",158,"Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie was, “No,","Emma"
"9765",158,"Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take","Emma"
"9766",158,"me by surprize.—I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure","Emma"
"9767",158,"you.” And soon afterwards, “Jane Fairfax is a very charming young","Emma"
"9768",158,"woman—but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. She has","Emma"
"9769",158,"not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.”","Emma"
"9770",158,"","Emma"
"9771",158,"Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. “Well,” said","Emma"
"9772",158,"she, “and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?”","Emma"
"9773",158,"","Emma"
"9774",158,"“Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;","Emma"
"9775",158,"he asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to be wiser or","Emma"
"9776",158,"wittier than his neighbours.”","Emma"
"9777",158,"","Emma"
"9778",158,"“In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and","Emma"
"9779",158,"wittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles—what","Emma"
"9780",158,"she calls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deep enough","Emma"
"9781",158,"in familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley—what can she do for Mr.","Emma"
"9782",158,"Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her","Emma"
"9783",158,"civilities and consents to be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argument","Emma"
"9784",158,"weighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptation","Emma"
"9785",158,"of getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of","Emma"
"9786",158,"Miss Fairfax’s mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton’s","Emma"
"9787",158,"acknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her","Emma"
"9788",158,"being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding.","Emma"
"9789",158,"I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor","Emma"
"9790",158,"with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be","Emma"
"9791",158,"continually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring","Emma"
"9792",158,"her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful","Emma"
"9793",158,"exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.”","Emma"
"9794",158,"","Emma"
"9795",158,"“Jane Fairfax has feeling,” said Mr. Knightley—“I do not accuse her of","Emma"
"9796",158,"want of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strong—and her","Emma"
"9797",158,"temper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control;","Emma"
"9798",158,"but it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think, than","Emma"
"9799",158,"she used to be—And I love an open temper. No—till Cole alluded to my","Emma"
"9800",158,"supposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax","Emma"
"9801",158,"and conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always—but with no","Emma"
"9802",158,"thought beyond.”","Emma"
"9803",158,"","Emma"
"9804",158,"“Well, Mrs. Weston,” said Emma triumphantly when he left them, “what do","Emma"

"9806",158,"","Emma"
"9807",158,"“Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the","Emma"
"9808",158,"idea of _not_ being in love with her, that I should not wonder if it","Emma"

"9814",158,"CHAPTER XVI","Emma"
"9815",158,"","Emma"
"9816",158,"","Emma"
"9817",158,"Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was","Emma"
"9818",158,"disposed to pay him attention on his marriage. Dinner-parties and","Emma"
"9819",158,"evening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowed","Emma"
"9820",158,"in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were","Emma"
"9821",158,"never to have a disengaged day.","Emma"
"9822",158,"","Emma"
"9823",158,"“I see how it is,” said she. “I see what a life I am to lead among you.","Emma"
"9824",158,"Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quite","Emma"
"9825",158,"the fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing very","Emma"
"9826",158,"formidable. From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a","Emma"
"9827",158,"disengaged day!—A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have","Emma"
"9828",158,"been at a loss.”","Emma"
"9829",158,"","Emma"
"9830",158,"No invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits made evening-parties","Emma"
"9831",158,"perfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste for","Emma"
"9832",158,"dinners. She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at","Emma"
"9833",158,"the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury","Emma"
"9834",158,"card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a","Emma"
"9835",158,"good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon","Emma"
"9836",158,"shew them how every thing ought to be arranged. In the course of the","Emma"
"9837",158,"spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party—in","Emma"
"9838",158,"which her card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and","Emma"
"9839",158,"unbroken packs in the true style—and more waiters engaged for the","Emma"
"9840",158,"evening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the","Emma"
"9841",158,"refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.","Emma"
"9842",158,"","Emma"
"9843",158,"Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at","Emma"
"9844",158,"Hartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or she","Emma"
"9845",158,"should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful","Emma"
"9846",158,"resentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked about it for","Emma"
"9847",158,"ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the","Emma"
"9848",158,"usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,","Emma"
"9849",158,"with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.","Emma"
"9850",158,"","Emma"
"9851",158,"The persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides the Eltons,","Emma"
"9852",158,"it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of","Emma"
"9853",158,"course—and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must","Emma"
"9854",158,"be asked to make the eighth:—but this invitation was not given with","Emma"
"9855",158,"equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased","Emma"
"9856",158,"by Harriet’s begging to be allowed to decline it. “She would rather not","Emma"
"9857",158,"be in his company more than she could help. She was not yet quite able","Emma"
"9858",158,"to see him and his charming happy wife together, without feeling","Emma"
"9859",158,"uncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, she would","Emma"
"9860",158,"rather stay at home.” It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had","Emma"
"9861",158,"she deemed it possible enough for wishing. She was delighted with the","Emma"
"9862",158,"fortitude of her little friend—for fortitude she knew it was in her to","Emma"
"9863",158,"give up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the","Emma"
"9864",158,"very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.—","Emma"
"9865",158,"Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, she was","Emma"
"9866",158,"more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often","Emma"
"9867",158,"been.—Mr. Knightley’s words dwelt with her. He had said that Jane","Emma"
"9868",158,"Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her.","Emma"
"9869",158,"","Emma"
"9870",158,"“This is very true,” said she, “at least as far as relates to me, which","Emma"
"9871",158,"was all that was meant—and it is very shameful.—Of the same age—and","Emma"
"9872",158,"always knowing her—I ought to have been more her friend.—She will never","Emma"
"9873",158,"like me now. I have neglected her too long. But I will shew her greater","Emma"
"9874",158,"attention than I have done.”","Emma"
"9875",158,"","Emma"
"9876",158,"Every invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and all","Emma"
"9877",158,"happy.—The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet","Emma"
"9878",158,"over. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two eldest little","Emma"
"9879",158,"Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some","Emma"
"9880",158,"weeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and","Emma"
"9881",158,"staying one whole day at Hartfield—which one day would be the very day","Emma"
"9882",158,"of this party.—His professional engagements did not allow of his being","Emma"
"9883",158,"put off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening","Emma"
"9884",158,"so. Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the","Emma"
"9885",158,"utmost that his nerves could bear—and here would be a ninth—and Emma","Emma"
"9886",158,"apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not","Emma"
"9887",158,"being able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without","Emma"
"9888",158,"falling in with a dinner-party.","Emma"
"9889",158,"","Emma"
"9890",158,"She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by","Emma"
"9891",158,"representing that though he certainly would make them nine, yet he","Emma"
"9892",158,"always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very","Emma"
"9893",158,"immaterial. She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to","Emma"
"9894",158,"have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her","Emma"
"9895",158,"instead of his brother.","Emma"
"9896",158,"","Emma"
"9897",158,"The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. John","Emma"
"9898",158,"Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and","Emma"
"9899",158,"must be absent on the very day. He might be able to join them in the","Emma"
"9900",158,"evening, but certainly not to dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease;","Emma"
"9901",158,"and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and the","Emma"
"9902",158,"philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed the","Emma"
"9903",158,"chief of even Emma’s vexation.","Emma"
"9904",158,"","Emma"
"9905",158,"The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John","Emma"
"9906",158,"Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being","Emma"
"9907",158,"agreeable. Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they","Emma"
"9908",158,"waited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton, as","Emma"
"9909",158,"elegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in","Emma"
"9910",158,"silence—wanting only to observe enough for Isabella’s information—but","Emma"
"9911",158,"Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could","Emma"
"9912",158,"talk to her. He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a","Emma"
"9913",158,"walk with his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain. It","Emma"
"9914",158,"was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,","Emma"
"9915",158,"","Emma"
"9916",158,"“I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am","Emma"
"9917",158,"sure you must have been wet.—We scarcely got home in time. I hope you","Emma"
"9918",158,"turned directly.”","Emma"
"9919",158,"","Emma"
"9920",158,"“I went only to the post-office,” said she, “and reached home before","Emma"
"9921",158,"the rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters","Emma"
"9922",158,"when I am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. A","Emma"
"9923",158,"walk before breakfast does me good.”","Emma"
"9924",158,"","Emma"
"9925",158,"“Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.”","Emma"
"9926",158,"","Emma"
"9927",158,"“No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.”","Emma"
"9928",158,"","Emma"
"9929",158,"Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,","Emma"
"9930",158,"","Emma"
"9931",158,"“That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six","Emma"
"9932",158,"yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and","Emma"
"9933",158,"Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before.","Emma"
"9934",158,"The post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When you","Emma"
"9935",158,"have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth","Emma"
"9936",158,"going through the rain for.”","Emma"
"9937",158,"","Emma"
"9938",158,"There was a little blush, and then this answer,","Emma"
"9939",158,"","Emma"
"9940",158,"“I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every","Emma"
"9941",158,"dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing","Emma"
"9942",158,"older should make me indifferent about letters.”","Emma"
"9943",158,"","Emma"
"9944",158,"“Indifferent! Oh! no—I never conceived you could become indifferent.","Emma"
"9945",158,"Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very","Emma"
"9946",158,"positive curse.”","Emma"
"9947",158,"","Emma"
"9948",158,"“You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of","Emma"
"9949",158,"friendship.”","Emma"
"9950",158,"","Emma"
"9951",158,"“I have often thought them the worst of the two,” replied he coolly.","Emma"
"9952",158,"“Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.”","Emma"
"9953",158,"","Emma"
"9954",158,"“Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well—I am","Emma"
"9955",158,"very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body. I","Emma"
"9956",158,"can easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than","Emma"
"9957",158,"to me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes","Emma"
"9958",158,"the difference, it is not age, but situation. You have every body","Emma"
"9959",158,"dearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again; and","Emma"
"9960",158,"therefore till I have outlived all my affections, a post-office, I","Emma"
"9961",158,"think, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather than","Emma"
"9962",158,"to-day.”","Emma"
"9963",158,"","Emma"
"9964",158,"“When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of","Emma"
"9965",158,"years,” said John Knightley, “I meant to imply the change of situation","Emma"
"9966",158,"which time usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Time","Emma"
"9967",158,"will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the","Emma"
"9968",158,"daily circle—but that is not the change I had in view for you. As an","Emma"
"9969",158,"old friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years","Emma"
"9970",158,"hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have.”","Emma"
"9971",158,"","Emma"
"9972",158,"It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant “thank","Emma"
"9973",158,"you” seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tear","Emma"
"9974",158,"in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Her attention was","Emma"
"9975",158,"now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on","Emma"
"9976",158,"such occasions, making the circle of his guests, and paying his","Emma"
"9977",158,"particular compliments to the ladies, was ending with her—and with all","Emma"
"9978",158,"his mildest urbanity, said,","Emma"
"9979",158,"","Emma"
"9980",158,"“I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning","Emma"
"9981",158,"in the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.—Young ladies","Emma"
"9982",158,"are delicate plants. They should take care of their health and their","Emma"
"9983",158,"complexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?”","Emma"
"9984",158,"","Emma"
"9985",158,"“Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind","Emma"
"9986",158,"solicitude about me.”","Emma"
"9987",158,"","Emma"
"9988",158,"“My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.—I","Emma"
"9989",158,"hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my very","Emma"
"9990",158,"old friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. You","Emma"
"9991",158,"do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and I are","Emma"
"9992",158,"both highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatest","Emma"
"9993",158,"satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.”","Emma"
"9994",158,"","Emma"

"9998",158,"By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and her","Emma"
"9999",158,"remonstrances now opened upon Jane.","Emma"
"10000",158,"","Emma"
"10001",158,"“My dear Jane, what is this I hear?—Going to the post-office in the","Emma"
"10002",158,"rain!—This must not be, I assure you.—You sad girl, how could you do","Emma"
"10003",158,"such a thing?—It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.”","Emma"
"10004",158,"","Emma"
"10005",158,"Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.","Emma"
"10006",158,"","Emma"
"10007",158,"“Oh! do not tell _me_. You really are a very sad girl, and do not know","Emma"
"10008",158,"how to take care of yourself.—To the post-office indeed! Mrs. Weston,","Emma"
"10009",158,"did you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert our","Emma"
"10010",158,"authority.”","Emma"
"10011",158,"","Emma"
"10012",158,"“My advice,” said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, “I certainly do","Emma"
"10013",158,"feel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.—Liable","Emma"
"10014",158,"as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly","Emma"
"10015",158,"careful, especially at this time of year. The spring I always think","Emma"
"10016",158,"requires more than common care. Better wait an hour or two, or even","Emma"
"10017",158,"half a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your","Emma"
"10018",158,"cough again. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are","Emma"
"10019",158,"much too reasonable. You look as if you would not do such a thing","Emma"
"10020",158,"again.”","Emma"
"10021",158,"","Emma"
"10022",158,"“Oh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,” eagerly rejoined Mrs.","Emma"
"10023",158,"Elton. “We will not allow her to do such a thing again:”—and nodding","Emma"
"10024",158,"significantly—“there must be some arrangement made, there must indeed.","Emma"
"10025",158,"I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning","Emma"
"10026",158,"(one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire for yours too and","Emma"
"10027",158,"bring them to you. That will obviate all difficulties you know; and","Emma"
"10028",158,"from _us_ I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to","Emma"
"10029",158,"accept such an accommodation.”","Emma"
"10030",158,"","Emma"
"10031",158,"“You are extremely kind,” said Jane; “but I cannot give up my early","Emma"
"10032",158,"walk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk","Emma"
"10033",158,"somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have","Emma"
"10034",158,"scarcely ever had a bad morning before.”","Emma"
"10035",158,"","Emma"
"10036",158,"“My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, that is","Emma"
"10037",158,"(laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thing","Emma"
"10038",158,"without the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston,","Emma"
"10039",158,"you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flatter","Emma"
"10040",158,"myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If I","Emma"
"10041",158,"meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as","Emma"
"10042",158,"settled.”","Emma"
"10043",158,"","Emma"
"10044",158,"“Excuse me,” said Jane earnestly, “I cannot by any means consent to","Emma"
"10045",158,"such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If the","Emma"
"10046",158,"errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is","Emma"

"10051",158,"","Emma"
"10052",158,"Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of","Emma"
"10053",158,"answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.","Emma"
"10054",158,"","Emma"
"10055",158,"“The post-office is a wonderful establishment!” said she.—“The","Emma"
"10056",158,"regularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do,","Emma"
"10057",158,"and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!”","Emma"
"10058",158,"","Emma"
"10059",158,"“It is certainly very well regulated.”","Emma"
"10060",158,"","Emma"
"10061",158,"“So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that a","Emma"
"10062",158,"letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the","Emma"
"10063",158,"kingdom, is even carried wrong—and not one in a million, I suppose,","Emma"
"10064",158,"actually lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad","Emma"
"10065",158,"hands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder.”","Emma"
"10066",158,"","Emma"
"10067",158,"“The clerks grow expert from habit.—They must begin with some quickness","Emma"
"10068",158,"of sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you want any farther","Emma"
"10069",158,"explanation,” continued he, smiling, “they are paid for it. That is the","Emma"
"10070",158,"key to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and must be served","Emma"
"10071",158,"well.”","Emma"
"10072",158,"","Emma"
"10073",158,"The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual","Emma"
"10074",158,"observations made.","Emma"
"10075",158,"","Emma"
"10076",158,"“I have heard it asserted,” said John Knightley, “that the same sort of","Emma"
"10077",158,"handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master","Emma"
"10078",158,"teaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imagine","Emma"
"10079",158,"the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have","Emma"
"10080",158,"very little teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand","Emma"
"10081",158,"they can get. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. I","Emma"
"10082",158,"have not always known their writing apart.”","Emma"
"10083",158,"","Emma"
"10084",158,"“Yes,” said his brother hesitatingly, “there is a likeness. I know what","Emma"
"10085",158,"you mean—but Emma’s hand is the strongest.”","Emma"
"10086",158,"","Emma"
"10087",158,"“Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,” said Mr. Woodhouse; “and","Emma"
"10088",158,"always did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston”—with half a sigh and half a","Emma"
"10089",158,"smile at her.","Emma"
"10090",158,"","Emma"
"10091",158,"“I never saw any gentleman’s handwriting”—Emma began, looking also at","Emma"
"10092",158,"Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending","Emma"
"10093",158,"to some one else—and the pause gave her time to reflect, “Now, how am I","Emma"
"10094",158,"going to introduce him?—Am I unequal to speaking his name at once","Emma"
"10095",158,"before all these people? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout","Emma"
"10096",158,"phrase?—Your Yorkshire friend—your correspondent in Yorkshire;—that","Emma"
"10097",158,"would be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.—No, I can pronounce","Emma"
"10098",158,"his name without the smallest distress. I certainly get better and","Emma"
"10099",158,"better.—Now for it.”","Emma"
"10100",158,"","Emma"
"10101",158,"Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again—“Mr. Frank Churchill","Emma"
"10102",158,"writes one of the best gentleman’s hands I ever saw.”","Emma"
"10103",158,"","Emma"
"10104",158,"“I do not admire it,” said Mr. Knightley. “It is too small—wants","Emma"
"10105",158,"strength. It is like a woman’s writing.”","Emma"
"10106",158,"","Emma"
"10107",158,"This was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him against","Emma"
"10108",158,"the base aspersion. “No, it by no means wanted strength—it was not a","Emma"
"10109",158,"large hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs. Weston","Emma"
"10110",158,"any letter about her to produce?” No, she had heard from him very","Emma"
"10111",158,"lately, but having answered the letter, had put it away.","Emma"
"10112",158,"","Emma"
"10113",158,"“If we were in the other room,” said Emma, “if I had my writing-desk, I","Emma"
"10114",158,"am sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note of his.—Do not you","Emma"

"10125",158,"","Emma"
"10126",158,"Dinner was on table.—Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to, was","Emma"
"10127",158,"ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be","Emma"
"10128",158,"allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying—","Emma"

"10133",158,"She had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether","Emma"
"10134",158,"the wet walk of this morning had produced any. She suspected that it","Emma"

"10136",158,"full expectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had","Emma"

"10139",158,"","Emma"
"10140",158,"She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the","Emma"

"10152",158,"","Emma"
"10153",158,"When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found","Emma"
"10154",158,"it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;—with","Emma"
"10155",158,"so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross","Emma"
"10156",158,"Jane Fairfax and slight herself. She and Mrs. Weston were obliged to be","Emma"
"10157",158,"almost always either talking together or silent together. Mrs. Elton","Emma"
"10158",158,"left them no choice. If Jane repressed her for a little time, she soon","Emma"
"10159",158,"began again; and though much that passed between them was in a","Emma"
"10160",158,"half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton’s side, there was no avoiding a","Emma"
"10161",158,"knowledge of their principal subjects: The post-office—catching","Emma"
"10162",158,"cold—fetching letters—and friendship, were long under discussion; and","Emma"
"10163",158,"to them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant to","Emma"
"10164",158,"Jane—inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to","Emma"
"10165",158,"suit her, and professions of Mrs. Elton’s meditated activity.","Emma"
"10166",158,"","Emma"
"10167",158,"“Here is April come!” said she, “I get quite anxious about you. June","Emma"
"10168",158,"will soon be here.”","Emma"
"10169",158,"","Emma"
"10170",158,"“But I have never fixed on June or any other month—merely looked","Emma"
"10171",158,"forward to the summer in general.”","Emma"
"10172",158,"","Emma"
"10173",158,"“But have you really heard of nothing?”","Emma"
"10174",158,"","Emma"
"10175",158,"“I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.”","Emma"
"10176",158,"","Emma"
"10177",158,"“Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the","Emma"
"10178",158,"difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.”","Emma"
"10179",158,"","Emma"
"10180",158,"“I not aware!” said Jane, shaking her head; “dear Mrs. Elton, who can","Emma"
"10181",158,"have thought of it as I have done?”","Emma"
"10182",158,"","Emma"
"10183",158,"“But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know","Emma"
"10184",158,"how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations. I saw","Emma"
"10185",158,"a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin of","Emma"
"10186",158,"Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; every","Emma"
"10187",158,"body was anxious to be in her family, for she moves in the first","Emma"
"10188",158,"circle. Wax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable!","Emma"
"10189",158,"Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge’s is the one I would most wish","Emma"
"10190",158,"to see you in.”","Emma"
"10191",158,"","Emma"
"10192",158,"“Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,” said","Emma"
"10193",158,"Jane. “I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will want","Emma"
"10194",158,"it;—afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But I would","Emma"

"10196",158,"","Emma"
"10197",158,"“Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me","Emma"
"10198",158,"trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be","Emma"
"10199",158,"more interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in","Emma"
"10200",158,"a day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-out","Emma"
"10201",158,"for any thing eligible.”","Emma"
"10202",158,"","Emma"
"10203",158,"“Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her;","Emma"
"10204",158,"till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body","Emma"
"10205",158,"trouble.”","Emma"
"10206",158,"","Emma"
"10207",158,"“But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June,","Emma"
"10208",158,"or say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before","Emma"
"10209",158,"us. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you","Emma"
"10210",158,"deserve, and your friends would require for you, is no everyday","Emma"
"10211",158,"occurrence, is not obtained at a moment’s notice; indeed, indeed, we","Emma"
"10212",158,"must begin inquiring directly.”","Emma"
"10213",158,"","Emma"
"10214",158,"“Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no","Emma"
"10215",158,"inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends.","Emma"
"10216",158,"When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of","Emma"
"10217",158,"being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry","Emma"
"10218",158,"would soon produce something—Offices for the sale—not quite of human","Emma"
"10219",158,"flesh—but of human intellect.”","Emma"
"10220",158,"","Emma"
"10221",158,"“Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at","Emma"
"10222",158,"the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend","Emma"
"10223",158,"to the abolition.”","Emma"
"10224",158,"","Emma"
"10225",158,"“I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,” replied Jane;","Emma"
"10226",158,"“governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely","Emma"
"10227",158,"different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to","Emma"
"10228",158,"the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies. But I","Emma"
"10229",158,"only mean to say that there are advertising offices, and that by","Emma"
"10230",158,"applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with","Emma"
"10231",158,"something that would do.”","Emma"
"10232",158,"","Emma"
"10233",158,"“Something that would do!” repeated Mrs. Elton. “Aye, _that_ may suit","Emma"
"10234",158,"your humble ideas of yourself;—I know what a modest creature you are;","Emma"
"10235",158,"but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any","Emma"
"10236",158,"thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family","Emma"
"10237",158,"not moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of","Emma"
"10238",158,"life.”","Emma"
"10239",158,"","Emma"
"10240",158,"“You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent; it","Emma"
"10241",158,"would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, I","Emma"
"10242",158,"think, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.","Emma"
"10243",158,"A gentleman’s family is all that I should condition for.”","Emma"
"10244",158,"","Emma"
"10245",158,"“I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall","Emma"
"10246",158,"be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite","Emma"
"10247",158,"on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the","Emma"
"10248",158,"first circle. Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name","Emma"
"10249",158,"your own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family","Emma"
"10250",158,"as much as you chose;—that is—I do not know—if you knew the harp, you","Emma"
"10251",158,"might do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;—yes, I","Emma"
"10252",158,"really believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what you","Emma"
"10253",158,"chose;—and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and","Emma"
"10254",158,"comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest.”","Emma"
"10255",158,"","Emma"
"10256",158,"“You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such a","Emma"
"10257",158,"situation together,” said Jane, “they are pretty sure to be equal;","Emma"
"10258",158,"however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at","Emma"
"10259",158,"present for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I am","Emma"
"10260",158,"obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing","Emma"
"10261",158,"nothing to be done till the summer. For two or three months longer I","Emma"
"10262",158,"shall remain where I am, and as I am.”","Emma"
"10263",158,"","Emma"
"10264",158,"“And I am quite serious too, I assure you,” replied Mrs. Elton gaily,","Emma"
"10265",158,"“in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to","Emma"
"10266",158,"watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.”","Emma"
"10267",158,"","Emma"
"10268",158,"In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till","Emma"
"10269",158,"Mr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change of","Emma"
"10270",158,"object, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,","Emma"
"10271",158,"","Emma"
"10272",158,"“Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!—Only think of his","Emma"
"10273",158,"gallantry in coming away before the other men!—what a dear creature he","Emma"
"10274",158,"is;—I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all that quaint,","Emma"
"10275",158,"old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;","Emma"
"10276",158,"modern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish","Emma"
"10277",158,"you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you I","Emma"
"10278",158,"began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I am","Emma"
"10279",158,"rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown. How do you like","Emma"
"10280",158,"it?—Selina’s choice—handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it is","Emma"
"10281",158,"not over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being","Emma"
"10282",158,"over-trimmed—quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments","Emma"
"10283",158,"now, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like","Emma"
"10284",158,"a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style of","Emma"
"10285",158,"dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the","Emma"
"10286",158,"minority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,—show","Emma"
"10287",158,"and finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting such a","Emma"
"10288",158,"trimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will","Emma"
"10289",158,"look well?”","Emma"
"10290",158,"","Emma"
"10291",158,"The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr.","Emma"
"10292",158,"Weston made his appearance among them. He had returned to a late","Emma"
"10293",158,"dinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He had been too","Emma"
"10294",158,"much expected by the best judges, for surprize—but there was great joy.","Emma"
"10295",158,"Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now, as he would have been","Emma"
"10296",158,"sorry to see him before. John Knightley only was in mute","Emma"
"10297",158,"astonishment.—That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at","Emma"
"10298",158,"home after a day of business in London, should set off again, and walk","Emma"
"10299",158,"half a mile to another man’s house, for the sake of being in mixed","Emma"
"10300",158,"company till bed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civility","Emma"
"10301",158,"and the noise of numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply. A","Emma"
"10302",158,"man who had been in motion since eight o’clock in the morning, and","Emma"
"10303",158,"might now have been still, who had been long talking, and might have","Emma"
"10304",158,"been silent, who had been in more than one crowd, and might have been","Emma"
"10305",158,"alone!—Such a man, to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own","Emma"
"10306",158,"fireside, and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again","Emma"
"10307",158,"into the world!—Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken","Emma"
"10308",158,"back his wife, there would have been a motive; but his coming would","Emma"
"10309",158,"probably prolong rather than break up the party. John Knightley looked","Emma"
"10310",158,"at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said, “I could","Emma"
"10311",158,"not have believed it even of _him_.”","Emma"
"10312",158,"","Emma"
"10313",158,"Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was","Emma"
"10314",158,"exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of being","Emma"
"10315",158,"principal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, was","Emma"
"10316",158,"making himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the","Emma"
"10317",158,"inquiries of his wife as to his dinner, convincing her that none of all","Emma"
"10318",158,"her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spread","Emma"
"10319",158,"abroad what public news he had heard, was proceeding to a family","Emma"
"10320",158,"communication, which, though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, he","Emma"
"10321",158,"had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in","Emma"
"10322",158,"the room. He gave her a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he","Emma"
"10323",158,"had met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.","Emma"
"10324",158,"","Emma"
"10325",158,"“Read it, read it,” said he, “it will give you pleasure; only a few","Emma"
"10326",158,"lines—will not take you long; read it to Emma.”","Emma"
"10327",158,"","Emma"
"10328",158,"The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking","Emma"
"10329",158,"to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible","Emma"
"10330",158,"to every body.","Emma"
"10331",158,"","Emma"
"10332",158,"“Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you say","Emma"
"10333",158,"to it?—I always told you he would be here again soon, did not I?—Anne,","Emma"
"10334",158,"my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe me?—In","Emma"
"10335",158,"town next week, you see—at the latest, I dare say; for _she_ is as","Emma"
"10336",158,"impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most","Emma"
"10337",158,"likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As to her illness, all","Emma"
"10338",158,"nothing of course. But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us","Emma"
"10339",158,"again, so near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come,","Emma"
"10340",158,"and he will be half his time with us. This is precisely what I wanted.","Emma"
"10341",158,"Well, pretty good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read","Emma"
"10342",158,"it all? Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some","Emma"
"10343",158,"other time, but it will not do now. I shall only just mention the","Emma"
"10344",158,"circumstance to the others in a common way.”","Emma"
"10345",158,"","Emma"
"10346",158,"Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her looks and","Emma"
"10347",158,"words had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she knew she was","Emma"
"10348",158,"happy, and knew she ought to be happy. Her congratulations were warm","Emma"
"10349",158,"and open; but Emma could not speak so fluently. _She_ was a little","Emma"
"10350",158,"occupied in weighing her own feelings, and trying to understand the","Emma"
"10351",158,"degree of her agitation, which she rather thought was considerable.","Emma"
"10352",158,"","Emma"
"10353",158,"Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative","Emma"
"10354",158,"to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,","Emma"
"10355",158,"and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial","Emma"
"10356",158,"communication of what the whole room must have overheard already.","Emma"
"10357",158,"","Emma"
"10358",158,"It was well that he took every body’s joy for granted, or he might not","Emma"
"10359",158,"have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly","Emma"
"10360",158,"delighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to","Emma"
"10361",158,"be made happy;—from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but","Emma"
"10362",158,"she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have","Emma"
"10363",158,"been too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs.","Emma"
"10364",158,"Elton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the","Emma"
"10365",158,"subject with her.","Emma"

"10372",158,"","Emma"
"10373",158,"“I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,”","Emma"
"10374",158,"said Mr. Weston.","Emma"
"10375",158,"","Emma"
"10376",158,"Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended","Emma"
"10377",158,"her by such a hope, smiled most graciously.","Emma"
"10378",158,"","Emma"
"10379",158,"“You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,” he","Emma"
"10380",158,"continued—“and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name.”","Emma"
"10381",158,"","Emma"
"10382",158,"“Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am sure Mr.","Emma"
"10383",158,"Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both have great","Emma"
"10384",158,"pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.”","Emma"
"10385",158,"","Emma"
"10386",158,"“You are very obliging.—Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.— He","Emma"
"10387",158,"is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in a","Emma"
"10388",158,"letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my","Emma"
"10389",158,"son’s hand, presumed to open it—though it was not directed to me—it was","Emma"
"10390",158,"to Mrs. Weston. She is his principal correspondent, I assure you. I","Emma"
"10391",158,"hardly ever get a letter.”","Emma"
"10392",158,"","Emma"
"10393",158,"“And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr.","Emma"
"10394",158,"Weston—(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.—A most","Emma"
"10395",158,"dangerous precedent indeed!—I beg you will not let your neighbours","Emma"
"10396",158,"follow your example.—Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, we","Emma"
"10397",158,"married women must begin to exert ourselves!—Oh! Mr. Weston, I could","Emma"
"10398",158,"not have believed it of you!”","Emma"
"10399",158,"","Emma"
"10400",158,"“Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs.","Emma"
"10401",158,"Elton.—This letter tells us—it is a short letter—written in a hurry,","Emma"
"10402",158,"merely to give us notice—it tells us that they are all coming up to","Emma"
"10403",158,"town directly, on Mrs. Churchill’s account—she has not been well the","Emma"
"10404",158,"whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her—so they are all to","Emma"
"10405",158,"move southward without loss of time.”","Emma"
"10406",158,"","Emma"
"10407",158,"“Indeed!—from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?”","Emma"
"10408",158,"","Emma"
"10409",158,"“Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, a","Emma"
"10410",158,"considerable journey.”","Emma"
"10411",158,"","Emma"
"10412",158,"“Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther than","Emma"
"10413",158,"from Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people","Emma"
"10414",158,"of large fortune?—You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr.","Emma"
"10415",158,"Suckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me—but twice","Emma"
"10416",158,"in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four","Emma"
"10417",158,"horses.”","Emma"
"10418",158,"","Emma"
"10419",158,"“The evil of the distance from Enscombe,” said Mr. Weston, “is, that","Emma"
"10420",158,"Mrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave the","Emma"
"10421",158,"sofa for a week together. In Frank’s last letter she complained, he","Emma"
"10422",158,"said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having","Emma"
"10423",158,"both his arm and his uncle’s! This, you know, speaks a great degree of","Emma"
"10424",158,"weakness—but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means to","Emma"
"10425",158,"sleep only two nights on the road.—So Frank writes word. Certainly,","Emma"
"10426",158,"delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton. You","Emma"
"10427",158,"must grant me that.”","Emma"
"10428",158,"","Emma"
"10429",158,"“No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take the part of my","Emma"
"10430",158,"own sex. I do indeed. I give you notice—You will find me a formidable","Emma"
"10431",158,"antagonist on that point. I always stand up for women—and I assure you,","Emma"
"10432",158,"if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you","Emma"
"10433",158,"would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill’s making incredible exertions to","Emma"
"10434",158,"avoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to her—and I believe I have","Emma"
"10435",158,"caught a little of her nicety. She always travels with her own sheets;","Emma"
"10436",158,"an excellent precaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?”","Emma"
"10437",158,"","Emma"
"10438",158,"“Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine","Emma"
"10439",158,"lady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the","Emma"
"10440",158,"land for”—","Emma"
"10441",158,"","Emma"
"10442",158,"Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,","Emma"
"10443",158,"","Emma"
"10444",158,"“Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assure","Emma"
"10445",158,"you. Do not run away with such an idea.”","Emma"
"10446",158,"","Emma"
"10447",158,"“Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough","Emma"
"10448",158,"a fine lady as any body ever beheld.”","Emma"
"10449",158,"","Emma"
"10450",158,"Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.","Emma"
"10451",158,"It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was","Emma"
"10452",158,"_not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of","Emma"
"10453",158,"it;—and she was considering in what way she had best retract, when Mr.","Emma"
"10454",158,"Weston went on.","Emma"
"10455",158,"","Emma"
"10456",158,"“Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect—but","Emma"
"10457",158,"this is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank, and","Emma"
"10458",158,"therefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of health","Emma"
"10459",158,"now; but _that_ indeed, by her own account, she has always been. I","Emma"
"10460",158,"would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith","Emma"
"10461",158,"in Mrs. Churchill’s illness.”","Emma"
"10462",158,"","Emma"
"10463",158,"“If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?—To Bath, or to","Emma"
"10464",158,"Clifton?” “She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for","Emma"
"10465",158,"her. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She has now","Emma"
"10466",158,"been a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she","Emma"
"10467",158,"begins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very","Emma"
"10468",158,"retired.”","Emma"
"10469",158,"","Emma"
"10470",158,"“Aye—like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired from","Emma"
"10471",158,"the road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all round it! You","Emma"
"10472",158,"seem shut out from every thing—in the most complete retirement.—And","Emma"
"10473",158,"Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy","Emma"
"10474",158,"that sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she may not have resources enough","Emma"
"10475",158,"in herself to be qualified for a country life. I always say a woman","Emma"
"10476",158,"cannot have too many resources—and I feel very thankful that I have so","Emma"
"10477",158,"many myself as to be quite independent of society.”","Emma"
"10478",158,"","Emma"
"10479",158,"“Frank was here in February for a fortnight.”","Emma"
"10480",158,"","Emma"
"10481",158,"“So I remember to have heard. He will find an _addition_ to the society","Emma"
"10482",158,"of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume to call","Emma"
"10483",158,"myself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard of there being","Emma"
"10484",158,"such a creature in the world.”","Emma"
"10485",158,"","Emma"
"10486",158,"This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr.","Emma"
"10487",158,"Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,","Emma"
"10488",158,"","Emma"
"10489",158,"“My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing","Emma"
"10490",158,"possible. Not heard of you!—I believe Mrs. Weston’s letters lately have","Emma"
"10491",158,"been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton.”","Emma"
"10492",158,"","Emma"
"10493",158,"He had done his duty and could return to his son.","Emma"
"10494",158,"","Emma"
"10495",158,"“When Frank left us,” continued he, “it was quite uncertain when we","Emma"
"10496",158,"might see him again, which makes this day’s news doubly welcome. It has","Emma"
"10497",158,"been completely unexpected. That is, _I_ always had a strong persuasion","Emma"
"10498",158,"he would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would turn","Emma"
"10499",158,"up—but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully","Emma"
"10500",158,"desponding. ‘How could he contrive to come? And how could it be","Emma"
"10501",158,"supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again?’ and so forth—I","Emma"
"10502",158,"always felt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has,","Emma"
"10503",158,"you see. I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if","Emma"
"10504",158,"things are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.”","Emma"
"10505",158,"","Emma"
"10506",158,"“Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say","Emma"
"10507",158,"to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when,","Emma"
"10508",158,"because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the","Emma"
"10509",158,"rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and","Emma"
"10510",158,"exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen’s","Emma"
"10511",158,"saffron robe would be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have been at to","Emma"
"10512",158,"dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! The","Emma"
"10513",158,"carriage—we had disappointments about the carriage;—one morning, I","Emma"
"10514",158,"remember, he came to me quite in despair.”","Emma"
"10515",158,"","Emma"
"10516",158,"She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly","Emma"
"10517",158,"seized the opportunity of going on.","Emma"
"10518",158,"","Emma"
"10519",158,"“You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill is","Emma"
"10520",158,"ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than","Emma"
"10521",158,"Enscombe—in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable","Emma"
"10522",158,"prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring—precisely the","Emma"
"10523",158,"season of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at","Emma"
"10524",158,"the longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and","Emma"
"10525",158,"never too hot for exercise. When he was here before, we made the best","Emma"
"10526",158,"of it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there","Emma"
"10527",158,"always is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we","Emma"
"10528",158,"intended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and I","Emma"
"10529",158,"do not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the","Emma"
"10530",158,"sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or","Emma"
"10531",158,"to-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than","Emma"
"10532",158,"having him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is the","Emma"
"10533",158,"state of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be","Emma"
"10534",158,"pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generally","Emma"
"10535",158,"thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston’s","Emma"
"10536",158,"partiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, most","Emma"
"10537",158,"gratifying to me. She thinks nobody equal to him.”","Emma"
"10538",158,"","Emma"
"10539",158,"“And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion","Emma"
"10540",158,"will be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr.","Emma"
"10541",158,"Frank Churchill.—At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one","Emma"
"10542",158,"of those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means","Emma"
"10543",158,"implicitly guided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son,","Emma"
"10544",158,"so I shall judge of him.—I am no flatterer.”","Emma"
"10545",158,"","Emma"
"10546",158,"Mr. Weston was musing.","Emma"
"10547",158,"","Emma"
"10548",158,"“I hope,” said he presently, “I have not been severe upon poor Mrs.","Emma"
"10549",158,"Churchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; but","Emma"
"10550",158,"there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me","Emma"
"10551",158,"to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be","Emma"
"10552",158,"ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the","Emma"
"10553",158,"treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of","Emma"
"10554",158,"it is to be laid to her. She was the instigator. Frank’s mother would","Emma"
"10555",158,"never have been slighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill has","Emma"
"10556",158,"pride; but his pride is nothing to his wife’s: his is a quiet,","Emma"
"10557",158,"indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody, and only","Emma"
"10558",158,"make himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her pride is arrogance","Emma"
"10559",158,"and insolence! And what inclines one less to bear, she has no fair","Emma"
"10560",158,"pretence of family or blood. She was nobody when he married her, barely","Emma"
"10561",158,"the daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her being turned into a","Emma"
"10562",158,"Churchill she has out-Churchill’d them all in high and mighty claims:","Emma"
"10563",158,"but in herself, I assure you, she is an upstart.”","Emma"
"10564",158,"","Emma"
"10565",158,"“Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite a","Emma"
"10566",158,"horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to","Emma"
"10567",158,"people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who","Emma"
"10568",158,"are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give","Emma"
"10569",158,"themselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them","Emma"
"10570",158,"directly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and","Emma"
"10571",158,"encumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense","Emma"
"10572",158,"airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old established","Emma"
"10573",158,"families. A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived","Emma"
"10574",158,"at West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They came","Emma"
"10575",158,"from Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr.","Emma"
"10576",158,"Weston. One has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is","Emma"
"10577",158,"something direful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of","Emma"
"10578",158,"the Tupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; and","Emma"
"10579",158,"yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my","Emma"
"10580",158,"brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearest","Emma"
"10581",158,"neighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven","Emma"
"10582",158,"years a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him—I","Emma"
"10583",158,"believe, at least—I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed","Emma"
"10584",158,"the purchase before his death.”","Emma"
"10585",158,"","Emma"
"10586",158,"They were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having","Emma"
"10587",158,"said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.","Emma"
"10588",158,"","Emma"
"10589",158,"After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr.","Emma"
"10590",158,"Woodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers,","Emma"
"10591",158,"and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed","Emma"
"10592",158,"little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which","Emma"
"10593",158,"nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry of","Emma"
"10594",158,"spirits which would have made her prefer being silent.","Emma"
"10595",158,"","Emma"
"10596",158,"Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was to","Emma"
"10597",158,"leave them early the next day; and he soon began with—","Emma"
"10598",158,"","Emma"
"10599",158,"“Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the","Emma"
"10600",158,"boys; but you have your sister’s letter, and every thing is down at","Emma"
"10601",158,"full length there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise","Emma"
"10602",158,"than her’s, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have","Emma"
"10603",158,"to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic","Emma"
"10604",158,"them.”","Emma"
"10605",158,"","Emma"
"10606",158,"“I rather hope to satisfy you both,” said Emma, “for I shall do all in","Emma"
"10607",158,"my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and","Emma"
"10608",158,"happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.”","Emma"
"10609",158,"","Emma"
"10610",158,"“And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.”","Emma"
"10611",158,"","Emma"
"10612",158,"“That is very likely. You think so, do not you?”","Emma"
"10613",158,"","Emma"
"10614",158,"“I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father—or even","Emma"
"10615",158,"may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue","Emma"
"10616",158,"to increase as much as they have done lately.”","Emma"
"10617",158,"","Emma"
"10618",158,"“Increase!”","Emma"
"10619",158,"","Emma"
"10620",158,"“Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a","Emma"
"10621",158,"great difference in your way of life.”","Emma"
"10622",158,"","Emma"
"10623",158,"“Difference! No indeed I am not.”","Emma"
"10624",158,"","Emma"
"10625",158,"“There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company","Emma"
"10626",158,"than you used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down for","Emma"
"10627",158,"only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!—When did it","Emma"
"10628",158,"happen before, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing,","Emma"
"10629",158,"and you mix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabella","Emma"
"10630",158,"brought an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole’s, or balls","Emma"
"10631",158,"at the Crown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in","Emma"
"10632",158,"your goings-on, is very great.”","Emma"
"10633",158,"","Emma"
"10634",158,"“Yes,” said his brother quickly, “it is Randalls that does it all.”","Emma"
"10635",158,"","Emma"
"10636",158,"“Very well—and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less","Emma"
"10637",158,"influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma,","Emma"
"10638",158,"that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, I","Emma"
"10639",158,"only beg you to send them home.”","Emma"
"10640",158,"","Emma"
"10641",158,"“No,” cried Mr. Knightley, “that need not be the consequence. Let them","Emma"
"10642",158,"be sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure.”","Emma"
"10643",158,"","Emma"
"10644",158,"“Upon my word,” exclaimed Emma, “you amuse me! I should like to know","Emma"
"10645",158,"how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being","Emma"
"10646",158,"of the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure","Emma"
"10647",158,"to attend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine—what","Emma"
"10648",158,"have they been? Dining once with the Coles—and having a ball talked of,","Emma"
"10649",158,"which never took place. I can understand you—(nodding at Mr. John","Emma"
"10650",158,"Knightley)—your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at","Emma"
"10651",158,"once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning","Emma"
"10652",158,"to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours","Emma"
"10653",158,"from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for","Emma"
"10654",158,"me, I cannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that","Emma"
"10655",158,"if Aunt Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much","Emma"
"10656",158,"better with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours","Emma"

"10671",158,"CHAPTER I","Emma"
"10672",158,"","Emma"
"10673",158,"","Emma"
"10674",158,"A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the","Emma"
"10675",158,"nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. She","Emma"
"10676",158,"was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all","Emma"
"10677",158,"apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him. Her own attachment had","Emma"
"10678",158,"really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;—but","Emma"
"10679",158,"if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the","Emma"
"10680",158,"two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he","Emma"
"10681",158,"had taken away, it would be very distressing. If a separation of two","Emma"
"10682",158,"months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils before","Emma"
"10683",158,"her:—caution for him and for herself would be necessary. She did not","Emma"
"10684",158,"mean to have her own affections entangled again, and it would be","Emma"
"10685",158,"incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.","Emma"
"10686",158,"","Emma"
"10687",158,"She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.","Emma"
"10688",158,"That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present","Emma"
"10689",158,"acquaintance! and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something","Emma"
"10690",158,"decisive. She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a","Emma"
"10691",158,"crisis, an event, a something to alter her present composed and","Emma"
"10692",158,"tranquil state.","Emma"
"10693",158,"","Emma"
"10694",158,"It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had","Emma"
"10695",158,"foreseen, before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank","Emma"
"10696",158,"Churchill’s feelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite so","Emma"
"10697",158,"soon as had been imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards.","Emma"
"10698",158,"He rode down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he","Emma"
"10699",158,"came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise","Emma"
"10700",158,"all her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was","Emma"
"10701",158,"influenced, and how she must act. They met with the utmost","Emma"
"10702",158,"friendliness. There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing","Emma"
"10703",158,"her. But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he","Emma"
"10704",158,"had done, of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree. She","Emma"
"10705",158,"watched him well. It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had","Emma"
"10706",158,"been. Absence, with the conviction probably of her indifference, had","Emma"
"10707",158,"produced this very natural and very desirable effect.","Emma"
"10708",158,"","Emma"
"10709",158,"He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed","Emma"
"10710",158,"delighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories: and","Emma"
"10711",158,"he was not without agitation. It was not in his calmness that she read","Emma"
"10712",158,"his comparative indifference. He was not calm; his spirits were","Emma"
"10713",158,"evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him. Lively as he","Emma"
"10714",158,"was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what","Emma"
"10715",158,"decided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a quarter of an","Emma"
"10716",158,"hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury. “He had seen a","Emma"
"10717",158,"group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed—he had not","Emma"
"10718",158,"stopped, he would not stop for more than a word—but he had the vanity","Emma"
"10719",158,"to think they would be disappointed if he did not call, and much as he","Emma"
"10720",158,"wished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off.” She had no","Emma"
"10721",158,"doubt as to his being less in love—but neither his agitated spirits,","Emma"
"10722",158,"nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure; and she was rather","Emma"
"10723",158,"inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power, and a","Emma"
"10724",158,"discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long.","Emma"
"10725",158,"","Emma"
"10726",158,"This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.","Emma"
"10727",158,"He was often hoping, intending to come—but was always prevented. His","Emma"
"10728",158,"aunt could not bear to have him leave her. Such was his own account at","Emma"
"10729",158,"Randall’s. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was","Emma"
"10730",158,"to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill’s removal to London had been of no","Emma"
"10731",158,"service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. That she was","Emma"
"10732",158,"really ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it,","Emma"
"10733",158,"at Randalls. Though much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he","Emma"
"10734",158,"looked back, that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been","Emma"
"10735",158,"half a year ago. He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that","Emma"
"10736",158,"care and medicine might not remove, or at least that she might not have","Emma"
"10737",158,"many years of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on,","Emma"
"10738",158,"by all his father’s doubts, to say that her complaints were merely","Emma"
"10739",158,"imaginary, or that she was as strong as ever.","Emma"
"10740",158,"","Emma"
"10741",158,"It soon appeared that London was not the place for her. She could not","Emma"
"10742",158,"endure its noise. Her nerves were under continual irritation and","Emma"
"10743",158,"suffering; and by the ten days’ end, her nephew’s letter to Randalls","Emma"
"10744",158,"communicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately to","Emma"
"10745",158,"Richmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of","Emma"
"10746",158,"an eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. A","Emma"
"10747",158,"ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit","Emma"
"10748",158,"expected from the change.","Emma"
"10749",158,"","Emma"
"10750",158,"Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,","Emma"
"10751",158,"and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months","Emma"
"10752",158,"before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends—for the","Emma"
"10753",158,"house was taken for May and June. She was told that now he wrote with","Emma"
"10754",158,"the greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he","Emma"
"10755",158,"could even wish.","Emma"
"10756",158,"","Emma"
"10757",158,"Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He was","Emma"
"10758",158,"considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered. She","Emma"
"10759",158,"hoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.","Emma"
"10760",158,"","Emma"
"10761",158,"Mr. Weston’s own happiness was indisputable. He was quite delighted. It","Emma"
"10762",158,"was the very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would be","Emma"
"10763",158,"really having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to a","Emma"
"10764",158,"young man?—An hour’s ride. He would be always coming over. The","Emma"
"10765",158,"difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make","Emma"
"10766",158,"the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never. Sixteen","Emma"
"10767",158,"miles—nay, eighteen—it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street—was a","Emma"
"10768",158,"serious obstacle. Were he ever able to get away, the day would be spent","Emma"
"10769",158,"in coming and returning. There was no comfort in having him in London;","Emma"
"10770",158,"he might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for","Emma"
"10771",158,"easy intercourse. Better than nearer!","Emma"
"10772",158,"","Emma"
"10773",158,"One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this","Emma"
"10774",158,"removal,—the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before, but","Emma"
"10775",158,"it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now,","Emma"
"10776",158,"however, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and","Emma"
"10777",158,"very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines","Emma"
"10778",158,"from Frank, to say that his aunt felt already much better for the","Emma"
"10779",158,"change, and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for","Emma"
"10780",158,"twenty-four hours at any given time, induced them to name as early a","Emma"
"10781",158,"day as possible.","Emma"
"10782",158,"","Emma"
"10783",158,"Mr. Weston’s ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood","Emma"
"10784",158,"between the young people of Highbury and happiness.","Emma"
"10785",158,"","Emma"
"10786",158,"Mr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him.","Emma"
"10787",158,"May was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged to","Emma"
"10788",158,"spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he sanguinely","Emma"
"10789",158,"hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have","Emma"
"10790",158,"any thing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone.","Emma"

"10797",158,"","Emma"
"10798",158,"No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached,","Emma"
"10799",158,"the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank","Emma"
"10800",158,"Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls","Emma"
"10801",158,"before dinner, and every thing was safe.","Emma"
"10802",158,"","Emma"
"10803",158,"No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The room at","Emma"
"10804",158,"the Crown was to witness it;—but it would be better than a common","Emma"
"10805",158,"meeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his","Emma"
"10806",158,"entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,","Emma"
"10807",158,"for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort","Emma"
"10808",158,"of the rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse","Emma"
"10809",158,"him, and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man’s","Emma"
"10810",158,"company. She was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good","Emma"
"10811",158,"time, the Randalls party just sufficiently before them.","Emma"
"10812",158,"","Emma"
"10813",158,"Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not","Emma"
"10814",158,"say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.","Emma"
"10815",158,"They all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it","Emma"
"10816",158,"should be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of","Emma"
"10817",158,"another carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first,","Emma"
"10818",158,"without great surprize. “So unreasonably early!” she was going to","Emma"
"10819",158,"exclaim; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends,","Emma"
"10820",158,"who were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr.","Emma"
"10821",158,"Weston’s judgment; and they were so very closely followed by another","Emma"
"10822",158,"carriage of cousins, who had been entreated to come early with the same","Emma"
"10823",158,"distinguishing earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if","Emma"
"10824",158,"half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of","Emma"
"10825",158,"preparatory inspection.","Emma"
"10826",158,"","Emma"
"10827",158,"Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr.","Emma"
"10828",158,"Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a","Emma"
"10829",158,"man who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first","Emma"
"10830",158,"distinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, but a","Emma"
"10831",158,"little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher","Emma"
"10832",158,"character.—General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a man","Emma"
"10833",158,"what he ought to be.—She could fancy such a man. The whole party walked","Emma"
"10834",158,"about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to","Emma"
"10835",158,"do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their","Emma"
"10836",158,"various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though _May_, a","Emma"
"10837",158,"fire in the evening was still very pleasant.","Emma"
"10838",158,"","Emma"
"10839",158,"Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston’s fault that the number of privy","Emma"
"10840",158,"councillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates’s door","Emma"
"10841",158,"to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be","Emma"
"10842",158,"brought by the Eltons.","Emma"
"10843",158,"","Emma"
"10844",158,"Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,","Emma"
"10845",158,"which shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going to","Emma"
"10846",158,"the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,—impatient","Emma"
"10847",158,"to begin, or afraid of being always near her.","Emma"
"10848",158,"","Emma"
"10849",158,"Mrs. Elton was spoken of. “I think she must be here soon,” said he. “I","Emma"
"10850",158,"have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her.","Emma"

"10852",158,"","Emma"

"10856",158,"“I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never seen","Emma"

"10858",158,"","Emma"
"10859",158,"Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties","Emma"
"10860",158,"passed.","Emma"
"10861",158,"","Emma"
"10862",158,"“But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!” said Mr. Weston, looking about. “We","Emma"
"10863",158,"thought you were to bring them.”","Emma"
"10864",158,"","Emma"
"10865",158,"The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma","Emma"
"10866",158,"longed to know what Frank’s first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how","Emma"
"10867",158,"he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of","Emma"
"10868",158,"graciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion,","Emma"
"10869",158,"by giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.","Emma"
"10870",158,"","Emma"
"10871",158,"In a few minutes the carriage returned.—Somebody talked of rain.—“I","Emma"
"10872",158,"will see that there are umbrellas, sir,” said Frank to his father:","Emma"
"10873",158,"“Miss Bates must not be forgotten:” and away he went. Mr. Weston was","Emma"
"10874",158,"following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion","Emma"
"10875",158,"of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself,","Emma"
"10876",158,"though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.","Emma"
"10877",158,"","Emma"
"10878",158,"“A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you","Emma"
"10879",158,"I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely","Emma"
"10880",158,"pleased with him.—You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him a","Emma"
"10881",158,"very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like and","Emma"
"10882",158,"approve—so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.","Emma"
"10883",158,"You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies—quite a horror of them.","Emma"
"10884",158,"They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor me","Emma"
"10885",158,"had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very","Emma"
"10886",158,"cutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them","Emma"
"10887",158,"much better.”","Emma"
"10888",158,"","Emma"
"10889",158,"While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston’s attention was chained; but","Emma"
"10890",158,"when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies","Emma"
"10891",158,"just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.","Emma"
"10892",158,"","Emma"
"10893",158,"Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. “I have no doubt of its being our","Emma"
"10894",158,"carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so","Emma"
"10895",158,"extremely expeditious!—I believe we drive faster than any body.—What a","Emma"
"10896",158,"pleasure it is to send one’s carriage for a friend!—I understand you","Emma"
"10897",158,"were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite","Emma"
"10898",158,"unnecessary. You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_.”","Emma"
"10899",158,"","Emma"
"10900",158,"Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into","Emma"
"10901",158,"the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs.","Emma"
"10902",158,"Weston’s to receive them. Her gestures and movements might be","Emma"
"10903",158,"understood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every","Emma"
"10904",158,"body’s words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates,","Emma"
"10905",158,"who came in talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes","Emma"
"10906",158,"after her being admitted into the circle at the fire. As the door","Emma"
"10907",158,"opened she was heard,","Emma"
"10908",158,"","Emma"
"10909",158,"“So very obliging of you!—No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not","Emma"
"10910",158,"care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares—Well!—(as soon as","Emma"
"10911",158,"she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!—This is","Emma"
"10912",158,"admirable!—Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could","Emma"
"10913",158,"not have imagined it.—So well lighted up!—Jane, Jane, look!—did you","Emma"
"10914",158,"ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin’s","Emma"
"10915",158,"lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her as","Emma"
"10916",158,"I came in; she was standing in the entrance. ‘Oh! Mrs. Stokes,’ said","Emma"
"10917",158,"I—but I had not time for more.” She was now met by Mrs. Weston.—“Very","Emma"
"10918",158,"well, I thank you, ma’am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear","Emma"
"10919",158,"it. So afraid you might have a headache!—seeing you pass by so often,","Emma"
"10920",158,"and knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it","Emma"
"10921",158,"indeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the","Emma"
"10922",158,"carriage!—excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the","Emma"
"10923",158,"horses a moment. Most comfortable carriage.—Oh! and I am sure our","Emma"
"10924",158,"thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most","Emma"
"10925",158,"kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.—But two such offers in","Emma"
"10926",158,"one day!—Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, ‘Upon my","Emma"
"10927",158,"word, ma’am—.’ Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr.","Emma"
"10928",158,"Woodhouse’s. I made her take her shawl—for the evenings are not","Emma"
"10929",158,"warm—her large new shawl— Mrs. Dixon’s wedding-present.—So kind of her","Emma"
"10930",158,"to think of my mother! Bought at Weymouth, you know—Mr. Dixon’s choice.","Emma"
"10931",158,"There were three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some","Emma"
"10932",158,"time. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you","Emma"
"10933",158,"sure you did not wet your feet?—It was but a drop or two, but I am so","Emma"
"10934",158,"afraid:—but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely—and there was a mat to","Emma"
"10935",158,"step upon—I shall never forget his extreme politeness.—Oh! Mr. Frank","Emma"
"10936",158,"Churchill, I must tell you my mother’s spectacles have never been in","Emma"
"10937",158,"fault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of","Emma"
"10938",158,"your good-nature. Does not she, Jane?—Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank","Emma"
"10939",158,"Churchill?—Ah! here’s Miss Woodhouse.—Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you","Emma"
"10940",158,"do?—Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite in","Emma"
"10941",158,"fairy-land!—Such a transformation!—Must not compliment, I know (eyeing","Emma"
"10942",158,"Emma most complacently)—that would be rude—but upon my word, Miss","Emma"
"10943",158,"Woodhouse, you do look—how do you like Jane’s hair?—You are a","Emma"
"10944",158,"judge.—She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her","Emma"
"10945",158,"hair!—No hairdresser from London I think could.—Ah! Dr. Hughes I","Emma"
"10946",158,"declare—and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a","Emma"
"10947",158,"moment.—How do you do? How do you do?—Very well, I thank you. This is","Emma"
"10948",158,"delightful, is not it?—Where’s dear Mr. Richard?—Oh! there he is. Don’t","Emma"
"10949",158,"disturb him. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How do","Emma"
"10950",158,"you do, Mr. Richard?—I saw you the other day as you rode through the","Emma"
"10951",158,"town—Mrs. Otway, I protest!—and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss","Emma"
"10952",158,"Caroline.—Such a host of friends!—and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!—How do","Emma"
"10953",158,"you do? How do you all do?—Quite well, I am much obliged to you. Never","Emma"
"10954",158,"better.—Don’t I hear another carriage?—Who can this be?—very likely the","Emma"
"10955",158,"worthy Coles.—Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about among","Emma"
"10956",158,"such friends! And such a noble fire!—I am quite roasted. No coffee, I","Emma"
"10957",158,"thank you, for me—never take coffee.—A little tea if you please, sir,","Emma"
"10958",158,"by and bye,—no hurry—Oh! here it comes. Every thing so good!”","Emma"
"10959",158,"","Emma"
"10960",158,"Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss","Emma"
"10961",158,"Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the","Emma"
"10962",158,"discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little","Emma"
"10963",158,"way behind her.—He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too, she","Emma"
"10964",158,"could not determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress","Emma"
"10965",158,"and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was","Emma"
"10966",158,"evidently wanting to be complimented herself—and it was, “How do you","Emma"
"10967",158,"like my gown?—How do you like my trimming?—How has Wright done my","Emma"
"10968",158,"hair?”—with many other relative questions, all answered with patient","Emma"
"10969",158,"politeness. Mrs. Elton then said, “Nobody can think less of dress in","Emma"
"10970",158,"general than I do—but upon such an occasion as this, when every body’s","Emma"
"10971",158,"eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons—who I have","Emma"
"10972",158,"no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour—I would not wish","Emma"
"10973",158,"to be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except","Emma"
"10974",158,"mine.—So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.—We shall","Emma"
"10975",158,"see if our styles suit.—A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.","Emma"
"10976",158,"I like him very well.”","Emma"
"10977",158,"","Emma"
"10978",158,"At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not","Emma"
"10979",158,"but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear","Emma"
"10980",158,"more;—and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till","Emma"
"10981",158,"another suspension brought Mrs. Elton’s tones again distinctly","Emma"
"10982",158,"forward.—Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,","Emma"
"10983",158,"","Emma"
"10984",158,"“Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?—I was","Emma"
"10985",158,"this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for","Emma"
"10986",158,"tidings of us.”","Emma"
"10987",158,"","Emma"
"10988",158,"“Jane!”—repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and","Emma"
"10989",158,"displeasure.—“That is easy—but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I","Emma"
"10990",158,"suppose.”","Emma"
"10991",158,"","Emma"
"10992",158,"“How do you like Mrs. Elton?” said Emma in a whisper.","Emma"
"10993",158,"","Emma"
"10994",158,"“Not at all.”","Emma"
"10995",158,"","Emma"
"10996",158,"“You are ungrateful.”","Emma"
"10997",158,"","Emma"
"10998",158,"“Ungrateful!—What do you mean?” Then changing from a frown to a","Emma"
"10999",158,"smile—“No, do not tell me—I do not want to know what you mean.—Where is","Emma"
"11000",158,"my father?—When are we to begin dancing?”","Emma"
"11001",158,"","Emma"
"11002",158,"Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He walked","Emma"
"11003",158,"off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and","Emma"
"11004",158,"Mrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be","Emma"
"11005",158,"laid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton","Emma"
"11006",158,"must be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which","Emma"
"11007",158,"interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.—Emma","Emma"
"11008",158,"heard the sad truth with fortitude.","Emma"
"11009",158,"","Emma"
"11010",158,"“And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?” said Mr. Weston.","Emma"
"11011",158,"“She will think Frank ought to ask her.”","Emma"
"11012",158,"","Emma"
"11013",158,"Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and","Emma"
"11014",158,"boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most","Emma"
"11015",158,"perfect approbation of—and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was","Emma"
"11016",158,"wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business","Emma"
"11017",158,"was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.—Mr.","Emma"
"11018",158,"Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss","Emma"
"11019",158,"Woodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,","Emma"
"11020",158,"though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was","Emma"
"11021",158,"almost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly","Emma"
"11022",158,"the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though","Emma"
"11023",158,"she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by","Emma"
"11024",158,"the change. Mr. Weston might be his son’s superior.—In spite of this","Emma"
"11025",158,"little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see","Emma"
"11026",158,"the respectable length of the set as it was forming, and to feel that","Emma"
"11027",158,"she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.—She was more","Emma"
"11028",158,"disturbed by Mr. Knightley’s not dancing than by any thing else.—There","Emma"
"11029",158,"he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be","Emma"
"11030",158,"dancing,—not classing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and","Emma"
"11031",158,"whist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance","Emma"
"11032",158,"till their rubbers were made up,—so young as he looked!—He could not","Emma"
"11033",158,"have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had","Emma"
"11034",158,"placed himself. His tall, firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms","Emma"
"11035",158,"and stooping shoulders of the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must","Emma"
"11036",158,"draw every body’s eyes; and, excepting her own partner, there was not","Emma"
"11037",158,"one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.—He","Emma"
"11038",158,"moved a few steps nearer, and those few steps were enough to prove in","Emma"
"11039",158,"how gentlemanlike a manner, with what natural grace, he must have","Emma"
"11040",158,"danced, would he but take the trouble.—Whenever she caught his eye, she","Emma"
"11041",158,"forced him to smile; but in general he was looking grave. She wished he","Emma"
"11042",158,"could love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.—He","Emma"
"11043",158,"seemed often observing her. She must not flatter herself that he","Emma"
"11044",158,"thought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she","Emma"
"11045",158,"did not feel afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and","Emma"
"11046",158,"her partner. They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers.","Emma"
"11047",158,"That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done, was","Emma"
"11048",158,"indubitable.","Emma"
"11049",158,"","Emma"
"11050",158,"The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant","Emma"
"11051",158,"attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed","Emma"
"11052",158,"happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom","Emma"
"11053",158,"bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in","Emma"
"11054",158,"the very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, very","Emma"
"11055",158,"recordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings","Emma"
"11056",158,"usually are. There was one, however, which Emma thought something","Emma"
"11057",158,"of.—The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no","Emma"
"11058",158,"partner;—the only young lady sitting down;—and so equal had been","Emma"
"11059",158,"hitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any one","Emma"
"11060",158,"disengaged was the wonder!—But Emma’s wonder lessened soon afterwards,","Emma"
"11061",158,"on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to dance","Emma"
"11062",158,"if it were possible to be avoided: she was sure he would not—and she","Emma"
"11063",158,"was expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room.","Emma"
"11064",158,"","Emma"
"11065",158,"Escape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the room","Emma"
"11066",158,"where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in","Emma"
"11067",158,"front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of","Emma"
"11068",158,"maintaining it. He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss","Emma"
"11069",158,"Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her.—Emma saw it. She was","Emma"
"11070",158,"not yet dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had","Emma"
"11071",158,"therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little","Emma"
"11072",158,"she saw it all. When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were","Emma"
"11073",158,"exactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch;","Emma"
"11074",158,"but Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue","Emma"
"11075",158,"which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she","Emma"
"11076",158,"perceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her, was","Emma"
"11077",158,"not only listening also, but even encouraging him by significant","Emma"
"11078",158,"glances.—The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join","Emma"
"11079",158,"him and say, “Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?” to which his prompt reply","Emma"
"11080",158,"was, “Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.”","Emma"
"11081",158,"","Emma"
"11082",158,"“Me!—oh! no—I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no","Emma"
"11083",158,"dancer.”","Emma"
"11084",158,"","Emma"
"11085",158,"“If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,” said he, “I shall have great","Emma"
"11086",158,"pleasure, I am sure—for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old","Emma"
"11087",158,"married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very","Emma"
"11088",158,"great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.","Emma"
"11089",158,"Gilbert.”","Emma"
"11090",158,"","Emma"
"11091",158,"“Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady","Emma"
"11092",158,"disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing—Miss Smith.” “Miss","Emma"
"11093",158,"Smith!—oh!—I had not observed.—You are extremely obliging—and if I were","Emma"
"11094",158,"not an old married man.—But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston. You","Emma"
"11095",158,"will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your","Emma"
"11096",158,"command—but my dancing days are over.”","Emma"
"11097",158,"","Emma"
"11098",158,"Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and","Emma"
"11099",158,"mortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr. Elton!","Emma"
"11100",158,"the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.—She looked round for a moment;","Emma"
"11101",158,"he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging","Emma"
"11102",158,"himself for settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed","Emma"
"11103",158,"between him and his wife.","Emma"
"11104",158,"","Emma"
"11105",158,"She would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her","Emma"
"11106",158,"face might be as hot.","Emma"
"11107",158,"","Emma"
"11108",158,"In another moment a happier sight caught her;—Mr. Knightley leading","Emma"
"11109",158,"Harriet to the set!—Never had she been more surprized, seldom more","Emma"
"11110",158,"delighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude,","Emma"
"11111",158,"both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and though","Emma"
"11112",158,"too distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she could","Emma"
"11113",158,"catch his eye again.","Emma"
"11114",158,"","Emma"
"11115",158,"His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good;","Emma"
"11116",158,"and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for","Emma"
"11117",158,"the cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment","Emma"
"11118",158,"and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features","Emma"
"11119",158,"announced. It was not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than ever,","Emma"
"11120",158,"flew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.","Emma"
"11121",158,"","Emma"
"11122",158,"Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very","Emma"
"11123",158,"foolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though","Emma"
"11124",158,"growing very like her;—_she_ spoke some of her feelings, by observing","Emma"
"11125",158,"audibly to her partner,","Emma"
"11126",158,"","Emma"
"11127",158,"“Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!—Very good-natured,","Emma"
"11128",158,"I declare.”","Emma"
"11129",158,"","Emma"
"11130",158,"Supper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard","Emma"
"11131",158,"from that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table","Emma"
"11132",158,"and taking up her spoon.","Emma"
"11133",158,"","Emma"
"11134",158,"“Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?—Here is your tippet. Mrs.","Emma"
"11135",158,"Weston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid there","Emma"
"11136",158,"will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done—One","Emma"
"11137",158,"door nailed up—Quantities of matting—My dear Jane, indeed you must. Mr.","Emma"
"11138",158,"Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!—so","Emma"
"11139",158,"gratified! Excellent dancing indeed!—Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I","Emma"
"11140",158,"said I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody","Emma"
"11141",158,"missed me.—I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.","Emma"
"11142",158,"Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a","Emma"
"11143",158,"vast deal of chat, and backgammon.—Tea was made downstairs, biscuits","Emma"
"11144",158,"and baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some of","Emma"
"11145",158,"her throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were","Emma"
"11146",158,"amused, and who were your partners. ‘Oh!’ said I, ‘I shall not","Emma"
"11147",158,"forestall Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love","Emma"
"11148",158,"to tell you all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr.","Emma"
"11149",158,"Elton, I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.’","Emma"
"11150",158,"My dear sir, you are too obliging.—Is there nobody you would not","Emma"
"11151",158,"rather?—I am not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane","Emma"
"11152",158,"on one arm, and me on the other!—Stop, stop, let us stand a little","Emma"
"11153",158,"back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she","Emma"
"11154",158,"looks!—Beautiful lace!—Now we all follow in her train. Quite the queen","Emma"
"11155",158,"of the evening!—Well, here we are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take","Emma"
"11156",158,"care of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded","Emma"
"11157",158,"there were two. How very odd! I was convinced there were two, and there","Emma"
"11158",158,"is but one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and","Emma"
"11159",158,"style—Candles everywhere.—I was telling you of your grandmama,","Emma"
"11160",158,"Jane,—There was a little disappointment.—The baked apples and biscuits,","Emma"
"11161",158,"excellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of","Emma"
"11162",158,"sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr.","Emma"
"11163",158,"Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all","Emma"
"11164",158,"out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread","Emma"
"11165",158,"and asparagus—so she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would","Emma"
"11166",158,"not speak of it to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss","Emma"
"11167",158,"Woodhouse, who would be so very much concerned!—Well, this is","Emma"
"11168",158,"brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!—Such","Emma"
"11169",158,"elegance and profusion!—I have seen nothing like it since—Well, where","Emma"
"11170",158,"shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere, so that Jane is not in a","Emma"
"11171",158,"draught. Where _I_ sit is of no consequence. Oh! do you recommend this","Emma"
"11172",158,"side?—Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill—only it seems too good—but just as","Emma"
"11173",158,"you please. What you direct in this house cannot be wrong. Dear Jane,","Emma"
"11174",158,"how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama? Soup too!","Emma"
"11175",158,"Bless me! I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent,","Emma"
"11176",158,"and I cannot help beginning.”","Emma"
"11177",158,"","Emma"
"11178",158,"Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper;","Emma"
"11179",158,"but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited him","Emma"
"11180",158,"irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. He was warm in his","Emma"
"11181",158,"reprobation of Mr. Elton’s conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness;","Emma"
"11182",158,"and Mrs. Elton’s looks also received the due share of censure.","Emma"
"11183",158,"","Emma"
"11184",158,"“They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,” said he. “Emma, why is it","Emma"
"11185",158,"that they are your enemies?”","Emma"
"11186",158,"","Emma"
"11187",158,"He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added,","Emma"
"11188",158,"“_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may","Emma"
"11189",158,"be.—To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma,","Emma"
"11190",158,"that you did want him to marry Harriet.”","Emma"
"11191",158,"","Emma"
"11192",158,"“I did,” replied Emma, “and they cannot forgive me.”","Emma"
"11193",158,"","Emma"
"11194",158,"He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he","Emma"
"11195",158,"only said,","Emma"
"11196",158,"","Emma"
"11197",158,"“I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections.”","Emma"
"11198",158,"","Emma"
"11199",158,"“Can you trust me with such flatterers?—Does my vain spirit ever tell","Emma"
"11200",158,"me I am wrong?”","Emma"
"11201",158,"","Emma"
"11202",158,"“Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.—If one leads you wrong,","Emma"
"11203",158,"I am sure the other tells you of it.”","Emma"
"11204",158,"","Emma"
"11205",158,"“I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There","Emma"
"11206",158,"is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not:","Emma"
"11207",158,"and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. It was","Emma"
"11208",158,"through a series of strange blunders!”","Emma"
"11209",158,"","Emma"
"11210",158,"“And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the","Emma"
"11211",158,"justice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has","Emma"
"11212",158,"chosen for himself.—Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which","Emma"
"11213",158,"Mrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless","Emma"
"11214",158,"girl—infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a","Emma"
"11215",158,"woman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.”","Emma"
"11216",158,"","Emma"
"11217",158,"Emma was extremely gratified.—They were interrupted by the bustle of","Emma"
"11218",158,"Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.","Emma"
"11219",158,"","Emma"
"11220",158,"“Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all","Emma"
"11221",158,"doing?—Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy!","Emma"
"11222",158,"Every body is asleep!”","Emma"
"11223",158,"","Emma"
"11224",158,"“I am ready,” said Emma, “whenever I am wanted.”","Emma"
"11225",158,"","Emma"
"11226",158,"“Whom are you going to dance with?” asked Mr. Knightley.","Emma"
"11227",158,"","Emma"
"11228",158,"She hesitated a moment, and then replied, “With you, if you will ask","Emma"
"11229",158,"me.”","Emma"
"11230",158,"","Emma"
"11231",158,"“Will you?” said he, offering his hand.","Emma"
"11232",158,"","Emma"
"11233",158,"“Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are","Emma"
"11234",158,"not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.”","Emma"
"11235",158,"","Emma"
"11236",158,"“Brother and sister! no, indeed.”","Emma"

"11241",158,"CHAPTER III","Emma"
"11242",158,"","Emma"
"11243",158,"","Emma"
"11244",158,"This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable","Emma"
"11245",158,"pleasure. It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which","Emma"
"11246",158,"she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.—She was extremely","Emma"
"11247",158,"glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the","Emma"
"11248",158,"Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much","Emma"
"11249",158,"alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was","Emma"
"11250",158,"peculiarly gratifying. The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few","Emma"
"11251",158,"minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the","Emma"
"11252",158,"occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward","Emma"
"11253",158,"to another happy result—the cure of Harriet’s infatuation.—From","Emma"
"11254",158,"Harriet’s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted","Emma"
"11255",158,"the ballroom, she had strong hopes. It seemed as if her eyes were","Emma"
"11256",158,"suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the","Emma"
"11257",158,"superior creature she had believed him. The fever was over, and Emma","Emma"
"11258",158,"could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by","Emma"
"11259",158,"injurious courtesy. She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for","Emma"
"11260",158,"supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther","Emma"
"11261",158,"requisite.—Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and","Emma"
"11262",158,"Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer","Emma"
"11263",158,"must be before her!","Emma"
"11264",158,"","Emma"
"11265",158,"She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He had told her that","Emma"
"11266",158,"he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he","Emma"
"11267",158,"was to be at home by the middle of the day. She did not regret it.","Emma"
"11268",158,"","Emma"
"11269",158,"Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them","Emma"
"11270",158,"all to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened","Emma"
"11271",158,"up for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their","Emma"
"11272",158,"grandpapa, when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons","Emma"
"11273",158,"entered whom she had never less expected to see together—Frank","Emma"
"11274",158,"Churchill, with Harriet leaning on his arm—actually Harriet!—A moment","Emma"
"11275",158,"sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened.","Emma"
"11276",158,"Harriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer","Emma"
"11277",158,"her.—The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards","Emma"
"11278",158,"asunder;—they were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately","Emma"
"11279",158,"sinking into a chair fainted away.","Emma"
"11280",158,"","Emma"
"11281",158,"A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,","Emma"
"11282",158,"and surprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but the","Emma"
"11283",158,"suspense of them cannot last long. A few minutes made Emma acquainted","Emma"
"11284",158,"with the whole.","Emma"
"11285",158,"","Emma"
"11286",158,"Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs.","Emma"
"11287",158,"Goddard’s, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and","Emma"
"11288",158,"taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough","Emma"
"11289",158,"for safety, had led them into alarm.—About half a mile beyond Highbury,","Emma"
"11290",158,"making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became","Emma"
"11291",158,"for a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies had","Emma"
"11292",158,"advanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small","Emma"
"11293",158,"distance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a","Emma"
"11294",158,"party of gipsies. A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and","Emma"
"11295",158,"Miss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and","Emma"
"11296",158,"calling on Harriet to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight","Emma"
"11297",158,"hedge at the top, and made the best of her way by a short cut back to","Emma"
"11298",158,"Highbury. But poor Harriet could not follow. She had suffered very much","Emma"
"11299",158,"from cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank","Emma"
"11300",158,"brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless—and in","Emma"
"11301",158,"this state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged to remain.","Emma"
"11302",158,"","Emma"
"11303",158,"How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more","Emma"
"11304",158,"courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could","Emma"
"11305",158,"not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen","Emma"
"11306",158,"children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and","Emma"
"11307",158,"impertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.—More and more","Emma"
"11308",158,"frightened, she immediately promised them money, and taking out her","Emma"
"11309",158,"purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more, or to","Emma"
"11310",158,"use her ill.—She was then able to walk, though but slowly, and was","Emma"
"11311",158,"moving away—but her terror and her purse were too tempting, and she was","Emma"
"11312",158,"followed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.","Emma"
"11313",158,"","Emma"
"11314",158,"In this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling and","Emma"
"11315",158,"conditioning, they loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance his","Emma"
"11316",158,"leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance","Emma"
"11317",158,"at this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning had induced","Emma"
"11318",158,"him to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road,","Emma"
"11319",158,"a mile or two beyond Highbury—and happening to have borrowed a pair of","Emma"
"11320",158,"scissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to","Emma"
"11321",158,"restore them, he had been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a","Emma"
"11322",158,"few minutes: he was therefore later than he had intended; and being on","Emma"
"11323",158,"foot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. The","Emma"
"11324",158,"terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then","Emma"
"11325",158,"their own portion. He had left them completely frightened; and Harriet","Emma"
"11326",158,"eagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength","Emma"
"11327",158,"enough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits were quite overcome. It","Emma"
"11328",158,"was his idea to bring her to Hartfield: he had thought of no other","Emma"
"11329",158,"place.","Emma"
"11330",158,"","Emma"
"11331",158,"This was the amount of the whole story,—of his communication and of","Emma"
"11332",158,"Harriet’s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.—He dared","Emma"
"11333",158,"not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays left him not","Emma"
"11334",158,"another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her","Emma"
"11335",158,"safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people","Emma"
"11336",158,"in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he set off, with all the","Emma"
"11337",158,"grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself.","Emma"
"11338",158,"","Emma"
"11339",158,"Such an adventure as this,—a fine young man and a lovely young woman","Emma"
"11340",158,"thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain","Emma"
"11341",158,"ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So Emma thought, at","Emma"
"11342",158,"least. Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician","Emma"
"11343",158,"have seen what she did, have witnessed their appearance together, and","Emma"
"11344",158,"heard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been","Emma"
"11345",158,"at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?—How much","Emma"
"11346",158,"more must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation and","Emma"
"11347",158,"foresight!—especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her","Emma"
"11348",158,"mind had already made.","Emma"
"11349",158,"","Emma"
"11350",158,"It was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had ever","Emma"
"11351",158,"occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory; no","Emma"
"11352",158,"rencontre, no alarm of the kind;—and now it had happened to the very","Emma"
"11353",158,"person, and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancing","Emma"
"11354",158,"to pass by to rescue her!—It certainly was very extraordinary!—And","Emma"
"11355",158,"knowing, as she did, the favourable state of mind of each at this","Emma"
"11356",158,"period, it struck her the more. He was wishing to get the better of his","Emma"
"11357",158,"attachment to herself, she just recovering from her mania for Mr.","Emma"
"11358",158,"Elton. It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most","Emma"
"11359",158,"interesting consequences. It was not possible that the occurrence","Emma"
"11360",158,"should not be strongly recommending each to the other.","Emma"
"11361",158,"","Emma"
"11362",158,"In the few minutes’ conversation which she had yet had with him, while","Emma"
"11363",158,"Harriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror, her","Emma"
"11364",158,"naïveté, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a","Emma"
"11365",158,"sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet’s own","Emma"
"11366",158,"account had been given, he had expressed his indignation at the","Emma"
"11367",158,"abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms. Every thing","Emma"
"11368",158,"was to take its natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted.","Emma"
"11369",158,"She would not stir a step, nor drop a hint. No, she had had enough of","Emma"
"11370",158,"interference. There could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive","Emma"
"11371",158,"scheme. It was no more than a wish. Beyond it she would on no account","Emma"
"11372",158,"proceed.","Emma"
"11373",158,"","Emma"
"11374",158,"Emma’s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of","Emma"
"11375",158,"what had passed,—aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but","Emma"
"11376",158,"she soon felt that concealment must be impossible. Within half an hour","Emma"
"11377",158,"it was known all over Highbury. It was the very event to engage those","Emma"
"11378",158,"who talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in","Emma"
"11379",158,"the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news. The last","Emma"
"11380",158,"night’s ball seemed lost in the gipsies. Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as","Emma"
"11381",158,"he sat, and, as Emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without","Emma"
"11382",158,"their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again. It was some","Emma"
"11383",158,"comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse","Emma"
"11384",158,"(for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well","Emma"
"11385",158,"as Miss Smith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had","Emma"
"11386",158,"the pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very","Emma"
"11387",158,"indifferent—which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,","Emma"
"11388",158,"and Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with. She had","Emma"
"11389",158,"an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man, for","Emma"
"11390",158,"she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not invent","Emma"
"11391",158,"illnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message.","Emma"
"11392",158,"","Emma"
"11393",158,"The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took","Emma"
"11394",158,"themselves off in a hurry. The young ladies of Highbury might have","Emma"
"11395",158,"walked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole history","Emma"
"11396",158,"dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her","Emma"
"11397",158,"nephews:—in her imagination it maintained its ground, and Henry and","Emma"
"11398",158,"John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the","Emma"
"11399",158,"gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the","Emma"
"11400",158,"slightest particular from the original recital.","Emma"

"11407",158,"","Emma"
"11408",158,"A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one","Emma"
"11409",158,"morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down","Emma"
"11410",158,"and hesitating, thus began:","Emma"
"11411",158,"","Emma"
"11412",158,"“Miss Woodhouse—if you are at leisure—I have something that I should","Emma"
"11413",158,"like to tell you—a sort of confession to make—and then, you know, it","Emma"
"11414",158,"will be over.”","Emma"
"11415",158,"","Emma"
"11416",158,"Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There was a","Emma"
"11417",158,"seriousness in Harriet’s manner which prepared her, quite as much as","Emma"
"11418",158,"her words, for something more than ordinary.","Emma"
"11419",158,"","Emma"
"11420",158,"“It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,” she continued, “to have","Emma"
"11421",158,"no reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered","Emma"
"11422",158,"creature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you should have the","Emma"
"11423",158,"satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is","Emma"
"11424",158,"necessary—I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and","Emma"
"11425",158,"I dare say you understand me.”","Emma"
"11426",158,"","Emma"
"11427",158,"“Yes,” said Emma, “I hope I do.”","Emma"
"11428",158,"","Emma"
"11429",158,"“How I could so long a time be fancying myself!...” cried Harriet,","Emma"
"11430",158,"warmly. “It seems like madness! I can see nothing at all extraordinary","Emma"
"11431",158,"in him now.—I do not care whether I meet him or not—except that of the","Emma"
"11432",158,"two I had rather not see him—and indeed I would go any distance round","Emma"
"11433",158,"to avoid him—but I do not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire","Emma"
"11434",158,"her nor envy her, as I have done: she is very charming, I dare say, and","Emma"
"11435",158,"all that, but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable—I shall","Emma"
"11436",158,"never forget her look the other night!—However, I assure you, Miss","Emma"
"11437",158,"Woodhouse, I wish her no evil.—No, let them be ever so happy together,","Emma"
"11438",158,"it will not give me another moment’s pang: and to convince you that I","Emma"
"11439",158,"have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy—what I ought to","Emma"
"11440",158,"have destroyed long ago—what I ought never to have kept—I know that","Emma"
"11441",158,"very well (blushing as she spoke).—However, now I will destroy it","Emma"
"11442",158,"all—and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that you","Emma"
"11443",158,"may see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what this parcel","Emma"
"11444",158,"holds?” said she, with a conscious look.","Emma"
"11445",158,"","Emma"
"11446",158,"“Not the least in the world.—Did he ever give you any thing?”","Emma"
"11447",158,"","Emma"
"11448",158,"“No—I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued","Emma"
"11449",158,"very much.”","Emma"
"11450",158,"","Emma"
"11451",158,"She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_","Emma"
"11452",158,"_precious_ _treasures_ on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited.","Emma"
"11453",158,"Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience. Within","Emma"
"11454",158,"abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which","Emma"
"11455",158,"Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but,","Emma"
"11456",158,"excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.","Emma"
"11457",158,"","Emma"
"11458",158,"“Now,” said Harriet, “you _must_ recollect.”","Emma"
"11459",158,"","Emma"
"11460",158,"“No, indeed I do not.”","Emma"
"11461",158,"","Emma"
"11462",158,"“Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what","Emma"
"11463",158,"passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last","Emma"
"11464",158,"times we ever met in it!—It was but a very few days before I had my","Emma"
"11465",158,"sore throat—just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came—I think the","Emma"
"11466",158,"very evening.—Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new","Emma"
"11467",158,"penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?—But, as you had none","Emma"
"11468",158,"about you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I took","Emma"
"11469",158,"mine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he","Emma"
"11470",158,"cut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before","Emma"
"11471",158,"he gave it back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help","Emma"
"11472",158,"making a treasure of it—so I put it by never to be used, and looked at","Emma"
"11473",158,"it now and then as a great treat.”","Emma"
"11474",158,"","Emma"
"11475",158,"“My dearest Harriet!” cried Emma, putting her hand before her face, and","Emma"
"11476",158,"jumping up, “you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.","Emma"
"11477",158,"Remember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this","Emma"
"11478",158,"relic—I knew nothing of that till this moment—but the cutting the","Emma"
"11479",158,"finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none about","Emma"
"11480",158,"me!—Oh! my sins, my sins!—And I had plenty all the while in my","Emma"
"11481",158,"pocket!—One of my senseless tricks!—I deserve to be under a continual","Emma"
"11482",158,"blush all the rest of my life.—Well—(sitting down again)—go on—what","Emma"
"11483",158,"else?”","Emma"
"11484",158,"","Emma"
"11485",158,"“And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected","Emma"
"11486",158,"it, you did it so naturally.”","Emma"
"11487",158,"","Emma"
"11488",158,"“And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!”","Emma"
"11489",158,"said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided","Emma"
"11490",158,"between wonder and amusement. And secretly she added to herself, “Lord","Emma"
"11491",158,"bless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a","Emma"
"11492",158,"piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! I","Emma"
"11493",158,"never was equal to this.”","Emma"
"11494",158,"","Emma"
"11495",158,"“Here,” resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, “here is something","Emma"
"11496",158,"still more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable, because","Emma"
"11497",158,"this is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister","Emma"
"11498",158,"never did.”","Emma"
"11499",158,"","Emma"
"11500",158,"Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of","Emma"
"11501",158,"an old pencil,—the part without any lead.","Emma"
"11502",158,"","Emma"
"11503",158,"“This was really his,” said Harriet.—“Do not you remember one","Emma"
"11504",158,"morning?—no, I dare say you do not. But one morning—I forget exactly","Emma"
"11505",158,"the day—but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _that_","Emma"
"11506",158,"_evening_, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; it was","Emma"
"11507",158,"about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about","Emma"
"11508",158,"brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took out","Emma"
"11509",158,"his pencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away, and","Emma"
"11510",158,"it would not do, so you lent him another, and this was left upon the","Emma"
"11511",158,"table as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I","Emma"
"11512",158,"dared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment.”","Emma"
"11513",158,"","Emma"
"11514",158,"“I do remember it,” cried Emma; “I perfectly remember it.—Talking about","Emma"
"11515",158,"spruce-beer.—Oh! yes—Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it, and","Emma"
"11516",158,"Mr. Elton’s seeming resolved to learn to like it too. I perfectly","Emma"
"11517",158,"remember it.—Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, was not he? I","Emma"
"11518",158,"have an idea he was standing just here.”","Emma"
"11519",158,"","Emma"
"11520",158,"“Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.—It is very odd, but I cannot","Emma"
"11521",158,"recollect.—Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I","Emma"
"11522",158,"am now.”—","Emma"
"11523",158,"","Emma"
"11524",158,"“Well, go on.”","Emma"
"11525",158,"","Emma"
"11526",158,"“Oh! that’s all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say—except that","Emma"
"11527",158,"I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to","Emma"
"11528",158,"see me do it.”","Emma"
"11529",158,"","Emma"
"11530",158,"“My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in","Emma"
"11531",158,"treasuring up these things?”","Emma"
"11532",158,"","Emma"
"11533",158,"“Yes, simpleton as I was!—but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I","Emma"
"11534",158,"could forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you","Emma"
"11535",158,"know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was—but","Emma"
"11536",158,"had not resolution enough to part with them.”","Emma"
"11537",158,"","Emma"
"11538",158,"“But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?—I have not a","Emma"
"11539",158,"word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be","Emma"
"11540",158,"useful.”","Emma"
"11541",158,"","Emma"
"11542",158,"“I shall be happier to burn it,” replied Harriet. “It has a","Emma"
"11543",158,"disagreeable look to me. I must get rid of every thing.—There it goes,","Emma"
"11544",158,"and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.”","Emma"
"11545",158,"","Emma"
"11546",158,"“And when,” thought Emma, “will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?”","Emma"
"11547",158,"","Emma"
"11548",158,"She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was","Emma"
"11549",158,"already made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had","Emma"
"11550",158,"_told_ no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet’s.—About a","Emma"
"11551",158,"fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and","Emma"
"11552",158,"quite undesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which","Emma"
"11553",158,"made the information she received more valuable. She merely said, in","Emma"
"11554",158,"the course of some trivial chat, “Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I","Emma"
"11555",158,"would advise you to do so and so”—and thought no more of it, till after","Emma"
"11556",158,"a minute’s silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, “I","Emma"
"11557",158,"shall never marry.”","Emma"
"11558",158,"","Emma"
"11559",158,"Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a","Emma"
"11560",158,"moment’s debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not,","Emma"
"11561",158,"replied,","Emma"
"11562",158,"","Emma"
"11563",158,"“Never marry!—This is a new resolution.”","Emma"
"11564",158,"","Emma"
"11565",158,"“It is one that I shall never change, however.”","Emma"
"11566",158,"","Emma"
"11567",158,"After another short hesitation, “I hope it does not proceed from—I hope","Emma"
"11568",158,"it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?”","Emma"
"11569",158,"","Emma"
"11570",158,"“Mr. Elton indeed!” cried Harriet indignantly.—“Oh! no”—and Emma could","Emma"
"11571",158,"just catch the words, “so superior to Mr. Elton!”","Emma"
"11572",158,"","Emma"
"11573",158,"She then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed no","Emma"
"11574",158,"farther?—should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?—Perhaps","Emma"
"11575",158,"Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps if she","Emma"
"11576",158,"were totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her to","Emma"
"11577",158,"hear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had","Emma"
"11578",158,"been, such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she","Emma"
"11579",158,"was perfectly resolved.—She believed it would be wiser for her to say","Emma"
"11580",158,"and know at once, all that she meant to say and know. Plain dealing was","Emma"
"11581",158,"always best. She had previously determined how far she would proceed,","Emma"
"11582",158,"on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have","Emma"
"11583",158,"the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.—She was","Emma"
"11584",158,"decided, and thus spoke—","Emma"
"11585",158,"","Emma"
"11586",158,"“Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your","Emma"
"11587",158,"resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from","Emma"
"11588",158,"an idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly","Emma"
"11589",158,"your superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?”","Emma"
"11590",158,"","Emma"
"11591",158,"“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose—","Emma"
"11592",158,"Indeed I am not so mad.—But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a","Emma"
"11593",158,"distance—and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of","Emma"
"11594",158,"the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so","Emma"
"11595",158,"proper, in me especially.”","Emma"
"11596",158,"","Emma"
"11597",158,"“I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you","Emma"
"11598",158,"was enough to warm your heart.”","Emma"
"11599",158,"","Emma"
"11600",158,"“Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!—The very","Emma"
"11601",158,"recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time—when I saw him","Emma"
"11602",158,"coming—his noble look—and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In one","Emma"
"11603",158,"moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!”","Emma"
"11604",158,"","Emma"
"11605",158,"“It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.—Yes,","Emma"
"11606",158,"honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.—But that it","Emma"
"11607",158,"will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do not","Emma"
"11608",158,"advise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage for","Emma"
"11609",158,"its being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will be","Emma"
"11610",158,"wisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do not","Emma"
"11611",158,"let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you. Be","Emma"
"11612",158,"observant of him. Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations. I","Emma"
"11613",158,"give you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again on","Emma"
"11614",158,"the subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward I","Emma"
"11615",158,"know nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We were","Emma"
"11616",158,"very wrong before; we will be cautious now.—He is your superior, no","Emma"
"11617",158,"doubt, and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious","Emma"
"11618",158,"nature; but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there","Emma"
"11619",158,"have been matches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I","Emma"
"11620",158,"would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured","Emma"
"11621",158,"your raising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste which I","Emma"
"11622",158,"shall always know how to value.”","Emma"
"11623",158,"","Emma"
"11624",158,"Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma was","Emma"
"11625",158,"very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her","Emma"
"11626",158,"friend. Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind—and it must","Emma"
"11627",158,"be saving her from the danger of degradation.","Emma"

"11632",158,"CHAPTER V","Emma"
"11633",158,"","Emma"
"11634",158,"","Emma"
"11635",158,"In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon","Emma"
"11636",158,"Hartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. The","Emma"
"11637",158,"Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use","Emma"
"11638",158,"to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her","Emma"
"11639",158,"grandmother’s; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was","Emma"
"11640",158,"again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was","Emma"
"11641",158,"likely to remain there full two months longer, provided at least she","Emma"
"11642",158,"were able to defeat Mrs. Elton’s activity in her service, and save","Emma"
"11643",158,"herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her","Emma"
"11644",158,"will.","Emma"
"11645",158,"","Emma"
"11646",158,"Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had","Emma"
"11647",158,"certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing","Emma"
"11648",158,"to dislike him more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing in","Emma"
"11649",158,"his pursuit of Emma. That Emma was his object appeared indisputable.","Emma"
"11650",158,"Every thing declared it; his own attentions, his father’s hints, his","Emma"
"11651",158,"mother-in-law’s guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct,","Emma"
"11652",158,"discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story. But while so many","Emma"
"11653",158,"were devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet,","Emma"
"11654",158,"Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with","Emma"
"11655",158,"Jane Fairfax. He could not understand it; but there were symptoms of","Emma"
"11656",158,"intelligence between them—he thought so at least—symptoms of admiration","Emma"
"11657",158,"on his side, which, having once observed, he could not persuade himself","Emma"
"11658",158,"to think entirely void of meaning, however he might wish to escape any","Emma"
"11659",158,"of Emma’s errors of imagination. _She_ was not present when the","Emma"
"11660",158,"suspicion first arose. He was dining with the Randalls family, and","Emma"
"11661",158,"Jane, at the Eltons’; and he had seen a look, more than a single look,","Emma"
"11662",158,"at Miss Fairfax, which, from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed","Emma"
"11663",158,"somewhat out of place. When he was again in their company, he could not","Emma"
"11664",158,"help remembering what he had seen; nor could he avoid observations","Emma"
"11665",158,"which, unless it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight,","Emma"
"11666",158,"","Emma"
"11667",158,"“Myself creating what I saw,”","Emma"
"11668",158,"","Emma"
"11669",158,"","Emma"
"11670",158,"brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of","Emma"
"11671",158,"private liking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill","Emma"
"11672",158,"and Jane.","Emma"
"11673",158,"","Emma"
"11674",158,"He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend","Emma"
"11675",158,"his evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he","Emma"
"11676",158,"joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who,","Emma"
"11677",158,"like themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the","Emma"
"11678",158,"weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates","Emma"
"11679",158,"and her niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, on","Emma"
"11680",158,"reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of","Emma"
"11681",158,"visiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in","Emma"
"11682",158,"and drink tea with him. The Randalls party agreed to it immediately;","Emma"
"11683",158,"and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons","Emma"
"11684",158,"listened to, she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse’s","Emma"
"11685",158,"most obliging invitation.","Emma"
"11686",158,"","Emma"
"11687",158,"As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on","Emma"
"11688",158,"horseback. The gentlemen spoke of his horse.","Emma"
"11689",158,"","Emma"
"11690",158,"“By the bye,” said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, “what","Emma"
"11691",158,"became of Mr. Perry’s plan of setting up his carriage?”","Emma"
"11692",158,"","Emma"
"11693",158,"Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, “I did not know that he ever","Emma"
"11694",158,"had any such plan.”","Emma"
"11695",158,"","Emma"
"11696",158,"“Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago.”","Emma"
"11697",158,"","Emma"
"11698",158,"“Me! impossible!”","Emma"
"11699",158,"","Emma"
"11700",158,"“Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as what was","Emma"
"11701",158,"certainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was","Emma"
"11702",158,"extremely happy about it. It was owing to _her_ persuasion, as she","Emma"
"11703",158,"thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. You","Emma"
"11704",158,"must remember it now?”","Emma"
"11705",158,"","Emma"
"11706",158,"“Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.”","Emma"
"11707",158,"","Emma"
"11708",158,"“Never! really, never!—Bless me! how could it be?—Then I must have","Emma"
"11709",158,"dreamt it—but I was completely persuaded—Miss Smith, you walk as if you","Emma"
"11710",158,"were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home.”","Emma"
"11711",158,"","Emma"
"11712",158,"“What is this?—What is this?” cried Mr. Weston, “about Perry and a","Emma"
"11713",158,"carriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad he","Emma"
"11714",158,"can afford it. You had it from himself, had you?”","Emma"
"11715",158,"","Emma"
"11716",158,"“No, sir,” replied his son, laughing, “I seem to have had it from","Emma"
"11717",158,"nobody.—Very odd!—I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston’s having","Emma"
"11718",158,"mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with","Emma"
"11719",158,"all these particulars—but as she declares she never heard a syllable of","Emma"
"11720",158,"it before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer. I","Emma"
"11721",158,"dream of every body at Highbury when I am away—and when I have gone","Emma"
"11722",158,"through my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs.","Emma"
"11723",158,"Perry.”","Emma"
"11724",158,"","Emma"
"11725",158,"“It is odd though,” observed his father, “that you should have had such","Emma"
"11726",158,"a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you","Emma"
"11727",158,"should be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry’s setting up his carriage! and","Emma"

"11729",158,"will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little","Emma"
"11730",158,"premature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!","Emma"
"11731",158,"And at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your","Emma"
"11732",158,"dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are","Emma"
"11733",158,"absent. Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?”","Emma"
"11734",158,"","Emma"
"11735",158,"Emma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to","Emma"
"11736",158,"prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of","Emma"
"11737",158,"Mr. Weston’s hint.","Emma"
"11738",158,"","Emma"
"11739",158,"“Why, to own the truth,” cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain","Emma"
"11740",158,"to be heard the last two minutes, “if I must speak on this subject,","Emma"
"11741",158,"there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have—I do not mean","Emma"
"11742",158,"to say that he did not dream it—I am sure I have sometimes the oddest","Emma"
"11743",158,"dreams in the world—but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge","Emma"
"11744",158,"that there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself","Emma"
"11745",158,"mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as","Emma"
"11746",158,"ourselves—but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only","Emma"
"11747",158,"thought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should","Emma"
"11748",158,"have a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning","Emma"
"11749",158,"because she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don’t you remember","Emma"
"11750",158,"grandmama’s telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we had","Emma"
"11751",158,"been walking to—very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to","Emma"
"11752",158,"Randalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother—indeed I","Emma"
"11753",158,"do not know who is not—and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;","Emma"
"11754",158,"she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go","Emma"
"11755",158,"beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that","Emma"
"11756",158,"I know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having","Emma"
"11757",158,"never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing","Emma"
"11758",158,"before I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and","Emma"
"11759",158,"now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not","Emma"
"11760",158,"like Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the","Emma"
"11761",158,"least thing in the world. Where is she?—Oh! just behind. Perfectly","Emma"
"11762",158,"remember Mrs. Perry’s coming.—Extraordinary dream, indeed!”","Emma"
"11763",158,"","Emma"
"11764",158,"They were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley’s eyes had preceded Miss","Emma"
"11765",158,"Bates’s in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill’s face, where he","Emma"
"11766",158,"thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had","Emma"
"11767",158,"involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy","Emma"
"11768",158,"with her shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen","Emma"
"11769",158,"waited at the door to let her pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank","Emma"
"11770",158,"Churchill the determination of catching her eye—he seemed watching her","Emma"
"11771",158,"intently—in vain, however, if it were so—Jane passed between them into","Emma"
"11772",158,"the hall, and looked at neither.","Emma"
"11773",158,"","Emma"
"11774",158,"There was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream must be","Emma"
"11775",158,"borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round","Emma"
"11776",158,"the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield,","Emma"
"11777",158,"and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and","Emma"
"11778",158,"persuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on","Emma"
"11779",158,"which two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Tea","Emma"
"11780",158,"passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.","Emma"
"11781",158,"","Emma"
"11782",158,"“Miss Woodhouse,” said Frank Churchill, after examining a table behind","Emma"
"11783",158,"him, which he could reach as he sat, “have your nephews taken away","Emma"
"11784",158,"their alphabets—their box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is","Emma"
"11785",158,"it? This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated","Emma"
"11786",158,"rather as winter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters","Emma"
"11787",158,"one morning. I want to puzzle you again.”","Emma"
"11788",158,"","Emma"
"11789",158,"Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was","Emma"
"11790",158,"quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much","Emma"
"11791",158,"disposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming words","Emma"
"11792",158,"for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. The","Emma"
"11793",158,"quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse,","Emma"
"11794",158,"who had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr.","Emma"
"11795",158,"Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in","Emma"
"11796",158,"lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the “poor","Emma"
"11797",158,"little boys,” or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter","Emma"
"11798",158,"near him, how beautifully Emma had written it.","Emma"
"11799",158,"","Emma"
"11800",158,"Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slight","Emma"
"11801",158,"glance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next to","Emma"
"11802",158,"Emma, Jane opposite to them—and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them","Emma"
"11803",158,"all; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little","Emma"
"11804",158,"apparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smile","Emma"
"11805",158,"pushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and","Emma"
"11806",158,"buried from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of","Emma"
"11807",158,"looking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after","Emma"
"11808",158,"every fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell","Emma"
"11809",158,"to work. She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help.","Emma"
"11810",158,"The word was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there","Emma"
"11811",158,"was a blush on Jane’s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise","Emma"
"11812",158,"ostensible. Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could","Emma"
"11813",158,"all be, was beyond his comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion","Emma"
"11814",158,"of his favourite could have been so lain asleep! He feared there must","Emma"
"11815",158,"be some decided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed","Emma"
"11816",158,"to meet him at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle for","Emma"
"11817",158,"gallantry and trick. It was a child’s play, chosen to conceal a deeper","Emma"
"11818",158,"game on Frank Churchill’s part.","Emma"
"11819",158,"","Emma"
"11820",158,"With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great alarm","Emma"
"11821",158,"and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. He saw a","Emma"
"11822",158,"short word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly and","Emma"
"11823",158,"demure. He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly","Emma"
"11824",158,"entertaining, though it was something which she judged it proper to","Emma"
"11825",158,"appear to censure; for she said, “Nonsense! for shame!” He heard Frank","Emma"
"11826",158,"Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane, “I will give it to","Emma"
"11827",158,"her—shall I?”—and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing","Emma"
"11828",158,"warmth. “No, no, you must not; you shall not, indeed.”","Emma"
"11829",158,"","Emma"
"11830",158,"It was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without","Emma"
"11831",158,"feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed","Emma"
"11832",158,"over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate","Emma"
"11833",158,"civility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley’s excessive curiosity","Emma"
"11834",158,"to know what this word might be, made him seize every possible moment","Emma"
"11835",158,"for darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it to","Emma"
"11836",158,"be _Dixon_. Jane Fairfax’s perception seemed to accompany his; her","Emma"
"11837",158,"comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning, the","Emma"
"11838",158,"superior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She was","Emma"
"11839",158,"evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed","Emma"
"11840",158,"more deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, “I did not","Emma"
"11841",158,"know that proper names were allowed,” pushed away the letters with even","Emma"
"11842",158,"an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word","Emma"
"11843",158,"that could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had made the","Emma"
"11844",158,"attack, and turned towards her aunt.","Emma"
"11845",158,"","Emma"
"11846",158,"“Aye, very true, my dear,” cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken","Emma"
"11847",158,"a word—“I was just going to say the same thing. It is time for us to be","Emma"
"11848",158,"going indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking","Emma"
"11849",158,"for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good","Emma"
"11850",158,"night.”","Emma"
"11851",158,"","Emma"
"11852",158,"Jane’s alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had","Emma"
"11853",158,"preconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table;","Emma"
"11854",158,"but so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr.","Emma"
"11855",158,"Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed","Emma"
"11856",158,"towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. She was","Emma"
"11857",158,"afterwards looking for her shawl—Frank Churchill was looking also—it","Emma"
"11858",158,"was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted,","Emma"
"11859",158,"Mr. Knightley could not tell.","Emma"
"11860",158,"","Emma"
"11861",158,"He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full of what","Emma"
"11862",158,"he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his","Emma"
"11863",158,"observations, he must—yes, he certainly must, as a friend—an anxious","Emma"
"11864",158,"friend—give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could not see her","Emma"
"11865",158,"in a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. It was","Emma"
"11866",158,"his duty.","Emma"
"11867",158,"","Emma"
"11868",158,"“Pray, Emma,” said he, “may I ask in what lay the great amusement, the","Emma"
"11869",158,"poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw","Emma"
"11870",158,"the word, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining","Emma"
"11871",158,"to the one, and so very distressing to the other.”","Emma"
"11872",158,"","Emma"
"11873",158,"Emma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true","Emma"
"11874",158,"explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she","Emma"
"11875",158,"was really ashamed of having ever imparted them.","Emma"
"11876",158,"","Emma"
"11877",158,"“Oh!” she cried in evident embarrassment, “it all meant nothing; a mere","Emma"
"11878",158,"joke among ourselves.”","Emma"
"11879",158,"","Emma"
"11880",158,"“The joke,” he replied gravely, “seemed confined to you and Mr.","Emma"
"11881",158,"Churchill.”","Emma"
"11882",158,"","Emma"
"11883",158,"He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would rather","Emma"
"11884",158,"busy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little while in","Emma"
"11885",158,"doubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference—fruitless","Emma"
"11886",158,"interference. Emma’s confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed","Emma"
"11887",158,"to declare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak. He owed it to","Emma"
"11888",158,"her, to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome","Emma"
"11889",158,"interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather","Emma"
"11890",158,"than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.","Emma"
"11891",158,"","Emma"
"11892",158,"“My dear Emma,” said he at last, with earnest kindness, “do you think","Emma"
"11893",158,"you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the","Emma"
"11894",158,"gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?”","Emma"
"11895",158,"","Emma"
"11896",158,"“Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.—Why","Emma"
"11897",158,"do you make a doubt of it?”","Emma"
"11898",158,"","Emma"
"11899",158,"“Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or","Emma"
"11900",158,"that she admired him?”","Emma"
"11901",158,"","Emma"
"11902",158,"“Never, never!” she cried with a most open eagerness—“Never, for the","Emma"
"11903",158,"twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And how could","Emma"
"11904",158,"it possibly come into your head?”","Emma"
"11905",158,"","Emma"
"11906",158,"“I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between","Emma"
"11907",158,"them—certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be","Emma"
"11908",158,"public.”","Emma"
"11909",158,"","Emma"
"11910",158,"“Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you can","Emma"
"11911",158,"vouchsafe to let your imagination wander—but it will not do—very sorry","Emma"
"11912",158,"to check you in your first essay—but indeed it will not do. There is no","Emma"
"11913",158,"admiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances which","Emma"
"11914",158,"have caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances—feelings","Emma"
"11915",158,"rather of a totally different nature—it is impossible exactly to","Emma"
"11916",158,"explain:—there is a good deal of nonsense in it—but the part which is","Emma"
"11917",158,"capable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are as far","Emma"
"11918",158,"from any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings in","Emma"
"11919",158,"the world can be. That is, I _presume_ it to be so on her side, and I","Emma"
"11920",158,"can _answer_ for its being so on his. I will answer for the gentleman’s","Emma"
"11921",158,"indifference.”","Emma"
"11922",158,"","Emma"
"11923",158,"She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction which","Emma"
"11924",158,"silenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would have","Emma"
"11925",158,"prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his","Emma"
"11926",158,"suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a","Emma"
"11927",158,"circumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meet","Emma"
"11928",158,"hers. He found he could not be useful, and his feelings were too much","Emma"
"11929",158,"irritated for talking. That he might not be irritated into an absolute","Emma"
"11930",158,"fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse’s tender habits required almost","Emma"
"11931",158,"every evening throughout the year, he soon afterwards took a hasty","Emma"

"11937",158,"CHAPTER VI","Emma"
"11938",158,"","Emma"
"11939",158,"","Emma"
"11940",158,"After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs.","Emma"
"11941",158,"Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification","Emma"
"11942",158,"of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No such","Emma"
"11943",158,"importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at","Emma"
"11944",158,"present. In the daily interchange of news, they must be again","Emma"
"11945",158,"restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings’","Emma"
"11946",158,"coming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill,","Emma"
"11947",158,"whose health seemed every day to supply a different report, and the","Emma"
"11948",158,"situation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might","Emma"
"11949",158,"eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child, as that of","Emma"
"11950",158,"all her neighbours was by the approach of it.","Emma"
"11951",158,"","Emma"
"11952",158,"Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal","Emma"
"11953",158,"of pleasure and parade. Her introductions and recommendations must all","Emma"
"11954",158,"wait, and every projected party be still only talked of. So she thought","Emma"
"11955",158,"at first;—but a little consideration convinced her that every thing","Emma"
"11956",158,"need not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the","Emma"
"11957",158,"Sucklings did not come? They could go there again with them in the","Emma"
"11958",158,"autumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. That there was","Emma"
"11959",158,"to be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the","Emma"
"11960",158,"idea of another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see","Emma"
"11961",158,"what every body found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had","Emma"
"11962",158,"agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two or three more","Emma"
"11963",158,"of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be","Emma"
"11964",158,"done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the","Emma"
"11965",158,"bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic","Emma"
"11966",158,"parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.","Emma"
"11967",158,"","Emma"
"11968",158,"This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but","Emma"
"11969",158,"feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr.","Emma"
"11970",158,"Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother and","Emma"
"11971",158,"sister had failed her, that the two parties should unite, and go","Emma"
"11972",158,"together; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it","Emma"
"11973",158,"was to be, if she had no objection. Now, as her objection was nothing","Emma"
"11974",158,"but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must","Emma"
"11975",158,"already be perfectly aware, it was not worth bringing forward again:—it","Emma"
"11976",158,"could not be done without a reproof to him, which would be giving pain","Emma"
"11977",158,"to his wife; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an","Emma"
"11978",158,"arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid; an","Emma"
"11979",158,"arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of","Emma"
"11980",158,"being said to be of Mrs. Elton’s party! Every feeling was offended; and","Emma"
"11981",158,"the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of","Emma"
"11982",158,"secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr.","Emma"
"11983",158,"Weston’s temper.","Emma"
"11984",158,"","Emma"
"11985",158,"“I am glad you approve of what I have done,” said he very comfortably.","Emma"
"11986",158,"“But I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing without","Emma"
"11987",158,"numbers. One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its","Emma"
"11988",158,"own amusement. And she is a good-natured woman after all. One could not","Emma"
"11989",158,"leave her out.”","Emma"
"11990",158,"","Emma"
"11991",158,"Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.","Emma"
"11992",158,"","Emma"
"11993",158,"It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton was","Emma"
"11994",158,"growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to","Emma"
"11995",158,"pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing","Emma"
"11996",158,"into sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days,","Emma"
"11997",158,"before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured","Emma"
"11998",158,"on, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton’s resources were","Emma"
"11999",158,"inadequate to such an attack.","Emma"
"12000",158,"","Emma"
"12001",158,"“Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?” she cried.—“And such weather","Emma"
"12002",158,"for exploring!—These delays and disappointments are quite odious. What","Emma"
"12003",158,"are we to do?—The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing done.","Emma"
"12004",158,"Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful","Emma"
"12005",158,"exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.”","Emma"
"12006",158,"","Emma"
"12007",158,"“You had better explore to Donwell,” replied Mr. Knightley. “That may","Emma"
"12008",158,"be done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are","Emma"
"12009",158,"ripening fast.”","Emma"
"12010",158,"","Emma"
"12011",158,"If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,","Emma"
"12012",158,"for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the “Oh! I should like","Emma"
"12013",158,"it of all things,” was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell was","Emma"
"12014",158,"famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation:","Emma"
"12015",158,"but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt","Emma"
"12016",158,"the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. She promised him again","Emma"
"12017",158,"and again to come—much oftener than he doubted—and was extremely","Emma"
"12018",158,"gratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment","Emma"
"12019",158,"as she chose to consider it.","Emma"
"12020",158,"","Emma"
"12021",158,"“You may depend upon me,” said she. “I certainly will come. Name your","Emma"
"12022",158,"day, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?”","Emma"
"12023",158,"","Emma"
"12024",158,"“I cannot name a day,” said he, “till I have spoken to some others whom","Emma"
"12025",158,"I would wish to meet you.”","Emma"
"12026",158,"","Emma"
"12027",158,"“Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.—I am Lady","Emma"
"12028",158,"Patroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me.”","Emma"
"12029",158,"","Emma"
"12030",158,"“I hope you will bring Elton,” said he: “but I will not trouble you to","Emma"
"12031",158,"give any other invitations.”","Emma"
"12032",158,"","Emma"
"12033",158,"“Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider—you need not be afraid","Emma"
"12034",158,"of delegating power to _me_. I am no young lady on her preferment.","Emma"
"12035",158,"Married women, you know, may be safely authorised. It is my party.","Emma"
"12036",158,"Leave it all to me. I will invite your guests.”","Emma"
"12037",158,"","Emma"
"12038",158,"“No,”—he calmly replied,—“there is but one married woman in the world","Emma"
"12039",158,"whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell, and","Emma"
"12040",158,"that one is—”","Emma"
"12041",158,"","Emma"
"12042",158,"“—Mrs. Weston, I suppose,” interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.","Emma"
"12043",158,"","Emma"
"12044",158,"“No—Mrs. Knightley;—and till she is in being, I will manage such","Emma"
"12045",158,"matters myself.”","Emma"
"12046",158,"","Emma"
"12047",158,"“Ah! you are an odd creature!” she cried, satisfied to have no one","Emma"
"12048",158,"preferred to herself.—“You are a humourist, and may say what you like.","Emma"
"12049",158,"Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me—Jane and her","Emma"
"12050",158,"aunt.—The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting","Emma"
"12051",158,"the Hartfield family. Don’t scruple. I know you are attached to them.”","Emma"
"12052",158,"","Emma"
"12053",158,"“You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on","Emma"
"12054",158,"Miss Bates in my way home.”","Emma"
"12055",158,"","Emma"
"12056",158,"“That’s quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:—but as you like. It is","Emma"
"12057",158,"to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. I","Emma"
"12058",158,"shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging","Emma"
"12059",158,"on my arm. Here,—probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be","Emma"
"12060",158,"more simple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to be","Emma"
"12061",158,"no form or parade—a sort of gipsy party. We are to walk about your","Emma"
"12062",158,"gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under","Emma"
"12063",158,"trees;—and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all out","Emma"
"12064",158,"of doors—a table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing as natural","Emma"
"12065",158,"and simple as possible. Is not that your idea?”","Emma"
"12066",158,"","Emma"
"12067",158,"“Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the","Emma"
"12068",158,"table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of","Emma"
"12069",158,"gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is","Emma"
"12070",158,"best observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating","Emma"
"12071",158,"strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.”","Emma"
"12072",158,"","Emma"
"12073",158,"“Well—as you please; only don’t have a great set out. And, by the bye,","Emma"
"12074",158,"can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?—Pray be","Emma"
"12075",158,"sincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to","Emma"
"12076",158,"inspect anything—”","Emma"
"12077",158,"","Emma"
"12078",158,"“I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.”","Emma"
"12079",158,"","Emma"
"12080",158,"“Well—but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely","Emma"
"12081",158,"clever.”","Emma"
"12082",158,"","Emma"
"12083",158,"“I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and","Emma"
"12084",158,"would spurn any body’s assistance.”","Emma"
"12085",158,"","Emma"
"12086",158,"“I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on","Emma"
"12087",158,"donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me—and my caro sposo walking by. I","Emma"
"12088",158,"really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life I","Emma"
"12089",158,"conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever so","Emma"
"12090",158,"many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up at","Emma"
"12091",158,"home;—and very long walks, you know—in summer there is dust, and in","Emma"
"12092",158,"winter there is dirt.”","Emma"
"12093",158,"","Emma"
"12094",158,"“You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane","Emma"
"12095",158,"is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however,","Emma"
"12096",158,"if you prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole’s. I would wish every thing","Emma"
"12097",158,"to be as much to your taste as possible.”","Emma"
"12098",158,"","Emma"
"12099",158,"“That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.","Emma"
"12100",158,"Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the","Emma"
"12101",158,"warmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.—Yes,","Emma"
"12102",158,"believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in","Emma"
"12103",158,"the whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the very thing to please","Emma"
"12104",158,"me.”","Emma"
"12105",158,"","Emma"
"12106",158,"Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. He","Emma"
"12107",158,"wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;","Emma"
"12108",158,"and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat","Emma"
"12109",158,"would inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the","Emma"
"12110",158,"specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at","Emma"
"12111",158,"Donwell, be tempted away to his misery.","Emma"
"12112",158,"","Emma"
"12113",158,"He was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him","Emma"
"12114",158,"for his easy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at Donwell for","Emma"
"12115",158,"two years. “Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could go","Emma"
"12116",158,"very well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear","Emma"
"12117",158,"girls walked about the gardens. He did not suppose they could be damp","Emma"
"12118",158,"now, in the middle of the day. He should like to see the old house","Emma"
"12119",158,"again exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton,","Emma"
"12120",158,"and any other of his neighbours.—He could not see any objection at all","Emma"
"12121",158,"to his, and Emma’s, and Harriet’s going there some very fine morning.","Emma"
"12122",158,"He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them—very kind","Emma"
"12123",158,"and sensible—much cleverer than dining out.—He was not fond of dining","Emma"
"12124",158,"out.”","Emma"
"12125",158,"","Emma"
"12126",158,"Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body’s most ready concurrence. The","Emma"
"12127",158,"invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like","Emma"
"12128",158,"Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment","Emma"
"12129",158,"to themselves.—Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of","Emma"
"12130",158,"pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over","Emma"
"12131",158,"to join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which","Emma"
"12132",158,"could have been dispensed with.—Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say","Emma"
"12133",158,"that he should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no","Emma"
"12134",158,"time in writing, and spare no arguments to induce him to come.","Emma"
"12135",158,"","Emma"
"12136",158,"In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to","Emma"
"12137",158,"Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was","Emma"
"12138",158,"settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,—the weather appearing","Emma"
"12139",158,"exactly right.","Emma"
"12140",158,"","Emma"
"12141",158,"Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was","Emma"
"12142",158,"safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of","Emma"
"12143",158,"this al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the","Emma"
"12144",158,"Abbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was","Emma"
"12145",158,"happily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what","Emma"
"12146",158,"had been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not","Emma"
"12147",158,"to heat themselves.—Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on","Emma"
"12148",158,"purpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when all","Emma"
"12149",158,"the others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and","Emma"
"12150",158,"sympathiser.","Emma"
"12151",158,"","Emma"
"12152",158,"It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she","Emma"
"12153",158,"was satisfied of her father’s comfort, she was glad to leave him, and","Emma"
"12154",158,"look around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more","Emma"
"12155",158,"particular observation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds","Emma"
"12156",158,"which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family.","Emma"
"12157",158,"","Emma"
"12158",158,"She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with","Emma"
"12159",158,"the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she viewed","Emma"
"12160",158,"the respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming,","Emma"
"12161",158,"characteristic situation, low and sheltered—its ample gardens","Emma"
"12162",158,"stretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with","Emma"
"12163",158,"all the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight—and its abundance","Emma"
"12164",158,"of timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagance","Emma"
"12165",158,"had rooted up.—The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike","Emma"
"12166",158,"it, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many","Emma"
"12167",158,"comfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.—It was just what it ought","Emma"
"12168",158,"to be, and it looked what it was—and Emma felt an increasing respect","Emma"
"12169",158,"for it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted","Emma"
"12170",158,"in blood and understanding.—Some faults of temper John Knightley had;","Emma"
"12171",158,"but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably. She had given them","Emma"
"12172",158,"neither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. These","Emma"
"12173",158,"were pleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it","Emma"
"12174",158,"was necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the","Emma"
"12175",158,"strawberry-beds.—The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank","Emma"
"12176",158,"Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton,","Emma"
"12177",158,"in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket, was","Emma"
"12178",158,"very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or","Emma"
"12179",158,"talking—strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or","Emma"
"12180",158,"spoken of.—“The best fruit in England—every body’s favourite—always","Emma"
"12181",158,"wholesome.—These the finest beds and finest sorts.—Delightful to gather","Emma"
"12182",158,"for one’s self—the only way of really enjoying them.—Morning decidedly","Emma"
"12183",158,"the best time—never tired—every sort good—hautboy infinitely","Emma"
"12184",158,"superior—no comparison—the others hardly eatable—hautboys very","Emma"
"12185",158,"scarce—Chili preferred—white wood finest flavour of all—price of","Emma"
"12186",158,"strawberries in London—abundance about Bristol—Maple","Emma"
"12187",158,"Grove—cultivation—beds when to be renewed—gardeners thinking exactly","Emma"
"12188",158,"different—no general rule—gardeners never to be put out of their","Emma"
"12189",158,"way—delicious fruit—only too rich to be eaten much of—inferior to","Emma"
"12190",158,"cherries—currants more refreshing—only objection to gathering","Emma"
"12191",158,"strawberries the stooping—glaring sun—tired to death—could bear it no","Emma"
"12192",158,"longer—must go and sit in the shade.”","Emma"
"12193",158,"","Emma"
"12194",158,"Such, for half an hour, was the conversation—interrupted only once by","Emma"
"12195",158,"Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to","Emma"
"12196",158,"inquire if he were come—and she was a little uneasy.—She had some fears","Emma"
"12197",158,"of his horse.","Emma"
"12198",158,"","Emma"
"12199",158,"Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged to","Emma"
"12200",158,"overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.—A situation,","Emma"
"12201",158,"a most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton had received","Emma"
"12202",158,"notice of it that morning, and was in raptures. It was not with Mrs.","Emma"
"12203",158,"Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity and splendour it","Emma"
"12204",158,"fell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an","Emma"
"12205",158,"acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove. Delightful,","Emma"
"12206",158,"charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every","Emma"
"12207",158,"thing—and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with","Emma"
"12208",158,"immediately.—On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph—and she","Emma"
"12209",158,"positively refused to take her friend’s negative, though Miss Fairfax","Emma"
"12210",158,"continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any","Emma"
"12211",158,"thing, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge","Emma"
"12212",158,"before.—Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an","Emma"
"12213",158,"acquiescence by the morrow’s post.—How Jane could bear it at all, was","Emma"
"12214",158,"astonishing to Emma.—She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly—and at","Emma"
"12215",158,"last, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a","Emma"
"12216",158,"removal.—“Should not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the","Emma"
"12217",158,"gardens—all the gardens?—She wished to see the whole extent.”—The","Emma"
"12218",158,"pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear.","Emma"
"12219",158,"","Emma"
"12220",158,"It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a","Emma"
"12221",158,"scattered, dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly","Emma"
"12222",158,"followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of","Emma"
"12223",158,"limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the","Emma"
"12224",158,"river, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.—It led to nothing;","Emma"
"12225",158,"nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars,","Emma"
"12226",158,"which seemed intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an","Emma"
"12227",158,"approach to the house, which never had been there. Disputable, however,","Emma"
"12228",158,"as might be the taste of such a termination, it was in itself a","Emma"
"12229",158,"charming walk, and the view which closed it extremely pretty.—The","Emma"
"12230",158,"considerable slope, at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood,","Emma"
"12231",158,"gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half a","Emma"
"12232",158,"mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well","Emma"
"12233",158,"clothed with wood;—and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed","Emma"
"12234",158,"and sheltered, rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the","Emma"
"12235",158,"river making a close and handsome curve around it.","Emma"
"12236",158,"","Emma"
"12237",158,"It was a sweet view—sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,","Emma"
"12238",158,"English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without","Emma"
"12239",158,"being oppressive.","Emma"
"12240",158,"","Emma"
"12241",158,"In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and","Emma"
"12242",158,"towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet","Emma"
"12243",158,"distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley and","Emma"
"12244",158,"Harriet!—It was an odd tête-à-tête; but she was glad to see it.—There","Emma"
"12245",158,"had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, and","Emma"
"12246",158,"turned from her with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasant","Emma"
"12247",158,"conversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have been","Emma"
"12248",158,"sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm;","Emma"
"12249",158,"but now she feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all its","Emma"
"12250",158,"appendages of prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading","Emma"
"12251",158,"flocks, orchard in blossom, and light column of smoke ascending.—She","Emma"
"12252",158,"joined them at the wall, and found them more engaged in talking than in","Emma"
"12253",158,"looking around. He was giving Harriet information as to modes of","Emma"
"12254",158,"agriculture, etc. and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, “These","Emma"
"12255",158,"are my own concerns. I have a right to talk on such subjects, without","Emma"
"12256",158,"being suspected of introducing Robert Martin.”—She did not suspect him.","Emma"
"12257",158,"It was too old a story.—Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of","Emma"
"12258",158,"Harriet.—They took a few turns together along the walk.—The shade was","Emma"
"12259",158,"most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.","Emma"
"12260",158,"","Emma"
"12261",158,"The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;—and they","Emma"
"12262",158,"were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come. Mrs.","Emma"
"12263",158,"Weston looked, and looked in vain. His father would not own himself","Emma"
"12264",158,"uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishing","Emma"
"12265",158,"that he would part with his black mare. He had expressed himself as to","Emma"
"12266",158,"coming, with more than common certainty. “His aunt was so much better,","Emma"
"12267",158,"that he had not a doubt of getting over to them.”—Mrs. Churchill’s","Emma"
"12268",158,"state, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to such","Emma"
"12269",158,"sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable","Emma"
"12270",158,"dependence—and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say,","Emma"
"12271",158,"that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented","Emma"
"12272",158,"coming.—Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration;","Emma"
"12273",158,"she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.","Emma"
"12274",158,"","Emma"
"12275",158,"The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see","Emma"
"12276",158,"what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as","Emma"
"12277",158,"far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at","Emma"
"12278",158,"any rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.—Mr.","Emma"
"12279",158,"Woodhouse, who had already taken his little round in the highest part","Emma"
"12280",158,"of the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by","Emma"
"12281",158,"him, stirred no more; and his daughter resolved to remain with him,","Emma"
"12282",158,"that Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise","Emma"
"12283",158,"and variety which her spirits seemed to need.","Emma"
"12284",158,"","Emma"
"12285",158,"Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse’s","Emma"
"12286",158,"entertainment. Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals,","Emma"
"12287",158,"shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had been","Emma"
"12288",158,"prepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and the","Emma"
"12289",158,"kindness had perfectly answered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly","Emma"
"12290",158,"well amused. Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now he","Emma"
"12291",158,"would shew them all to Emma;—fortunate in having no other resemblance","Emma"
"12292",158,"to a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw, for he was","Emma"
"12293",158,"slow, constant, and methodical.—Before this second looking over was","Emma"
"12294",158,"begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few","Emma"
"12295",158,"moments’ free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of the","Emma"
"12296",158,"house—and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly","Emma"
"12297",158,"in from the garden, and with a look of escape.—Little expecting to meet","Emma"
"12298",158,"Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse","Emma"
"12299",158,"was the very person she was in quest of.","Emma"
"12300",158,"","Emma"
"12301",158,"“Will you be so kind,” said she, “when I am missed, as to say that I am","Emma"
"12302",158,"gone home?—I am going this moment.—My aunt is not aware how late it is,","Emma"
"12303",158,"nor how long we have been absent—but I am sure we shall be wanted, and","Emma"
"12304",158,"I am determined to go directly.—I have said nothing about it to any","Emma"
"12305",158,"body. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some are gone to","Emma"
"12306",158,"the ponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in I shall not","Emma"
"12307",158,"be missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I","Emma"
"12308",158,"am gone?”","Emma"
"12309",158,"","Emma"
"12310",158,"“Certainly, if you wish it;—but you are not going to walk to Highbury","Emma"
"12311",158,"alone?”","Emma"
"12312",158,"","Emma"
"12313",158,"“Yes—what should hurt me?—I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty","Emma"
"12314",158,"minutes.”","Emma"
"12315",158,"","Emma"
"12316",158,"“But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let my","Emma"
"12317",158,"father’s servant go with you.—Let me order the carriage. It can be","Emma"
"12318",158,"round in five minutes.”","Emma"
"12319",158,"","Emma"
"12320",158,"“Thank you, thank you—but on no account.—I would rather walk.—And for","Emma"
"12321",158,"_me_ to be afraid of walking alone!—I, who may so soon have to guard","Emma"
"12322",158,"others!”","Emma"
"12323",158,"","Emma"
"12324",158,"She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, “That","Emma"
"12325",158,"can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order the","Emma"
"12326",158,"carriage. The heat even would be danger.—You are fatigued already.”","Emma"
"12327",158,"","Emma"
"12328",158,"“I am,”—she answered—“I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of","Emma"
"12329",158,"fatigue—quick walking will refresh me.—Miss Woodhouse, we all know at","Emma"
"12330",158,"times what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, are","Emma"
"12331",158,"exhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me","Emma"
"12332",158,"have my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.”","Emma"
"12333",158,"","Emma"
"12334",158,"Emma had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and entering into","Emma"
"12335",158,"her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, and watched","Emma"
"12336",158,"her safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her parting look was","Emma"
"12337",158,"grateful—and her parting words, “Oh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of","Emma"
"12338",158,"being sometimes alone!”—seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and","Emma"
"12339",158,"to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her,","Emma"
"12340",158,"even towards some of those who loved her best.","Emma"
"12341",158,"","Emma"
"12342",158,"“Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!” said Emma, as she turned back into","Emma"
"12343",158,"the hall again. “I do pity you. And the more sensibility you betray of","Emma"
"12344",158,"their just horrors, the more I shall like you.”","Emma"
"12345",158,"","Emma"
"12346",158,"Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only","Emma"
"12347",158,"accomplished some views of St. Mark’s Place, Venice, when Frank","Emma"
"12348",158,"Churchill entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him, she had","Emma"
"12349",158,"forgotten to think of him—but she was very glad to see him. Mrs. Weston","Emma"
"12350",158,"would be at ease. The black mare was blameless; _they_ were right who","Emma"
"12351",158,"had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. He had been detained by a","Emma"
"12352",158,"temporary increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure, which had","Emma"
"12353",158,"lasted some hours—and he had quite given up every thought of coming,","Emma"
"12354",158,"till very late;—and had he known how hot a ride he should have, and how","Emma"
"12355",158,"late, with all his hurry, he must be, he believed he should not have","Emma"
"12356",158,"come at all. The heat was excessive; he had never suffered any thing","Emma"
"12357",158,"like it—almost wished he had staid at home—nothing killed him like","Emma"
"12358",158,"heat—he could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat was","Emma"
"12359",158,"intolerable—and he sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the","Emma"
"12360",158,"slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse’s fire, looking very deplorable.","Emma"
"12361",158,"","Emma"
"12362",158,"“You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,” said Emma.","Emma"
"12363",158,"","Emma"
"12364",158,"“As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill be","Emma"
"12365",158,"spared—but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all be","Emma"
"12366",158,"going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met _one_ as I","Emma"
"12367",158,"came—Madness in such weather!—absolute madness!”","Emma"
"12368",158,"","Emma"
"12369",158,"Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill’s","Emma"
"12370",158,"state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of","Emma"
"12371",158,"humour. Some people were always cross when they were hot. Such might be","Emma"
"12372",158,"his constitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often","Emma"
"12373",158,"the cure of such incidental complaints, she recommended his taking some","Emma"
"12374",158,"refreshment; he would find abundance of every thing in the","Emma"
"12375",158,"dining-room—and she humanely pointed out the door.","Emma"
"12376",158,"","Emma"
"12377",158,"“No—he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would only make him","Emma"
"12378",158,"hotter.” In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; and","Emma"
"12379",158,"muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned all","Emma"
"12380",158,"her attention to her father, saying in secret—","Emma"
"12381",158,"","Emma"
"12382",158,"“I am glad I have done being in love with him. I should not like a man","Emma"
"12383",158,"who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet’s sweet easy","Emma"
"12384",158,"temper will not mind it.”","Emma"
"12385",158,"","Emma"
"12386",158,"He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came","Emma"
"12387",158,"back all the better—grown quite cool—and, with good manners, like","Emma"
"12388",158,"himself—able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in their","Emma"
"12389",158,"employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so late.","Emma"
"12390",158,"He was not in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and,","Emma"
"12391",158,"at last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably. They were looking","Emma"
"12392",158,"over views in Swisserland.","Emma"
"12393",158,"","Emma"
"12394",158,"“As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,” said he. “I shall","Emma"
"12395",158,"never be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my","Emma"
"12396",158,"sketches, some time or other, to look at—or my tour to read—or my poem.","Emma"
"12397",158,"I shall do something to expose myself.”","Emma"
"12398",158,"","Emma"
"12399",158,"“That may be—but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to","Emma"

"12402",158,"","Emma"
"12403",158,"“They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for","Emma"
"12404",158,"her. I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. I","Emma"
"12405",158,"assure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that I","Emma"
"12406",158,"shall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. I","Emma"
"12407",158,"want a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating","Emma"
"12408",158,"eyes may fancy—I am sick of England—and would leave it to-morrow, if I","Emma"
"12409",158,"could.”","Emma"
"12410",158,"","Emma"
"12411",158,"“You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few","Emma"

"12414",158,"“_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I do","Emma"
"12415",158,"not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwarted in","Emma"

"12419",158,"“You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and","Emma"
"12420",158,"eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice","Emma"
"12421",158,"of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you","Emma"
"12422",158,"nearly on a par with the rest of us.”","Emma"
"12423",158,"","Emma"
"12424",158,"“No—I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure.”","Emma"
"12425",158,"","Emma"
"12426",158,"“We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;—you will join us. It is not","Emma"
"12427",158,"Swisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want","Emma"
"12428",158,"of a change. You will stay, and go with us?”","Emma"
"12429",158,"","Emma"
"12430",158,"“No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.”","Emma"
"12431",158,"","Emma"

"12444",158,"The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.","Emma"
"12445",158,"With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; others","Emma"
"12446",158,"took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and","Emma"
"12447",158,"disturbance on Miss Fairfax’s disappearance being explained. That it","Emma"
"12448",158,"was time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with a short","Emma"
"12449",158,"final arrangement for the next day’s scheme, they parted. Frank","Emma"
"12450",158,"Churchill’s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much,","Emma"

"12454",158,"","Emma"

"12461",158,"CHAPTER VII","Emma"
"12462",158,"","Emma"
"12463",158,"","Emma"
"12464",158,"They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward","Emma"
"12465",158,"circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in","Emma"
"12466",158,"favour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating","Emma"
"12467",158,"safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good","Emma"
"12468",158,"time. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, with","Emma"
"12469",158,"the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr.","Emma"
"12470",158,"Woodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there.","Emma"
"12471",158,"Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body","Emma"
"12472",158,"had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount","Emma"
"12473",158,"of the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of","Emma"
"12474",158,"spirits, a want of union, which could not be got over. They separated","Emma"
"12475",158,"too much into parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took","Emma"
"12476",158,"charge of Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank","Emma"
"12477",158,"Churchill. And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise","Emma"
"12478",158,"better. It seemed at first an accidental division, but it never","Emma"
"12479",158,"materially varied. Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness","Emma"
"12480",158,"to mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole","Emma"
"12481",158,"hours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of","Emma"
"12482",158,"separation, between the other parties, too strong for any fine","Emma"
"12483",158,"prospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to","Emma"
"12484",158,"remove.","Emma"
"12485",158,"","Emma"
"12486",158,"At first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen Frank","Emma"
"12487",158,"Churchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing—looked","Emma"
"12488",158,"without seeing—admired without intelligence—listened without knowing","Emma"
"12489",158,"what she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet","Emma"
"12490",158,"should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.","Emma"
"12491",158,"","Emma"
"12492",158,"When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,","Emma"
"12493",158,"for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first","Emma"
"12494",158,"object. Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to","Emma"
"12495",158,"her. To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he","Emma"
"12496",158,"cared for—and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered,","Emma"
"12497",158,"was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the","Emma"
"12498",158,"admission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most","Emma"
"12499",158,"animating period of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own","Emma"
"12500",158,"estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most people","Emma"
"12501",158,"looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but","Emma"
"12502",158,"flirtation could very well describe. “Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss","Emma"
"12503",158,"Woodhouse flirted together excessively.” They were laying themselves","Emma"
"12504",158,"open to that very phrase—and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple","Emma"
"12505",158,"Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another. Not that Emma was gay and","Emma"
"12506",158,"thoughtless from any real felicity; it was rather because she felt less","Emma"
"12507",158,"happy than she had expected. She laughed because she was disappointed;","Emma"
"12508",158,"and though she liked him for his attentions, and thought them all,","Emma"
"12509",158,"whether in friendship, admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious,","Emma"
"12510",158,"they were not winning back her heart. She still intended him for her","Emma"
"12511",158,"friend.","Emma"
"12512",158,"","Emma"
"12513",158,"“How much I am obliged to you,” said he, “for telling me to come","Emma"
"12514",158,"to-day!—If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all","Emma"
"12515",158,"the happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again.”","Emma"
"12516",158,"","Emma"
"12517",158,"“Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that","Emma"
"12518",158,"you were too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than","Emma"
"12519",158,"you deserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded to","Emma"
"12520",158,"come.”","Emma"
"12521",158,"","Emma"
"12522",158,"“Don’t say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me.”","Emma"
"12523",158,"","Emma"
"12524",158,"“It is hotter to-day.”","Emma"
"12525",158,"","Emma"
"12526",158,"“Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.”","Emma"
"12527",158,"","Emma"
"12528",158,"“You are comfortable because you are under command.”","Emma"
"12529",158,"","Emma"
"12530",158,"“Your command?—Yes.”","Emma"
"12531",158,"","Emma"
"12532",158,"“Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,","Emma"
"12533",158,"somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own","Emma"
"12534",158,"management; but to-day you are got back again—and as I cannot be always","Emma"
"12535",158,"with you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command","Emma"
"12536",158,"rather than mine.”","Emma"
"12537",158,"","Emma"
"12538",158,"“It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without a","Emma"
"12539",158,"motive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be always","Emma"
"12540",158,"with me. You are always with me.”","Emma"
"12541",158,"","Emma"
"12542",158,"“Dating from three o’clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could not","Emma"
"12543",158,"begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour","Emma"
"12544",158,"before.”","Emma"
"12545",158,"","Emma"
"12546",158,"“Three o’clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen you","Emma"
"12547",158,"first in February.”","Emma"
"12548",158,"","Emma"
"12549",158,"“Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her voice)—nobody","Emma"
"12550",158,"speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talking","Emma"
"12551",158,"nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.”","Emma"
"12552",158,"","Emma"
"12553",158,"“I say nothing of which I am ashamed,” replied he, with lively","Emma"
"12554",158,"impudence. “I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill","Emma"
"12555",158,"hear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and","Emma"
"12556",158,"Dorking on the other. I saw you first in February.” And then","Emma"
"12557",158,"whispering—“Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do to","Emma"
"12558",158,"rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They _shall_ talk. Ladies and","Emma"
"12559",158,"gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is,","Emma"
"12560",158,"presides) to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking","Emma"
"12561",158,"of?”","Emma"
"12562",158,"","Emma"
"12563",158,"Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great","Emma"
"12564",158,"deal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse’s presiding; Mr.","Emma"
"12565",158,"Knightley’s answer was the most distinct.","Emma"
"12566",158,"","Emma"
"12567",158,"“Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all","Emma"
"12568",158,"thinking of?”","Emma"
"12569",158,"","Emma"
"12570",158,"“Oh! no, no”—cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could—“Upon no","Emma"
"12571",158,"account in the world. It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt","Emma"
"12572",158,"of just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all","Emma"
"12573",158,"thinking of. I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps,","Emma"
"12574",158,"(glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts I might not be","Emma"
"12575",158,"afraid of knowing.”","Emma"
"12576",158,"","Emma"
"12577",158,"“It is a sort of thing,” cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, “which _I_","Emma"
"12578",158,"should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though,","Emma"
"12579",158,"perhaps, as the _Chaperon_ of the party—_I_ never was in any","Emma"
"12580",158,"circle—exploring parties—young ladies—married women—”","Emma"
"12581",158,"","Emma"
"12582",158,"Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,","Emma"
"12583",158,"","Emma"
"12584",158,"“Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed—quite unheard of—but","Emma"
"12585",158,"some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Every body","Emma"
"12586",158,"knows what is due to _you_.”","Emma"
"12587",158,"","Emma"
"12588",158,"“It will not do,” whispered Frank to Emma; “they are most of them","Emma"
"12589",158,"affronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen—I","Emma"
"12590",158,"am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives her right of","Emma"
"12591",158,"knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requires","Emma"
"12592",158,"something very entertaining from each of you, in a general way. Here","Emma"
"12593",158,"are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased to say, am very","Emma"
"12594",158,"entertaining already,) and she only demands from each of you either one","Emma"
"12595",158,"thing very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated—or two","Emma"
"12596",158,"things moderately clever—or three things very dull indeed, and she","Emma"
"12597",158,"engages to laugh heartily at them all.”","Emma"
"12598",158,"","Emma"
"12599",158,"“Oh! very well,” exclaimed Miss Bates, “then I need not be uneasy.","Emma"
"12600",158,"‘Three things very dull indeed.’ That will just do for me, you know. I","Emma"
"12601",158,"shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth,","Emma"
"12602",158,"shan’t I? (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on","Emma"
"12603",158,"every body’s assent)—Do not you all think I shall?”","Emma"
"12604",158,"","Emma"
"12605",158,"Emma could not resist.","Emma"
"12606",158,"","Emma"
"12607",158,"“Ah! ma’am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me—but you will be","Emma"
"12608",158,"limited as to number—only three at once.”","Emma"
"12609",158,"","Emma"
"12610",158,"Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not","Emma"
"12611",158,"immediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could not","Emma"
"12612",158,"anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.","Emma"
"12613",158,"","Emma"
"12614",158,"“Ah!—well—to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, (turning to Mr.","Emma"
"12615",158,"Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself very","Emma"
"12616",158,"disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old","Emma"
"12617",158,"friend.”","Emma"
"12618",158,"","Emma"
"12619",158,"“I like your plan,” cried Mr. Weston. “Agreed, agreed. I will do my","Emma"
"12620",158,"best. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?”","Emma"
"12621",158,"","Emma"
"12622",158,"“Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,” answered his son;—“but we shall be","Emma"
"12623",158,"indulgent—especially to any one who leads the way.”","Emma"
"12624",158,"","Emma"
"12625",158,"“No, no,” said Emma, “it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr.","Emma"
"12626",158,"Weston’s shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let me","Emma"
"12627",158,"hear it.”","Emma"
"12628",158,"","Emma"
"12629",158,"“I doubt its being very clever myself,” said Mr. Weston. “It is too","Emma"
"12630",158,"much a matter of fact, but here it is.—What two letters of the alphabet","Emma"
"12631",158,"are there, that express perfection?”","Emma"
"12632",158,"","Emma"
"12633",158,"“What two letters!—express perfection! I am sure I do not know.”","Emma"
"12634",158,"","Emma"
"12635",158,"“Ah! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will never","Emma"
"12636",158,"guess.—I will tell you.—M. and A.—Em-ma.—Do you understand?”","Emma"
"12637",158,"","Emma"
"12638",158,"Understanding and gratification came together. It might be a very","Emma"
"12639",158,"indifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and","Emma"
"12640",158,"enjoy in it—and so did Frank and Harriet.—It did not seem to touch the","Emma"
"12641",158,"rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, and Mr.","Emma"
"12642",158,"Knightley gravely said,","Emma"
"12643",158,"","Emma"
"12644",158,"“This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston","Emma"
"12645",158,"has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every body","Emma"
"12646",158,"else. _Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon.”","Emma"
"12647",158,"","Emma"
"12648",158,"“Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,” said Mrs. Elton; “_I_","Emma"
"12649",158,"really cannot attempt—I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I had","Emma"
"12650",158,"an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at all","Emma"
"12651",158,"pleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!—You know","Emma"
"12652",158,"who I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things are very well","Emma"
"12653",158,"at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of","Emma"
"12654",158,"place, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in","Emma"
"12655",158,"summer. Miss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those who have","Emma"
"12656",158,"witty things at every body’s service. I do not pretend to be a wit. I","Emma"
"12657",158,"have a great deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must be","Emma"
"12658",158,"allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, if","Emma"
"12659",158,"you please, Mr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. We","Emma"
"12660",158,"have nothing clever to say—not one of us.","Emma"
"12661",158,"","Emma"
"12662",158,"“Yes, yes, pray pass _me_,” added her husband, with a sort of sneering","Emma"
"12663",158,"consciousness; “_I_ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss","Emma"
"12664",158,"Woodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married man—quite good for","Emma"
"12665",158,"nothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?”","Emma"
"12666",158,"","Emma"
"12667",158,"“With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot.","Emma"
"12668",158,"Come, Jane, take my other arm.”","Emma"
"12669",158,"","Emma"
"12670",158,"Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off. “Happy","Emma"
"12671",158,"couple!” said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of","Emma"
"12672",158,"hearing:—“How well they suit one another!—Very lucky—marrying as they","Emma"
"12673",158,"did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!—They only knew","Emma"
"12674",158,"each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!—for as to","Emma"
"12675",158,"any real knowledge of a person’s disposition that Bath, or any public","Emma"
"12676",158,"place, can give—it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. It is","Emma"
"12677",158,"only by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as","Emma"
"12678",158,"they always are, that you can form any just judgment. Short of that, it","Emma"
"12679",158,"is all guess and luck—and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man","Emma"
"12680",158,"has committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest","Emma"
"12681",158,"of his life!”","Emma"
"12682",158,"","Emma"
"12683",158,"Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own","Emma"
"12684",158,"confederates, spoke now.","Emma"
"12685",158,"","Emma"
"12686",158,"“Such things do occur, undoubtedly.”—She was stopped by a cough. Frank","Emma"
"12687",158,"Churchill turned towards her to listen.","Emma"
"12688",158,"","Emma"
"12689",158,"“You were speaking,” said he, gravely. She recovered her voice.","Emma"
"12690",158,"","Emma"
"12691",158,"“I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate","Emma"
"12692",158,"circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot","Emma"
"12693",158,"imagine them to be very frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment may","Emma"
"12694",158,"arise—but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards. I","Emma"
"12695",158,"would be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute","Emma"
"12696",158,"characters, (whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,)","Emma"
"12697",158,"who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience, an","Emma"

"12699",158,"","Emma"
"12700",158,"He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon","Emma"
"12701",158,"afterwards said, in a lively tone,","Emma"
"12702",158,"","Emma"
"12703",158,"“Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I","Emma"
"12704",158,"marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? (turning","Emma"
"12705",158,"to Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?—I am sure I should like any","Emma"
"12706",158,"body fixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, (with a","Emma"
"12707",158,"smile at his father). Find some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopt","Emma"
"12708",158,"her, educate her.”","Emma"
"12709",158,"","Emma"
"12710",158,"“And make her like myself.”","Emma"
"12711",158,"","Emma"
"12712",158,"“By all means, if you can.”","Emma"
"12713",158,"","Emma"
"12714",158,"“Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming","Emma"
"12715",158,"wife.”","Emma"
"12716",158,"","Emma"
"12717",158,"“She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else.","Emma"
"12718",158,"I shall go abroad for a couple of years—and when I return, I shall come","Emma"
"12719",158,"to you for my wife. Remember.”","Emma"
"12720",158,"","Emma"
"12721",158,"Emma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch every","Emma"
"12722",158,"favourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creature described?","Emma"
"12723",158,"Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished.","Emma"
"12724",158,"He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment; who could","Emma"
"12725",158,"say? Referring the education to her seemed to imply it.","Emma"
"12726",158,"","Emma"
"12727",158,"“Now, ma’am,” said Jane to her aunt, “shall we join Mrs. Elton?”","Emma"
"12728",158,"","Emma"
"12729",158,"“If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I was","Emma"
"12730",158,"ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We shall","Emma"
"12731",158,"soon overtake her. There she is—no, that’s somebody else. That’s one of","Emma"
"12732",158,"the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.—Well, I","Emma"
"12733",158,"declare—”","Emma"
"12734",158,"","Emma"
"12735",158,"They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr.","Emma"
"12736",158,"Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man’s","Emma"
"12737",158,"spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired at","Emma"
"12738",158,"last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking","Emma"
"12739",158,"quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and","Emma"
"12740",158,"quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views","Emma"
"12741",158,"beneath her. The appearance of the servants looking out for them to","Emma"
"12742",158,"give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of","Emma"
"12743",158,"collecting and preparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to","Emma"
"12744",158,"have _her_ carriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospect of the","Emma"
"12745",158,"quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of","Emma"
"12746",158,"this day of pleasure. Such another scheme, composed of so many","Emma"
"12747",158,"ill-assorted people, she hoped never to be betrayed into again.","Emma"
"12748",158,"","Emma"
"12749",158,"While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side. He","Emma"
"12750",158,"looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,","Emma"
"12751",158,"","Emma"
"12752",158,"“Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a","Emma"
"12753",158,"privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use","Emma"
"12754",158,"it. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could","Emma"
"12755",158,"you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your","Emma"
"12756",158,"wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?—Emma, I had not","Emma"
"12757",158,"thought it possible.”","Emma"
"12758",158,"","Emma"
"12759",158,"Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.","Emma"
"12760",158,"","Emma"
"12761",158,"“Nay, how could I help saying what I did?—Nobody could have helped it.","Emma"
"12762",158,"It was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me.”","Emma"
"12763",158,"","Emma"
"12764",158,"“I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked of it","Emma"
"12765",158,"since. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it—with what","Emma"
"12766",158,"candour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring your","Emma"
"12767",158,"forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was for","Emma"
"12768",158,"ever receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must be","Emma"
"12769",158,"so irksome.”","Emma"
"12770",158,"","Emma"
"12771",158,"“Oh!” cried Emma, “I know there is not a better creature in the world:","Emma"
"12772",158,"but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are most","Emma"
"12773",158,"unfortunately blended in her.”","Emma"
"12774",158,"","Emma"
"12775",158,"“They are blended,” said he, “I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,","Emma"
"12776",158,"I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over","Emma"
"12777",158,"the good. Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless","Emma"
"12778",158,"absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any","Emma"
"12779",158,"liberties of manner. Were she your equal in situation—but, Emma,","Emma"
"12780",158,"consider how far this is from being the case. She is poor; she has sunk","Emma"
"12781",158,"from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to old age, must","Emma"
"12782",158,"probably sink more. Her situation should secure your compassion. It was","Emma"
"12783",158,"badly done, indeed! You, whom she had known from an infant, whom she","Emma"
"12784",158,"had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour, to have","Emma"
"12785",158,"you now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at","Emma"
"12786",158,"her, humble her—and before her niece, too—and before others, many of","Emma"
"12787",158,"whom (certainly _some_,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment","Emma"
"12788",158,"of her.—This is not pleasant to you, Emma—and it is very far from","Emma"
"12789",158,"pleasant to me; but I must, I will,—I will tell you truths while I can;","Emma"
"12790",158,"satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and","Emma"
"12791",158,"trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than","Emma"
"12792",158,"you can do now.”","Emma"
"12793",158,"","Emma"
"12794",158,"While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was","Emma"
"12795",158,"ready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in. He had","Emma"
"12796",158,"misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted, and her","Emma"
"12797",158,"tongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against herself,","Emma"
"12798",158,"mortification, and deep concern. She had not been able to speak; and,","Emma"
"12799",158,"on entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome—then","Emma"
"12800",158,"reproaching herself for having taken no leave, making no","Emma"
"12801",158,"acknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness, she looked out with","Emma"
"12802",158,"voice and hand eager to shew a difference; but it was just too late. He","Emma"
"12803",158,"had turned away, and the horses were in motion. She continued to look","Emma"
"12804",158,"back, but in vain; and soon, with what appeared unusual speed, they","Emma"
"12805",158,"were half way down the hill, and every thing left far behind. She was","Emma"
"12806",158,"vexed beyond what could have been expressed—almost beyond what she","Emma"
"12807",158,"could conceal. Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at","Emma"
"12808",158,"any circumstance in her life. She was most forcibly struck. The truth","Emma"
"12809",158,"of this representation there was no denying. She felt it at her heart.","Emma"
"12810",158,"How could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates! How could","Emma"
"12811",158,"she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued! And","Emma"
"12812",158,"how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude, of","Emma"
"12813",158,"concurrence, of common kindness!","Emma"
"12814",158,"","Emma"
"12815",158,"Time did not compose her. As she reflected more, she seemed but to feel","Emma"
"12816",158,"it more. She never had been so depressed. Happily it was not necessary","Emma"
"12817",158,"to speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself,","Emma"
"12818",158,"fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tears running","Emma"
"12819",158,"down her cheeks almost all the way home, without being at any trouble","Emma"
"12820",158,"to check them, extraordinary as they were.","Emma"

"12825",158,"CHAPTER VIII","Emma"
"12826",158,"","Emma"
"12827",158,"","Emma"
"12828",158,"The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma’s thoughts all the","Emma"
"12829",158,"evening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, she could","Emma"
"12830",158,"not tell. They, in their different homes, and their different ways,","Emma"
"12831",158,"might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it was a","Emma"
"12832",158,"morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational","Emma"
"12833",158,"satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than","Emma"
"12834",158,"any she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her","Emma"
"12835",158,"father, was felicity to it. _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure, for","Emma"
"12836",158,"there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his","Emma"
"12837",158,"comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his fond","Emma"
"12838",158,"affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her general conduct,","Emma"
"12839",158,"be open to any severe reproach. As a daughter, she hoped she was not","Emma"
"12840",158,"without a heart. She hoped no one could have said to her, “How could","Emma"
"12841",158,"you be so unfeeling to your father?—I must, I will tell you truths","Emma"
"12842",158,"while I can.” Miss Bates should never again—no, never! If attention, in","Emma"
"12843",158,"future, could do away the past, she might hope to be forgiven. She had","Emma"
"12844",158,"been often remiss, her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in","Emma"
"12845",158,"thought than fact; scornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more.","Emma"
"12846",158,"In the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the very next","Emma"
"12847",158,"morning, and it should be the beginning, on her side, of a regular,","Emma"
"12848",158,"equal, kindly intercourse.","Emma"
"12849",158,"","Emma"
"12850",158,"She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, that","Emma"
"12851",158,"nothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought, that she","Emma"
"12852",158,"might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come in while","Emma"
"12853",158,"she were paying her visit. She had no objection. She would not be","Emma"
"12854",158,"ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers.","Emma"
"12855",158,"Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she saw him not.","Emma"
"12856",158,"","Emma"
"12857",158,"“The ladies were all at home.” She had never rejoiced at the sound","Emma"
"12858",158,"before, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,","Emma"
"12859",158,"with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or of","Emma"
"12860",158,"deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule.","Emma"
"12861",158,"","Emma"
"12862",158,"There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking.","Emma"
"12863",158,"She heard Miss Bates’s voice, something was to be done in a hurry; the","Emma"
"12864",158,"maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased to wait","Emma"
"12865",158,"a moment, and then ushered her in too soon. The aunt and niece seemed","Emma"
"12866",158,"both escaping into the adjoining room. Jane she had a distinct glimpse","Emma"
"12867",158,"of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out, she","Emma"
"12868",158,"heard Miss Bates saying, “Well, my dear, I shall _say_ you are laid","Emma"
"12869",158,"down upon the bed, and I am sure you are ill enough.”","Emma"
"12870",158,"","Emma"
"12871",158,"Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she did","Emma"
"12872",158,"not quite understand what was going on.","Emma"
"12873",158,"","Emma"
"12874",158,"“I am afraid Jane is not very well,” said she, “but I do not know; they","Emma"
"12875",158,"_tell_ me she is well. I dare say my daughter will be here presently,","Emma"
"12876",158,"Miss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty had not gone. I","Emma"
"12877",158,"am very little able—Have you a chair, ma’am? Do you sit where you like?","Emma"
"12878",158,"I am sure she will be here presently.”","Emma"
"12879",158,"","Emma"
"12880",158,"Emma seriously hoped she would. She had a moment’s fear of Miss Bates","Emma"
"12881",158,"keeping away from her. But Miss Bates soon came—“Very happy and","Emma"
"12882",158,"obliged”—but Emma’s conscience told her that there was not the same","Emma"
"12883",158,"cheerful volubility as before—less ease of look and manner. A very","Emma"
"12884",158,"friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to a","Emma"
"12885",158,"return of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.","Emma"
"12886",158,"","Emma"
"12887",158,"“Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!—I suppose you have heard—and are","Emma"
"12888",158,"come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in","Emma"
"12889",158,"me—(twinkling away a tear or two)—but it will be very trying for us to","Emma"
"12890",158,"part with her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadful","Emma"
"12891",158,"headache just now, writing all the morning:—such long letters, you","Emma"
"12892",158,"know, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon. ‘My dear,’","Emma"
"12893",158,"said I, ‘you will blind yourself’—for tears were in her eyes","Emma"
"12894",158,"perpetually. One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great","Emma"
"12895",158,"change; and though she is amazingly fortunate—such a situation, I","Emma"
"12896",158,"suppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first going out—do","Emma"
"12897",158,"not think us ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good","Emma"
"12898",158,"fortune—(again dispersing her tears)—but, poor dear soul! if you were","Emma"
"12899",158,"to see what a headache she has. When one is in great pain, you know one","Emma"
"12900",158,"cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low as","Emma"
"12901",158,"possible. To look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy","Emma"
"12902",158,"she is to have secured such a situation. You will excuse her not coming","Emma"
"12903",158,"to you—she is not able—she is gone into her own room—I want her to lie","Emma"
"12904",158,"down upon the bed. ‘My dear,’ said I, ‘I shall say you are laid down","Emma"
"12905",158,"upon the bed:’ but, however, she is not; she is walking about the room.","Emma"
"12906",158,"But, now that she has written her letters, she says she shall soon be","Emma"
"12907",158,"well. She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,","Emma"
"12908",158,"but your kindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting at the door—I","Emma"
"12909",158,"was quite ashamed—but somehow there was a little bustle—for it so","Emma"
"12910",158,"happened that we had not heard the knock, and till you were on the","Emma"
"12911",158,"stairs, we did not know any body was coming. ‘It is only Mrs. Cole,’","Emma"
"12912",158,"said I, ‘depend upon it. Nobody else would come so early.’ ‘Well,’ said","Emma"
"12913",158,"she, ‘it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.’","Emma"
"12914",158,"But then Patty came in, and said it was you. ‘Oh!’ said I, ‘it is Miss","Emma"
"12915",158,"Woodhouse: I am sure you will like to see her.’—‘I can see nobody,’","Emma"
"12916",158,"said she; and up she got, and would go away; and that was what made us","Emma"
"12917",158,"keep you waiting—and extremely sorry and ashamed we were. ‘If you must","Emma"
"12918",158,"go, my dear,’ said I, ‘you must, and I will say you are laid down upon","Emma"
"12919",158,"the bed.’”","Emma"
"12920",158,"","Emma"
"12921",158,"Emma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long growing","Emma"
"12922",158,"kinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted","Emma"
"12923",158,"as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing","Emma"
"12924",158,"but pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle","Emma"
"12925",158,"sensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very","Emma"
"12926",158,"naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, when","Emma"
"12927",158,"she might not bear to see herself. She spoke as she felt, with earnest","Emma"
"12928",158,"regret and solicitude—sincerely wishing that the circumstances which","Emma"
"12929",158,"she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, might","Emma"
"12930",158,"be as much for Miss Fairfax’s advantage and comfort as possible. “It","Emma"
"12931",158,"must be a severe trial to them all. She had understood it was to be","Emma"
"12932",158,"delayed till Colonel Campbell’s return.”","Emma"
"12933",158,"","Emma"
"12934",158,"“So very kind!” replied Miss Bates. “But you are always kind.”","Emma"
"12935",158,"","Emma"
"12936",158,"There was no bearing such an “always;” and to break through her","Emma"
"12937",158,"dreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of—","Emma"
"12938",158,"","Emma"
"12939",158,"“Where—may I ask?—is Miss Fairfax going?”","Emma"
"12940",158,"","Emma"
"12941",158,"“To a Mrs. Smallridge—charming woman—most superior—to have the charge","Emma"
"12942",158,"of her three little girls—delightful children. Impossible that any","Emma"
"12943",158,"situation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps,","Emma"
"12944",158,"Mrs. Suckling’s own family, and Mrs. Bragge’s; but Mrs. Smallridge is","Emma"
"12945",158,"intimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:—lives only four","Emma"
"12946",158,"miles from Maple Grove. Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove.”","Emma"
"12947",158,"","Emma"
"12948",158,"“Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes—”","Emma"
"12949",158,"","Emma"
"12950",158,"“Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. She","Emma"
"12951",158,"would not take a denial. She would not let Jane say, ‘No;’ for when","Emma"
"12952",158,"Jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very","Emma"
"12953",158,"morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite","Emma"
"12954",158,"decided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention;","Emma"
"12955",158,"exactly as you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing till","Emma"
"12956",158,"Colonel Campbell’s return, and nothing should induce her to enter into","Emma"
"12957",158,"any engagement at present—and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over","Emma"
"12958",158,"again—and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her","Emma"
"12959",158,"mind!—but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, saw","Emma"
"12960",158,"farther than I did. It is not every body that would have stood out in","Emma"
"12961",158,"such a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Jane’s answer; but she","Emma"
"12962",158,"positively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday, as","Emma"
"12963",158,"Jane wished her; she would wait—and, sure enough, yesterday evening it","Emma"
"12964",158,"was all settled that Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had not","Emma"
"12965",158,"the least idea!—Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that","Emma"
"12966",158,"upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge’s situation, she","Emma"
"12967",158,"had come to the resolution of accepting it.—I did not know a word of it","Emma"
"12968",158,"till it was all settled.”","Emma"
"12969",158,"","Emma"
"12970",158,"“You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?”","Emma"
"12971",158,"","Emma"
"12972",158,"“Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so, upon","Emma"
"12973",158,"the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. ‘You _must_","Emma"
"12974",158,"_all_ spend your evening with us,’ said she—‘I positively must have you","Emma"
"12975",158,"_all_ come.’”","Emma"
"12976",158,"","Emma"
"12977",158,"“Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?”","Emma"
"12978",158,"","Emma"
"12979",158,"“No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I","Emma"
"12980",158,"thought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let","Emma"
"12981",158,"him off, he did not;—but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there,","Emma"
"12982",158,"and a very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, Miss","Emma"
"12983",158,"Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed","Emma"
"12984",158,"rather fagged after the morning’s party. Even pleasure, you know, is","Emma"
"12985",158,"fatiguing—and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have","Emma"
"12986",158,"enjoyed it. However, _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party,","Emma"
"12987",158,"and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.”","Emma"
"12988",158,"","Emma"
"12989",158,"“Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been","Emma"
"12990",158,"making up her mind the whole day?”","Emma"
"12991",158,"","Emma"
"12992",158,"“I dare say she had.”","Emma"
"12993",158,"","Emma"
"12994",158,"“Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all her","Emma"
"12995",158,"friends—but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is","Emma"
"12996",158,"possible—I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.”","Emma"
"12997",158,"","Emma"
"12998",158,"“Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thing in","Emma"
"12999",158,"the world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings and","Emma"
"13000",158,"Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal","Emma"
"13001",158,"and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton’s acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most","Emma"
"13002",158,"delightful woman!—A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove—and as","Emma"
"13003",158,"to the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there","Emma"
"13004",158,"are not such elegant sweet children anywhere. Jane will be treated with","Emma"
"13005",158,"such regard and kindness!—It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of","Emma"
"13006",158,"pleasure.—And her salary!—I really cannot venture to name her salary to","Emma"
"13007",158,"you, Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used as you are to great sums, would","Emma"
"13008",158,"hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like","Emma"
"13009",158,"Jane.”","Emma"
"13010",158,"","Emma"
"13011",158,"“Ah! madam,” cried Emma, “if other children are at all like what I","Emma"
"13012",158,"remember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount of","Emma"
"13013",158,"what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly","Emma"
"13014",158,"earned.”","Emma"
"13015",158,"","Emma"
"13016",158,"“You are so noble in your ideas!”","Emma"

"13020",158,"“Very soon, very soon, indeed; that’s the worst of it. Within a","Emma"
"13021",158,"fortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does not","Emma"
"13022",158,"know how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her thoughts, and","Emma"
"13023",158,"say, Come ma’am, do not let us think about it any more.”","Emma"
"13024",158,"","Emma"
"13025",158,"“Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel and","Emma"
"13026",158,"Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before","Emma"
"13027",158,"their return?”","Emma"
"13028",158,"","Emma"
"13029",158,"“Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such a","Emma"
"13030",158,"situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was so","Emma"
"13031",158,"astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs.","Emma"
"13032",158,"Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me","Emma"
"13033",158,"upon it! It was before tea—stay—no, it could not be before tea, because","Emma"
"13034",158,"we were just going to cards—and yet it was before tea, because I","Emma"
"13035",158,"remember thinking—Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; something","Emma"
"13036",158,"happened before tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room","Emma"
"13037",158,"before tea, old John Abdy’s son wanted to speak with him. Poor old","Emma"
"13038",158,"John, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father","Emma"
"13039",158,"twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very","Emma"
"13040",158,"poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints—I must go and see him","Emma"
"13041",158,"to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poor","Emma"
"13042",158,"John’s son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he","Emma"
"13043",158,"is very well to do himself, you know, being head man at the Crown,","Emma"
"13044",158,"ostler, and every thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep his","Emma"
"13045",158,"father without some help; and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us","Emma"
"13046",158,"what John ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about the","Emma"
"13047",158,"chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to","Emma"
"13048",158,"Richmond. That was what happened before tea. It was after tea that Jane","Emma"
"13049",158,"spoke to Mrs. Elton.”","Emma"
"13050",158,"","Emma"
"13051",158,"Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this","Emma"
"13052",158,"circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that she","Emma"
"13053",158,"could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill’s","Emma"
"13054",158,"going, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.","Emma"
"13055",158,"","Emma"
"13056",158,"What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the","Emma"
"13057",158,"accumulation of the ostler’s own knowledge, and the knowledge of the","Emma"
"13058",158,"servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond","Emma"
"13059",158,"soon after the return of the party from Box Hill—which messenger,","Emma"
"13060",158,"however, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had","Emma"
"13061",158,"sent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable","Emma"
"13062",158,"account of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming","Emma"
"13063",158,"back beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having","Emma"
"13064",158,"resolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse","Emma"
"13065",158,"seeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the","Emma"
"13066",158,"Crown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy","Emma"
"13067",158,"going a good pace, and driving very steady.","Emma"
"13068",158,"","Emma"
"13069",158,"There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it","Emma"
"13070",158,"caught Emma’s attention only as it united with the subject which","Emma"
"13071",158,"already engaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill’s","Emma"
"13072",158,"importance in the world, and Jane Fairfax’s, struck her; one was every","Emma"
"13073",158,"thing, the other nothing—and she sat musing on the difference of","Emma"
"13074",158,"woman’s destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed,","Emma"
"13075",158,"till roused by Miss Bates’s saying,","Emma"
"13076",158,"","Emma"
"13077",158,"“Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to become","Emma"
"13078",158,"of that?—Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.—‘You","Emma"
"13079",158,"must go,’ said she. ‘You and I must part. You will have no business","Emma"
"13080",158,"here.—Let it stay, however,’ said she; ‘give it houseroom till Colonel","Emma"
"13081",158,"Campbell comes back. I shall talk about it to him; he will settle for","Emma"
"13082",158,"me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.’—And to this day, I do","Emma"
"13083",158,"believe, she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter’s.”","Emma"
"13084",158,"","Emma"
"13085",158,"Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of","Emma"
"13086",158,"all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,","Emma"
"13087",158,"that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long","Emma"
"13088",158,"enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to","Emma"
"13089",158,"say of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave.","Emma"

"13094",158,"CHAPTER IX","Emma"
"13095",158,"","Emma"
"13096",158,"","Emma"
"13097",158,"Emma’s pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;","Emma"
"13098",158,"but on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her. Mr.","Emma"
"13099",158,"Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting","Emma"
"13100",158,"with her father.—Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner","Emma"
"13101",158,"decidedly graver than usual, said,","Emma"
"13102",158,"","Emma"
"13103",158,"“I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,","Emma"
"13104",158,"and therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend","Emma"
"13105",158,"a few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say,","Emma"
"13106",158,"besides the ‘love,’ which nobody carries?”","Emma"
"13107",158,"","Emma"
"13108",158,"“Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?”","Emma"
"13109",158,"","Emma"
"13110",158,"“Yes—rather—I have been thinking of it some little time.”","Emma"
"13111",158,"","Emma"
"13112",158,"Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. Time,","Emma"
"13113",158,"however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends","Emma"
"13114",158,"again. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going—her father","Emma"
"13115",158,"began his inquiries.","Emma"
"13116",158,"","Emma"
"13117",158,"“Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?—And how did you find my","Emma"
"13118",158,"worthy old friend and her daughter?—I dare say they must have been very","Emma"
"13119",158,"much obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and","Emma"
"13120",158,"Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always so","Emma"
"13121",158,"attentive to them!”","Emma"
"13122",158,"","Emma"
"13123",158,"Emma’s colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile,","Emma"
"13124",158,"and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr.","Emma"
"13125",158,"Knightley.—It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in","Emma"
"13126",158,"her favour, as if his eyes received the truth from hers, and all that","Emma"
"13127",158,"had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.—","Emma"
"13128",158,"He looked at her with a glow of regard. She was warmly gratified—and in","Emma"
"13129",158,"another moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common","Emma"
"13130",158,"friendliness on his part.—He took her hand;—whether she had not herself","Emma"
"13131",158,"made the first motion, she could not say—she might, perhaps, have","Emma"
"13132",158,"rather offered it—but he took her hand, pressed it, and certainly was","Emma"
"13133",158,"on the point of carrying it to his lips—when, from some fancy or other,","Emma"
"13134",158,"he suddenly let it go.—Why he should feel such a scruple, why he should","Emma"
"13135",158,"change his mind when it was all but done, she could not perceive.—He","Emma"
"13136",158,"would have judged better, she thought, if he had not stopped.—The","Emma"
"13137",158,"intention, however, was indubitable; and whether it was that his","Emma"
"13138",158,"manners had in general so little gallantry, or however else it","Emma"
"13139",158,"happened, but she thought nothing became him more.—It was with him, of","Emma"
"13140",158,"so simple, yet so dignified a nature.—She could not but recall the","Emma"
"13141",158,"attempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect amity.—He left","Emma"
"13142",158,"them immediately afterwards—gone in a moment. He always moved with the","Emma"
"13143",158,"alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but","Emma"
"13144",158,"now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance.","Emma"
"13145",158,"","Emma"
"13146",158,"Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished she","Emma"
"13147",158,"had left her ten minutes earlier;—it would have been a great pleasure","Emma"
"13148",158,"to talk over Jane Fairfax’s situation with Mr. Knightley.—Neither would","Emma"
"13149",158,"she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square, for she knew","Emma"
"13150",158,"how much his visit would be enjoyed—but it might have happened at a","Emma"
"13151",158,"better time—and to have had longer notice of it, would have been","Emma"
"13152",158,"pleasanter.—They parted thorough friends, however; she could not be","Emma"
"13153",158,"deceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and his unfinished","Emma"
"13154",158,"gallantry;—it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered","Emma"
"13155",158,"his good opinion.—He had been sitting with them half an hour, she","Emma"
"13156",158,"found. It was a pity that she had not come back earlier!","Emma"
"13157",158,"","Emma"
"13158",158,"In the hope of diverting her father’s thoughts from the","Emma"
"13159",158,"disagreeableness of Mr. Knightley’s going to London; and going so","Emma"
"13160",158,"suddenly; and going on horseback, which she knew would be all very bad;","Emma"
"13161",158,"Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on the","Emma"
"13162",158,"effect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,—interested,","Emma"
"13163",158,"without disturbing him. He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax’s","Emma"
"13164",158,"going out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully, but Mr.","Emma"
"13165",158,"Knightley’s going to London had been an unexpected blow.","Emma"
"13166",158,"","Emma"
"13167",158,"“I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably","Emma"
"13168",158,"settled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say","Emma"
"13169",158,"her acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a dry","Emma"
"13170",158,"situation, and that her health will be taken good care of. It ought to","Emma"
"13171",158,"be a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor’s always was with me.","Emma"
"13172",158,"You know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor","Emma"
"13173",158,"was to us. And I hope she will be better off in one respect, and not be","Emma"
"13174",158,"induced to go away after it has been her home so long.”","Emma"
"13175",158,"","Emma"
"13176",158,"The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else","Emma"
"13177",158,"into the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announce the","Emma"
"13178",158,"death of Mrs. Churchill! Though her nephew had had no particular reason","Emma"
"13179",158,"to hasten back on her account, she had not lived above six-and-thirty","Emma"
"13180",158,"hours after his return. A sudden seizure of a different nature from any","Emma"
"13181",158,"thing foreboded by her general state, had carried her off after a short","Emma"
"13182",158,"struggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.","Emma"
"13183",158,"","Emma"
"13184",158,"It was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree of","Emma"
"13185",158,"gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the","Emma"
"13186",158,"surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know where","Emma"
"13187",158,"she would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops","Emma"
"13188",158,"to folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to be","Emma"
"13189",158,"disagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.","Emma"
"13190",158,"Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was","Emma"
"13191",158,"now spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she was fully","Emma"
"13192",158,"justified. She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. The","Emma"
"13193",158,"event acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of","Emma"
"13194",158,"imaginary complaints.","Emma"
"13195",158,"","Emma"
"13196",158,"“Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:","Emma"
"13197",158,"more than any body had ever supposed—and continual pain would try the","Emma"
"13198",158,"temper. It was a sad event—a great shock—with all her faults, what","Emma"
"13199",158,"would Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill’s loss would be","Emma"
"13200",158,"dreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it.”—Even Mr.","Emma"
"13201",158,"Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, “Ah! poor woman,","Emma"
"13202",158,"who would have thought it!” and resolved, that his mourning should be","Emma"
"13203",158,"as handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over","Emma"
"13204",158,"her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady.","Emma"
"13205",158,"How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. It","Emma"
"13206",158,"was also a very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs.","Emma"
"13207",158,"Churchill, the grief of her husband—her mind glanced over them both","Emma"
"13208",158,"with awe and compassion—and then rested with lightened feelings on how","Emma"
"13209",158,"Frank might be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She saw","Emma"
"13210",158,"in a moment all the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith","Emma"
"13211",158,"would have nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of his","Emma"
"13212",158,"wife, was feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into","Emma"
"13213",158,"any thing by his nephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the","Emma"
"13214",158,"nephew should form the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the","Emma"
"13215",158,"cause, Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed.","Emma"
"13216",158,"","Emma"
"13217",158,"Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great","Emma"
"13218",158,"self-command. What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed","Emma"
"13219",158,"nothing. Emma was gratified, to observe such a proof in her of","Emma"
"13220",158,"strengthened character, and refrained from any allusion that might","Emma"
"13221",158,"endanger its maintenance. They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill’s","Emma"
"13222",158,"death with mutual forbearance.","Emma"
"13223",158,"","Emma"
"13224",158,"Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating all","Emma"
"13225",158,"that was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr. Churchill","Emma"
"13226",158,"was better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the","Emma"
"13227",158,"departure of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a","Emma"
"13228",158,"very old friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a","Emma"
"13229",158,"visit the last ten years. At present, there was nothing to be done for","Emma"
"13230",158,"Harriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible","Emma"
"13231",158,"on Emma’s side.","Emma"
"13232",158,"","Emma"
"13233",158,"It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose","Emma"
"13234",158,"prospects were closing, while Harriet’s opened, and whose engagements","Emma"
"13235",158,"now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her","Emma"
"13236",158,"kindness—and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. She had scarcely","Emma"
"13237",158,"a stronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person, whom she","Emma"
"13238",158,"had been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she","Emma"
"13239",158,"would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. She wanted","Emma"
"13240",158,"to be of use to her; wanted to shew a value for her society, and","Emma"
"13241",158,"testify respect and consideration. She resolved to prevail on her to","Emma"
"13242",158,"spend a day at Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation","Emma"
"13243",158,"was refused, and by a verbal message. “Miss Fairfax was not well enough","Emma"
"13244",158,"to write;” and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it","Emma"
"13245",158,"appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited,","Emma"
"13246",158,"though against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering","Emma"
"13247",158,"under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him","Emma"
"13248",158,"doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge’s at the time","Emma"
"13249",158,"proposed. Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged—appetite","Emma"
"13250",158,"quite gone—and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms,","Emma"
"13251",158,"nothing touching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing","Emma"
"13252",158,"apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her. He thought","Emma"
"13253",158,"she had undertaken more than she was equal to, and that she felt it so","Emma"
"13254",158,"herself, though she would not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Her","Emma"
"13255",158,"present home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous","Emma"
"13256",158,"disorder:—confined always to one room;—he could have wished it","Emma"
"13257",158,"otherwise—and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must","Emma"
"13258",158,"acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that","Emma"
"13259",158,"description. Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were,","Emma"
"13260",158,"in fact, only too great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived","Emma"
"13261",158,"more evil than good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern;","Emma"
"13262",158,"grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some","Emma"
"13263",158,"way of being useful. To take her—be it only an hour or two—from her","Emma"
"13264",158,"aunt, to give her change of air and scene, and quiet rational","Emma"
"13265",158,"conversation, even for an hour or two, might do her good; and the","Emma"
"13266",158,"following morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling language","Emma"
"13267",158,"she could command, that she would call for her in the carriage at any","Emma"
"13268",158,"hour that Jane would name—mentioning that she had Mr. Perry’s decided","Emma"
"13269",158,"opinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient. The answer was","Emma"
"13270",158,"only in this short note:","Emma"
"13271",158,"","Emma"
"13272",158,"“Miss Fairfax’s compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any","Emma"
"13273",158,"exercise.”","Emma"
"13274",158,"","Emma"
"13275",158,"Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was","Emma"
"13276",158,"impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed","Emma"
"13277",158,"indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best","Emma"
"13278",158,"counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of the","Emma"
"13279",158,"answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates’s,","Emma"
"13280",158,"in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her—but it would not","Emma"
"13281",158,"do;—Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing","Emma"
"13282",158,"with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest","Emma"
"13283",158,"service—and every thing that message could do was tried—but all in","Emma"
"13284",158,"vain. Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was quite","Emma"
"13285",158,"unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her","Emma"
"13286",158,"worse.—Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers;","Emma"
"13287",158,"but, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear","Emma"
"13288",158,"that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.","Emma"
"13289",158,"“Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any","Emma"
"13290",158,"body—any body at all—Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied—and Mrs.","Emma"
"13291",158,"Cole had made such a point—and Mrs. Perry had said so much—but, except","Emma"
"13292",158,"them, Jane would really see nobody.”","Emma"
"13293",158,"","Emma"
"13294",158,"Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,","Emma"
"13295",158,"and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could","Emma"
"13296",158,"she feel any right of preference herself—she submitted, therefore, and","Emma"
"13297",158,"only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece’s appetite and diet,","Emma"
"13298",158,"which she longed to be able to assist. On that subject poor Miss Bates","Emma"
"13299",158,"was very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any","Emma"
"13300",158,"thing:—Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they","Emma"
"13301",158,"could command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was","Emma"
"13302",158,"distasteful.","Emma"
"13303",158,"","Emma"
"13304",158,"Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an","Emma"
"13305",158,"examination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality","Emma"
"13306",158,"was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note. In","Emma"
"13307",158,"half an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from","Emma"
"13308",158,"Miss Bates, but “dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being","Emma"
"13309",158,"sent back; it was a thing she could not take—and, moreover, she","Emma"
"13310",158,"insisted on her saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing.”","Emma"
"13311",158,"","Emma"
"13312",158,"When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering","Emma"
"13313",158,"about the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon of","Emma"
"13314",158,"the very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal to any","Emma"
"13315",158,"exercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage,","Emma"
"13316",158,"she could have no doubt—putting every thing together—that Jane was","Emma"
"13317",158,"resolved to receive no kindness from _her_. She was sorry, very sorry.","Emma"
"13318",158,"Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable","Emma"
"13319",158,"from this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and","Emma"
"13320",158,"inequality of powers; and it mortified her that she was given so little","Emma"
"13321",158,"credit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend:","Emma"
"13322",158,"but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good,","Emma"
"13323",158,"and of being able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been","Emma"
"13324",158,"privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have","Emma"
"13325",158,"seen into her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any","Emma"

"13331",158,"CHAPTER X","Emma"
"13332",158,"","Emma"
"13333",158,"","Emma"
"13334",158,"One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill’s decease, Emma was","Emma"
"13335",158,"called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who “could not stay five minutes, and","Emma"
"13336",158,"wanted particularly to speak with her.”—He met her at the parlour-door,","Emma"
"13337",158,"and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of his voice,","Emma"
"13338",158,"sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,","Emma"
"13339",158,"","Emma"
"13340",158,"“Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?—Do, if it be","Emma"
"13341",158,"possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.”","Emma"
"13342",158,"","Emma"
"13343",158,"“Is she unwell?”","Emma"
"13344",158,"","Emma"
"13345",158,"“No, no, not at all—only a little agitated. She would have ordered the","Emma"
"13346",158,"carriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_, and that you","Emma"
"13347",158,"know—(nodding towards her father)—Humph!—Can you come?”","Emma"
"13348",158,"","Emma"
"13349",158,"“Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what","Emma"
"13350",158,"you ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?—Is she really not","Emma"
"13351",158,"ill?”","Emma"
"13352",158,"","Emma"
"13353",158,"“Depend upon me—but ask no more questions. You will know it all in","Emma"
"13354",158,"time. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!”","Emma"
"13355",158,"","Emma"
"13356",158,"To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Something","Emma"
"13357",158,"really important seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend was","Emma"
"13358",158,"well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her","Emma"
"13359",158,"father, that she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston were soon","Emma"
"13360",158,"out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for","Emma"
"13361",158,"Randalls.","Emma"
"13362",158,"","Emma"
"13363",158,"“Now,”—said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,—“now","Emma"
"13364",158,"Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.”","Emma"
"13365",158,"","Emma"
"13366",158,"“No, no,”—he gravely replied.—“Don’t ask me. I promised my wife to","Emma"
"13367",158,"leave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can. Do not","Emma"
"13368",158,"be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.”","Emma"
"13369",158,"","Emma"
"13370",158,"“Break it to me,” cried Emma, standing still with terror.—“Good","Emma"
"13371",158,"God!—Mr. Weston, tell me at once.—Something has happened in Brunswick","Emma"
"13372",158,"Square. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what","Emma"
"13373",158,"it is.”","Emma"
"13374",158,"","Emma"
"13375",158,"“No, indeed you are mistaken.”—","Emma"
"13376",158,"","Emma"
"13377",158,"“Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.—Consider how many of my dearest","Emma"
"13378",158,"friends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?—I charge you","Emma"
"13379",158,"by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.”","Emma"
"13380",158,"","Emma"
"13381",158,"“Upon my word, Emma.”—","Emma"
"13382",158,"","Emma"
"13383",158,"“Your word!—why not your honour!—why not say upon your honour, that it","Emma"
"13384",158,"has nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!—What can be to be","Emma"
"13385",158,"_broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?”","Emma"
"13386",158,"","Emma"
"13387",158,"“Upon my honour,” said he very seriously, “it does not. It is not in","Emma"
"13388",158,"the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of","Emma"
"13389",158,"Knightley.”","Emma"
"13390",158,"","Emma"
"13391",158,"Emma’s courage returned, and she walked on.","Emma"
"13392",158,"","Emma"
"13393",158,"“I was wrong,” he continued, “in talking of its being _broke_ to you. I","Emma"
"13394",158,"should not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern","Emma"
"13395",158,"you—it concerns only myself,—that is, we hope.—Humph!—In short, my dear","Emma"
"13396",158,"Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. I don’t say that","Emma"
"13397",158,"it is not a disagreeable business—but things might be much worse.—If we","Emma"
"13398",158,"walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.”","Emma"
"13399",158,"","Emma"
"13400",158,"Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort. She","Emma"
"13401",158,"asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy, and","Emma"
"13402",158,"that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money","Emma"
"13403",158,"concern—something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the","Emma"
"13404",158,"circumstances of the family,—something which the late event at Richmond","Emma"
"13405",158,"had brought forward. Her fancy was very active. Half a dozen natural","Emma"
"13406",158,"children, perhaps—and poor Frank cut off!—This, though very","Emma"
"13407",158,"undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. It inspired little","Emma"
"13408",158,"more than an animating curiosity.","Emma"
"13409",158,"","Emma"
"13410",158,"“Who is that gentleman on horseback?” said she, as they","Emma"
"13411",158,"proceeded—speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret,","Emma"
"13412",158,"than with any other view.","Emma"
"13413",158,"","Emma"
"13414",158,"“I do not know.—One of the Otways.—Not Frank;—it is not Frank, I assure","Emma"
"13415",158,"you. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by this time.”","Emma"
"13416",158,"","Emma"
"13417",158,"“Has your son been with you, then?”","Emma"
"13418",158,"","Emma"
"13419",158,"“Oh! yes—did not you know?—Well, well, never mind.”","Emma"
"13420",158,"","Emma"
"13421",158,"For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded","Emma"
"13422",158,"and demure,","Emma"
"13423",158,"","Emma"
"13424",158,"“Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.”","Emma"
"13425",158,"","Emma"
"13426",158,"They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.—“Well, my dear,” said","Emma"
"13427",158,"he, as they entered the room—“I have brought her, and now I hope you","Emma"
"13428",158,"will soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use in","Emma"
"13429",158,"delay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.”—And Emma distinctly","Emma"
"13430",158,"heard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,—“I have","Emma"
"13431",158,"been as good as my word. She has not the least idea.”","Emma"
"13432",158,"","Emma"
"13433",158,"Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,","Emma"
"13434",158,"that Emma’s uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she","Emma"
"13435",158,"eagerly said,","Emma"
"13436",158,"","Emma"
"13437",158,"“What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I","Emma"
"13438",158,"find, has occurred;—do let me know directly what it is. I have been","Emma"
"13439",158,"walking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense. Do","Emma"
"13440",158,"not let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your","Emma"
"13441",158,"distress, whatever it may be.”","Emma"
"13442",158,"","Emma"
"13443",158,"“Have you indeed no idea?” said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.","Emma"
"13444",158,"“Cannot you, my dear Emma—cannot you form a guess as to what you are to","Emma"
"13445",158,"hear?”","Emma"
"13446",158,"","Emma"
"13447",158,"“So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.”","Emma"
"13448",158,"","Emma"
"13449",158,"“You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;”","Emma"
"13450",158,"(resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) “He has","Emma"
"13451",158,"been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It is","Emma"
"13452",158,"impossible to express our surprize. He came to speak to his father on a","Emma"
"13453",158,"subject,—to announce an attachment—”","Emma"
"13454",158,"","Emma"
"13455",158,"She stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of","Emma"
"13456",158,"Harriet.","Emma"
"13457",158,"","Emma"
"13458",158,"“More than an attachment, indeed,” resumed Mrs. Weston; “an","Emma"
"13459",158,"engagement—a positive engagement.—What will you say, Emma—what will any","Emma"
"13460",158,"body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are","Emma"
"13461",158,"engaged;—nay, that they have been long engaged!”","Emma"
"13462",158,"","Emma"
"13463",158,"Emma even jumped with surprize;—and, horror-struck, exclaimed,","Emma"
"13464",158,"","Emma"
"13465",158,"“Jane Fairfax!—Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?”","Emma"
"13466",158,"","Emma"
"13467",158,"“You may well be amazed,” returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her","Emma"
"13468",158,"eyes, and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to","Emma"
"13469",158,"recover— “You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been a","Emma"
"13470",158,"solemn engagement between them ever since October—formed at Weymouth,","Emma"
"13471",158,"and kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it but","Emma"
"13472",158,"themselves—neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.—It is so","Emma"
"13473",158,"wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet","Emma"
"13474",158,"almost incredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.—I thought I knew","Emma"
"13475",158,"him.”","Emma"
"13476",158,"","Emma"
"13477",158,"Emma scarcely heard what was said.—Her mind was divided between two","Emma"
"13478",158,"ideas—her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; and","Emma"
"13479",158,"poor Harriet;—and for some time she could only exclaim, and require","Emma"
"13480",158,"confirmation, repeated confirmation.","Emma"
"13481",158,"","Emma"
"13482",158,"“Well,” said she at last, trying to recover herself; “this is a","Emma"
"13483",158,"circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at","Emma"
"13484",158,"all comprehend it. What!—engaged to her all the winter—before either of","Emma"
"13485",158,"them came to Highbury?”","Emma"
"13486",158,"","Emma"
"13487",158,"“Engaged since October,—secretly engaged.—It has hurt me, Emma, very","Emma"
"13488",158,"much. It has hurt his father equally. _Some_ _part_ of his conduct we","Emma"
"13489",158,"cannot excuse.”","Emma"
"13490",158,"","Emma"
"13491",158,"Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, “I will not pretend _not_ to","Emma"
"13492",158,"understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured","Emma"
"13493",158,"that no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are","Emma"
"13494",158,"apprehensive of.”","Emma"
"13495",158,"","Emma"
"13496",158,"Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma’s countenance was as","Emma"
"13497",158,"steady as her words.","Emma"
"13498",158,"","Emma"
"13499",158,"“That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my","Emma"
"13500",158,"present perfect indifference,” she continued, “I will farther tell you,","Emma"
"13501",158,"that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I","Emma"
"13502",158,"did like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him—nay,","Emma"
"13503",158,"was attached—and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.","Emma"
"13504",158,"Fortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past,","Emma"
"13505",158,"for at least these three months, cared nothing about him. You may","Emma"
"13506",158,"believe me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth.”","Emma"
"13507",158,"","Emma"
"13508",158,"Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find","Emma"
"13509",158,"utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more good","Emma"
"13510",158,"than any thing else in the world could do.","Emma"
"13511",158,"","Emma"
"13512",158,"“Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,” said she. “On","Emma"
"13513",158,"this point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that you","Emma"
"13514",158,"might be attached to each other—and we were persuaded that it was so.—","Emma"
"13515",158,"Imagine what we have been feeling on your account.”","Emma"
"13516",158,"","Emma"
"13517",158,"“I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful","Emma"
"13518",158,"wonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit _him_, Mrs. Weston;","Emma"
"13519",158,"and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. What right had he to","Emma"
"13520",158,"come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners so","Emma"
"13521",158,"_very_ disengaged? What right had he to endeavour to please, as he","Emma"
"13522",158,"certainly did—to distinguish any one young woman with persevering","Emma"
"13523",158,"attention, as he certainly did—while he really belonged to another?—How","Emma"
"13524",158,"could he tell what mischief he might be doing?—How could he tell that","Emma"
"13525",158,"he might not be making me in love with him?—very wrong, very wrong","Emma"
"13526",158,"indeed.”","Emma"
"13527",158,"","Emma"
"13528",158,"“From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine—”","Emma"
"13529",158,"","Emma"
"13530",158,"“And how could _she_ bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness! to","Emma"
"13531",158,"look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,","Emma"
"13532",158,"before her face, and not resent it.—That is a degree of placidity,","Emma"
"13533",158,"which I can neither comprehend nor respect.”","Emma"
"13534",158,"","Emma"
"13535",158,"“There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly.","Emma"
"13536",158,"He had not time to enter into much explanation. He was here only a","Emma"
"13537",158,"quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow the","Emma"
"13538",158,"full use even of the time he could stay—but that there had been","Emma"
"13539",158,"misunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed, seemed","Emma"
"13540",158,"to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very","Emma"
"13541",158,"possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct.”","Emma"
"13542",158,"","Emma"
"13543",158,"“Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston—it is too calm a censure. Much, much","Emma"
"13544",158,"beyond impropriety!—It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him","Emma"
"13545",158,"in my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!—None of that upright","Emma"
"13546",158,"integrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain","Emma"
"13547",158,"of trick and littleness, which a man should display in every","Emma"

"13549",158,"","Emma"
"13550",158,"“Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been wrong","Emma"
"13551",158,"in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for his having","Emma"
"13552",158,"many, very many, good qualities; and—”","Emma"
"13553",158,"","Emma"
"13554",158,"“Good God!” cried Emma, not attending to her.—“Mrs. Smallridge, too!","Emma"
"13555",158,"Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by","Emma"
"13556",158,"such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself—to suffer her","Emma"
"13557",158,"even to think of such a measure!”","Emma"
"13558",158,"","Emma"
"13559",158,"“He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquit","Emma"

"13561",158,"least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.—Till yesterday, I","Emma"
"13562",158,"know he said he was in the dark as to her plans. They burst on him, I","Emma"
"13563",158,"do not know how, but by some letter or message—and it was the discovery","Emma"
"13564",158,"of what she was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined","Emma"
"13565",158,"him to come forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on","Emma"
"13566",158,"his kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of","Emma"
"13567",158,"concealment that had been carrying on so long.”","Emma"
"13568",158,"","Emma"
"13569",158,"Emma began to listen better.","Emma"
"13570",158,"","Emma"
"13571",158,"“I am to hear from him soon,” continued Mrs. Weston. “He told me at","Emma"
"13572",158,"parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which","Emma"
"13573",158,"seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Let","Emma"
"13574",158,"us wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. It","Emma"
"13575",158,"may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be","Emma"
"13576",158,"understood. Don’t let us be severe, don’t let us be in a hurry to","Emma"
"13577",158,"condemn him. Let us have patience. I must love him; and now that I am","Emma"
"13578",158,"satisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious","Emma"
"13579",158,"for its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They must","Emma"
"13580",158,"both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and","Emma"
"13581",158,"concealment.”","Emma"
"13582",158,"","Emma"
"13583",158,"“_His_ sufferings,” replied Emma dryly, “do not appear to have done him","Emma"
"13584",158,"much harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?”","Emma"
"13585",158,"","Emma"
"13586",158,"“Most favourably for his nephew—gave his consent with scarcely a","Emma"
"13587",158,"difficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that","Emma"
"13588",158,"family! While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have","Emma"
"13589",158,"been a hope, a chance, a possibility;—but scarcely are her remains at","Emma"
"13590",158,"rest in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly","Emma"
"13591",158,"opposite to what she would have required. What a blessing it is, when","Emma"
"13592",158,"undue influence does not survive the grave!—He gave his consent with","Emma"
"13593",158,"very little persuasion.”","Emma"
"13594",158,"","Emma"
"13595",158,"“Ah!” thought Emma, “he would have done as much for Harriet.”","Emma"
"13596",158,"","Emma"
"13597",158,"“This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this","Emma"
"13598",158,"morning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates’s, I fancy, some time—and","Emma"
"13599",158,"then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle,","Emma"
"13600",158,"to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you,","Emma"
"13601",158,"he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.—He was very much","Emma"
"13602",158,"agitated—very much, indeed—to a degree that made him appear quite a","Emma"
"13603",158,"different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.—In","Emma"
"13604",158,"addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so","Emma"
"13605",158,"very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of—and there was","Emma"
"13606",158,"every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.”","Emma"
"13607",158,"","Emma"
"13608",158,"“And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with","Emma"
"13609",158,"such perfect secresy?—The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know","Emma"
"13610",158,"of the engagement?”","Emma"
"13611",158,"","Emma"
"13612",158,"Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.","Emma"
"13613",158,"","Emma"
"13614",158,"“None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being","Emma"
"13615",158,"in the world but their two selves.”","Emma"
"13616",158,"","Emma"
"13617",158,"“Well,” said Emma, “I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the","Emma"
"13618",158,"idea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it a very","Emma"
"13619",158,"abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system of","Emma"
"13620",158,"hypocrisy and deceit,—espionage, and treachery?—To come among us with","Emma"
"13621",158,"professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret to","Emma"
"13622",158,"judge us all!—Here have we been, the whole winter and spring,","Emma"
"13623",158,"completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth","Emma"
"13624",158,"and honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been","Emma"
"13625",158,"carrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and","Emma"
"13626",158,"words that were never meant for both to hear.—They must take the","Emma"
"13627",158,"consequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not","Emma"
"13628",158,"perfectly agreeable!”","Emma"
"13629",158,"","Emma"
"13630",158,"“I am quite easy on that head,” replied Mrs. Weston. “I am very sure","Emma"
"13631",158,"that I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might","Emma"
"13632",158,"not have heard.”","Emma"
"13633",158,"","Emma"
"13634",158,"“You are in luck.—Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you","Emma"
"13635",158,"imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.”","Emma"
"13636",158,"","Emma"
"13637",158,"“True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss","Emma"
"13638",158,"Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; and","Emma"
"13639",158,"as to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.”","Emma"
"13640",158,"","Emma"
"13641",158,"At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the","Emma"
"13642",158,"window, evidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which invited","Emma"
"13643",158,"him in; and, while he was coming round, added, “Now, dearest Emma, let","Emma"
"13644",158,"me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at","Emma"
"13645",158,"ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the","Emma"
"13646",158,"best of it—and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her","Emma"
"13647",158,"favour. It is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not","Emma"
"13648",158,"feel that, why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance","Emma"
"13649",158,"for him, for Frank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to a","Emma"
"13650",158,"girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always","Emma"
"13651",158,"given her credit for—and still am disposed to give her credit for, in","Emma"
"13652",158,"spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right. And","Emma"
"13653",158,"how much may be said in her situation for even that error!”","Emma"
"13654",158,"","Emma"
"13655",158,"“Much, indeed!” cried Emma feelingly. “If a woman can ever be excused","Emma"
"13656",158,"for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane","Emma"
"13657",158,"Fairfax’s.—Of such, one may almost say, that ‘the world is not their’s,","Emma"
"13658",158,"nor the world’s law.’”","Emma"
"13659",158,"","Emma"
"13660",158,"She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,","Emma"
"13661",158,"exclaiming,","Emma"
"13662",158,"","Emma"
"13663",158,"“A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! This was a","Emma"
"13664",158,"device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent","Emma"
"13665",158,"of guessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost half","Emma"
"13666",158,"your property, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter of","Emma"
"13667",158,"condolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.—I congratulate","Emma"
"13668",158,"you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of","Emma"
"13669",158,"the most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your","Emma"
"13670",158,"daughter.”","Emma"
"13671",158,"","Emma"
"13672",158,"A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was as","Emma"
"13673",158,"right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits","Emma"
"13674",158,"was immediate. His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he","Emma"
"13675",158,"shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the","Emma"
"13676",158,"subject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted time and","Emma"
"13677",158,"persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing. His companions","Emma"
"13678",158,"suggested only what could palliate imprudence, or smooth objections;","Emma"
"13679",158,"and by the time they had talked it all over together, and he had talked","Emma"
"13680",158,"it all over again with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was","Emma"
"13681",158,"become perfectly reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best","Emma"
"13682",158,"thing that Frank could possibly have done.","Emma"

"13687",158,"CHAPTER XI","Emma"
"13688",158,"","Emma"
"13689",158,"","Emma"
"13690",158,"“Harriet, poor Harriet!”—Those were the words; in them lay the","Emma"
"13691",158,"tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted","Emma"
"13692",158,"the real misery of the business to her. Frank Churchill had behaved","Emma"
"13693",158,"very ill by herself—very ill in many ways,—but it was not so much _his_","Emma"
"13694",158,"behaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him. It was the","Emma"
"13695",158,"scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet’s account, that gave the","Emma"
"13696",158,"deepest hue to his offence.—Poor Harriet! to be a second time the dupe","Emma"
"13697",158,"of her misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken","Emma"
"13698",158,"prophetically, when he once said, “Emma, you have been no friend to","Emma"
"13699",158,"Harriet Smith.”—She was afraid she had done her nothing but","Emma"
"13700",158,"disservice.—It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this","Emma"
"13701",158,"instance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of","Emma"
"13702",158,"the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise","Emma"
"13703",158,"never have entered Harriet’s imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged","Emma"
"13704",158,"her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever","Emma"
"13705",158,"given her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty of","Emma"
"13706",158,"having encouraged what she might have repressed. She might have","Emma"
"13707",158,"prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her influence","Emma"
"13708",158,"would have been enough. And now she was very conscious that she ought","Emma"
"13709",158,"to have prevented them.—She felt that she had been risking her friend’s","Emma"
"13710",158,"happiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have","Emma"
"13711",158,"directed her to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to think","Emma"
"13712",158,"of him, and that there were five hundred chances to one against his","Emma"
"13713",158,"ever caring for her.—“But, with common sense,” she added, “I am afraid","Emma"
"13714",158,"I have had little to do.”","Emma"
"13715",158,"","Emma"
"13716",158,"She was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been angry","Emma"
"13717",158,"with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.—As for Jane","Emma"
"13718",158,"Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present","Emma"
"13719",158,"solicitude on her account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need no","Emma"
"13720",158,"longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health","Emma"
"13721",158,"having, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.—Her","Emma"
"13722",158,"days of insignificance and evil were over.—She would soon be well, and","Emma"
"13723",158,"happy, and prosperous.—Emma could now imagine why her own attentions","Emma"
"13724",158,"had been slighted. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. No","Emma"
"13725",158,"doubt it had been from jealousy.—In Jane’s eyes she had been a rival;","Emma"
"13726",158,"and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be","Emma"
"13727",158,"repulsed. An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,","Emma"
"13728",158,"and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. She","Emma"
"13729",158,"understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from","Emma"
"13730",158,"the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged that","Emma"
"13731",158,"Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her","Emma"
"13732",158,"desert. But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was","Emma"
"13733",158,"little sympathy to be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful","Emma"
"13734",158,"that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.","Emma"
"13735",158,"Considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and","Emma"
"13736",158,"judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet’s mind, producing","Emma"
"13737",158,"reserve and self-command, it would.—She must communicate the painful","Emma"
"13738",158,"truth, however, and as soon as possible. An injunction of secresy had","Emma"
"13739",158,"been among Mr. Weston’s parting words. “For the present, the whole","Emma"
"13740",158,"affair was to be completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a point of","Emma"
"13741",158,"it, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost; and","Emma"
"13742",158,"every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.”—Emma had","Emma"
"13743",158,"promised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It was her superior duty.","Emma"
"13744",158,"","Emma"
"13745",158,"In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost","Emma"
"13746",158,"ridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicate","Emma"
"13747",158,"office to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through","Emma"
"13748",158,"by herself. The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to","Emma"
"13749",158,"her, she was now to be anxiously announcing to another. Her heart beat","Emma"
"13750",158,"quick on hearing Harriet’s footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had","Emma"
"13751",158,"poor Mrs. Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls. Could the","Emma"
"13752",158,"event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!—But of that,","Emma"
"13753",158,"unfortunately, there could be no chance.","Emma"
"13754",158,"","Emma"
"13755",158,"“Well, Miss Woodhouse!” cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room—“is","Emma"
"13756",158,"not this the oddest news that ever was?”","Emma"
"13757",158,"","Emma"
"13758",158,"“What news do you mean?” replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or","Emma"
"13759",158,"voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.","Emma"
"13760",158,"","Emma"
"13761",158,"“About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh!—you","Emma"
"13762",158,"need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me","Emma"
"13763",158,"himself. I met him just now. He told me it was to be a great secret;","Emma"
"13764",158,"and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but","Emma"
"13765",158,"you, but he said you knew it.”","Emma"
"13766",158,"","Emma"
"13767",158,"“What did Mr. Weston tell you?”—said Emma, still perplexed.","Emma"
"13768",158,"","Emma"
"13769",158,"“Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill","Emma"
"13770",158,"are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one","Emma"
"13771",158,"another this long while. How very odd!”","Emma"
"13772",158,"","Emma"
"13773",158,"It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet’s behaviour was so extremely odd, that","Emma"
"13774",158,"Emma did not know how to understand it. Her character appeared","Emma"
"13775",158,"absolutely changed. She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or","Emma"
"13776",158,"disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked at","Emma"
"13777",158,"her, quite unable to speak.","Emma"
"13778",158,"","Emma"
"13779",158,"“Had you any idea,” cried Harriet, “of his being in love with her?—You,","Emma"
"13780",158,"perhaps, might.—You (blushing as she spoke) who can see into every","Emma"
"13781",158,"body’s heart; but nobody else—”","Emma"
"13782",158,"","Emma"
"13783",158,"“Upon my word,” said Emma, “I begin to doubt my having any such talent.","Emma"
"13784",158,"Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached to","Emma"
"13785",158,"another woman at the very time that I was—tacitly, if not","Emma"
"13786",158,"openly—encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?—I never had","Emma"
"13787",158,"the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank","Emma"
"13788",158,"Churchill’s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be very","Emma"
"13789",158,"sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.”","Emma"
"13790",158,"","Emma"
"13791",158,"“Me!” cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. “Why should you caution","Emma"
"13792",158,"me?—You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.”","Emma"
"13793",158,"","Emma"
"13794",158,"“I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,” replied","Emma"
"13795",158,"Emma, smiling; “but you do not mean to deny that there was a time—and","Emma"
"13796",158,"not very distant either—when you gave me reason to understand that you","Emma"
"13797",158,"did care about him?”","Emma"
"13798",158,"","Emma"
"13799",158,"“Him!—never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?”","Emma"
"13800",158,"turning away distressed.","Emma"
"13801",158,"","Emma"
"13802",158,"“Harriet!” cried Emma, after a moment’s pause—“What do you mean?—Good","Emma"
"13803",158,"Heaven! what do you mean?—Mistake you!—Am I to suppose then?—”","Emma"
"13804",158,"","Emma"
"13805",158,"She could not speak another word.—Her voice was lost; and she sat down,","Emma"
"13806",158,"waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.","Emma"
"13807",158,"","Emma"
"13808",158,"Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from","Emma"
"13809",158,"her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it was","Emma"
"13810",158,"in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma’s.","Emma"
"13811",158,"","Emma"
"13812",158,"“I should not have thought it possible,” she began, “that you could","Emma"
"13813",158,"have misunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him—but","Emma"
"13814",158,"considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else, I should","Emma"
"13815",158,"not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other","Emma"
"13816",158,"person. Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look","Emma"
"13817",158,"at him in the company of the other. I hope I have a better taste than","Emma"
"13818",158,"to think of Mr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side. And","Emma"
"13819",158,"that you should have been so mistaken, is amazing!—I am sure, but for","Emma"
"13820",158,"believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my","Emma"
"13821",158,"attachment, I should have considered it at first too great a","Emma"
"13822",158,"presumption almost, to dare to think of him. At first, if you had not","Emma"
"13823",158,"told me that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been","Emma"
"13824",158,"matches of greater disparity (those were your very words);—I should not","Emma"
"13825",158,"have dared to give way to—I should not have thought it possible—But if","Emma"
"13826",158,"_you_, who had been always acquainted with him—”","Emma"
"13827",158,"","Emma"
"13828",158,"“Harriet!” cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely—“Let us understand","Emma"
"13829",158,"each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. Are you","Emma"
"13830",158,"speaking of—Mr. Knightley?”","Emma"
"13831",158,"","Emma"
"13832",158,"“To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else—and so I","Emma"
"13833",158,"thought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as clear as","Emma"
"13834",158,"possible.”","Emma"
"13835",158,"","Emma"
"13836",158,"“Not quite,” returned Emma, with forced calmness, “for all that you","Emma"
"13837",158,"then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I could","Emma"
"13838",158,"almost assert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill. I am sure the","Emma"
"13839",158,"service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from","Emma"
"13840",158,"the gipsies, was spoken of.”","Emma"
"13841",158,"","Emma"
"13842",158,"“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!”","Emma"
"13843",158,"","Emma"
"13844",158,"“My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on","Emma"
"13845",158,"the occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment; that","Emma"
"13846",158,"considering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely","Emma"
"13847",158,"natural:—and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to","Emma"
"13848",158,"your sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations","Emma"
"13849",158,"had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.—The impression of","Emma"
"13850",158,"it is strong on my memory.”","Emma"
"13851",158,"","Emma"
"13852",158,"“Oh, dear,” cried Harriet, “now I recollect what you mean; but I was","Emma"
"13853",158,"thinking of something very different at the time. It was not the","Emma"
"13854",158,"gipsies—it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with some","Emma"
"13855",158,"elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance—of Mr.","Emma"
"13856",158,"Knightley’s coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not","Emma"
"13857",158,"stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. That","Emma"
"13858",158,"was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity;","Emma"
"13859",158,"that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to","Emma"
"13860",158,"every other being upon earth.”","Emma"
"13861",158,"","Emma"
"13862",158,"“Good God!” cried Emma, “this has been a most unfortunate—most","Emma"
"13863",158,"deplorable mistake!—What is to be done?”","Emma"
"13864",158,"","Emma"
"13865",158,"“You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? At","Emma"
"13866",158,"least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the","Emma"
"13867",158,"other had been the person; and now—it _is_ possible—”","Emma"
"13868",158,"","Emma"
"13869",158,"She paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.","Emma"
"13870",158,"","Emma"
"13871",158,"“I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,” she resumed, “that you should feel a","Emma"
"13872",158,"great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. You must","Emma"
"13873",158,"think one five hundred million times more above me than the other. But","Emma"
"13874",158,"I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing—that if—strange as it may","Emma"
"13875",158,"appear—. But you know they were your own words, that _more_ wonderful","Emma"
"13876",158,"things had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place","Emma"
"13877",158,"than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if","Emma"
"13878",158,"such a thing even as this, may have occurred before—and if I should be","Emma"
"13879",158,"so fortunate, beyond expression, as to—if Mr. Knightley should","Emma"
"13880",158,"really—if _he_ does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss","Emma"
"13881",158,"Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it, and try to put","Emma"
"13882",158,"difficulties in the way. But you are too good for that, I am sure.”","Emma"
"13883",158,"","Emma"
"13884",158,"Harriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to look","Emma"
"13885",158,"at her in consternation, and hastily said,","Emma"
"13886",158,"","Emma"
"13887",158,"“Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley’s returning your affection?”","Emma"
"13888",158,"","Emma"
"13889",158,"“Yes,” replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully—“I must say that I","Emma"
"13890",158,"have.”","Emma"
"13891",158,"","Emma"
"13892",158,"Emma’s eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,","Emma"
"13893",158,"in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient","Emma"
"13894",158,"for making her acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers, once","Emma"
"13895",158,"opening to suspicion, made rapid progress. She touched—she admitted—she","Emma"
"13896",158,"acknowledged the whole truth. Why was it so much worse that Harriet","Emma"
"13897",158,"should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank Churchill? Why","Emma"
"13898",158,"was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet’s having some hope of a","Emma"
"13899",158,"return? It darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr.","Emma"
"13900",158,"Knightley must marry no one but herself!","Emma"
"13901",158,"","Emma"
"13902",158,"Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same","Emma"
"13903",158,"few minutes. She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed","Emma"
"13904",158,"her before. How improperly had she been acting by Harriet! How","Emma"
"13905",158,"inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been","Emma"
"13906",158,"her conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her on! It struck","Emma"
"13907",158,"her with dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in","Emma"
"13908",158,"the world. Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of","Emma"
"13909",158,"all these demerits—some concern for her own appearance, and a strong","Emma"
"13910",158,"sense of justice by Harriet—(there would be no need of _compassion_ to","Emma"
"13911",158,"the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley—but justice","Emma"
"13912",158,"required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave","Emma"
"13913",158,"Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even","Emma"
"13914",158,"apparent kindness.—For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the","Emma"
"13915",158,"utmost extent of Harriet’s hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet","Emma"
"13916",158,"had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so","Emma"
"13917",158,"voluntarily formed and maintained—or to deserve to be slighted by the","Emma"
"13918",158,"person, whose counsels had never led her right.—Rousing from","Emma"
"13919",158,"reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet","Emma"
"13920",158,"again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as","Emma"
"13921",158,"to the subject which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of","Emma"
"13922",158,"Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.—Neither of them thought but","Emma"
"13923",158,"of Mr. Knightley and themselves.","Emma"
"13924",158,"","Emma"
"13925",158,"Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad","Emma"
"13926",158,"to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge,","Emma"
"13927",158,"and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to","Emma"
"13928",158,"give the history of her hopes with great, though trembling","Emma"
"13929",158,"delight.—Emma’s tremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were","Emma"
"13930",158,"better concealed than Harriet’s, but they were not less. Her voice was","Emma"
"13931",158,"not unsteady; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a","Emma"
"13932",158,"development of self, such a burst of threatening evil, such a confusion","Emma"
"13933",158,"of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.—She listened with much","Emma"
"13934",158,"inward suffering, but with great outward patience, to Harriet’s","Emma"
"13935",158,"detail.—Methodical, or well arranged, or very well delivered, it could","Emma"
"13936",158,"not be expected to be; but it contained, when separated from all the","Emma"
"13937",158,"feebleness and tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her","Emma"
"13938",158,"spirit—especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own","Emma"
"13939",158,"memory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley’s most improved opinion of","Emma"
"13940",158,"Harriet.","Emma"
"13941",158,"","Emma"
"13942",158,"Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since","Emma"
"13943",158,"those two decisive dances.—Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,","Emma"
"13944",158,"found her much superior to his expectation. From that evening, or at","Emma"
"13945",158,"least from the time of Miss Woodhouse’s encouraging her to think of","Emma"
"13946",158,"him, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more","Emma"
"13947",158,"than he had been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different","Emma"
"13948",158,"manner towards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness!—Latterly she","Emma"
"13949",158,"had been more and more aware of it. When they had been all walking","Emma"
"13950",158,"together, he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very","Emma"
"13951",158,"delightfully!—He seemed to want to be acquainted with her. Emma knew it","Emma"
"13952",158,"to have been very much the case. She had often observed the change, to","Emma"
"13953",158,"almost the same extent.—Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and","Emma"
"13954",158,"praise from him—and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with","Emma"
"13955",158,"what she had known of his opinion of Harriet. He praised her for being","Emma"
"13956",158,"without art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous,","Emma"
"13957",158,"feelings.—She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had","Emma"
"13958",158,"dwelt on them to her more than once.—Much that lived in Harriet’s","Emma"
"13959",158,"memory, many little particulars of the notice she had received from","Emma"
"13960",158,"him, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a","Emma"
"13961",158,"compliment implied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because","Emma"
"13962",158,"unsuspected, by Emma. Circumstances that might swell to half an hour’s","Emma"
"13963",158,"relation, and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had","Emma"
"13964",158,"passed undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest","Emma"
"13965",158,"occurrences to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet,","Emma"
"13966",158,"were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.—The first,","Emma"
"13967",158,"was his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at","Emma"
"13968",158,"Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came, and he","Emma"
"13969",158,"had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from the rest to","Emma"
"13970",158,"himself—and at first, he had talked to her in a more particular way","Emma"
"13971",158,"than he had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed!—(Harriet","Emma"
"13972",158,"could not recall it without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking","Emma"
"13973",158,"her, whether her affections were engaged.—But as soon as she (Miss","Emma"
"13974",158,"Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them, he changed the subject, and","Emma"
"13975",158,"began talking about farming:—The second, was his having sat talking","Emma"
"13976",158,"with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit, the","Emma"
"13977",158,"very last morning of his being at Hartfield—though, when he first came","Emma"
"13978",158,"in, he had said that he could not stay five minutes—and his having told","Emma"
"13979",158,"her, during their conversation, that though he must go to London, it","Emma"
"13980",158,"was very much against his inclination that he left home at all, which","Emma"
"13981",158,"was much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_. The","Emma"
"13982",158,"superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one article","Emma"
"13983",158,"marked, gave her severe pain.","Emma"
"13984",158,"","Emma"
"13985",158,"On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, after a","Emma"
"13986",158,"little reflection, venture the following question. “Might he not?—Is","Emma"
"13987",158,"not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of","Emma"
"13988",158,"your affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin—he might have Mr.","Emma"
"13989",158,"Martin’s interest in view? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with","Emma"
"13990",158,"spirit.","Emma"
"13991",158,"","Emma"
"13992",158,"“Mr. Martin! No indeed!—There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope I","Emma"
"13993",158,"know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of","Emma"
"13994",158,"it.”","Emma"
"13995",158,"","Emma"
"13996",158,"When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear Miss","Emma"
"13997",158,"Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.","Emma"
"13998",158,"","Emma"
"13999",158,"“I never should have presumed to think of it at first,” said she, “but","Emma"
"14000",158,"for you. You told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviour be","Emma"
"14001",158,"the rule of mine—and so I have. But now I seem to feel that I may","Emma"
"14002",158,"deserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing so","Emma"
"14003",158,"very wonderful.”","Emma"
"14004",158,"","Emma"
"14005",158,"The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter","Emma"
"14006",158,"feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma’s side, to enable","Emma"
"14007",158,"her to say on reply,","Emma"
"14008",158,"","Emma"
"14009",158,"“Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the","Emma"
"14010",158,"last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea","Emma"
"14011",158,"of his feeling for her more than he really does.”","Emma"
"14012",158,"","Emma"
"14013",158,"Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so","Emma"
"14014",158,"satisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which","Emma"
"14015",158,"at that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her","Emma"
"14016",158,"father’s footsteps. He was coming through the hall. Harriet was too","Emma"
"14017",158,"much agitated to encounter him. “She could not compose herself— Mr.","Emma"
"14018",158,"Woodhouse would be alarmed—she had better go;”—with most ready","Emma"
"14019",158,"encouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through","Emma"
"14020",158,"another door—and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous","Emma"
"14021",158,"burst of Emma’s feelings: “Oh God! that I had never seen her!”","Emma"
"14022",158,"","Emma"
"14023",158,"The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for her","Emma"
"14024",158,"thoughts.—She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had","Emma"
"14025",158,"rushed on her within the last few hours. Every moment had brought a","Emma"
"14026",158,"fresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to","Emma"
"14027",158,"her.—How to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions she had","Emma"
"14028",158,"been thus practising on herself, and living under!—The blunders, the","Emma"
"14029",158,"blindness of her own head and heart!—she sat still, she walked about,","Emma"
"14030",158,"she tried her own room, she tried the shrubbery—in every place, every","Emma"
"14031",158,"posture, she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had","Emma"
"14032",158,"been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had","Emma"
"14033",158,"been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was","Emma"
"14034",158,"wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of","Emma"
"14035",158,"wretchedness.","Emma"
"14036",158,"","Emma"
"14037",158,"To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the first","Emma"
"14038",158,"endeavour. To that point went every leisure moment which her father’s","Emma"
"14039",158,"claims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.","Emma"
"14040",158,"","Emma"
"14041",158,"How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling","Emma"
"14042",158,"declared him now to be? When had his influence, such influence begun?—","Emma"
"14043",158,"When had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank","Emma"
"14044",158,"Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?—She looked back; she","Emma"
"14045",158,"compared the two—compared them, as they had always stood in her","Emma"
"14046",158,"estimation, from the time of the latter’s becoming known to her—and as","Emma"
"14047",158,"they must at any time have been compared by her, had it—oh! had it, by","Emma"
"14048",158,"any blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute the comparison.—She","Emma"
"14049",158,"saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr.","Emma"
"14050",158,"Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when his regard for her had","Emma"
"14051",158,"not been infinitely the most dear. She saw, that in persuading herself,","Emma"
"14052",158,"in fancying, in acting to the contrary, she had been entirely under a","Emma"
"14053",158,"delusion, totally ignorant of her own heart—and, in short, that she had","Emma"
"14054",158,"never really cared for Frank Churchill at all!","Emma"
"14055",158,"","Emma"
"14056",158,"This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This was the","Emma"
"14057",158,"knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which she","Emma"
"14058",158,"reached; and without being long in reaching it.—She was most","Emma"
"14059",158,"sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed","Emma"
"14060",158,"to her—her affection for Mr. Knightley.—Every other part of her mind","Emma"
"14061",158,"was disgusting.","Emma"
"14062",158,"","Emma"
"14063",158,"With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of","Emma"
"14064",158,"every body’s feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange","Emma"
"14065",158,"every body’s destiny. She was proved to have been universally mistaken;","Emma"
"14066",158,"and she had not quite done nothing—for she had done mischief. She had","Emma"
"14067",158,"brought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared, on Mr.","Emma"
"14068",158,"Knightley.—Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place, on","Emma"
"14069",158,"her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for his","Emma"
"14070",158,"attachment, she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of","Emma"
"14071",158,"Harriet’s;—and even were this not the case, he would never have known","Emma"
"14072",158,"Harriet at all but for her folly.","Emma"
"14073",158,"","Emma"
"14074",158,"Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!—It was a union to distance every","Emma"
"14075",158,"wonder of the kind.—The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax","Emma"
"14076",158,"became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no","Emma"
"14077",158,"surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or","Emma"
"14078",158,"thought.—Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!—Such an elevation on her","Emma"
"14079",158,"side! Such a debasement on his! It was horrible to Emma to think how it","Emma"
"14080",158,"must sink him in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the","Emma"
"14081",158,"sneers, the merriment it would prompt at his expense; the mortification","Emma"
"14082",158,"and disdain of his brother, the thousand inconveniences to","Emma"
"14083",158,"himself.—Could it be?—No; it was impossible. And yet it was far, very","Emma"
"14084",158,"far, from impossible.—Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate","Emma"
"14085",158,"abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers? Was it new for one,","Emma"
"14086",158,"perhaps too busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would seek","Emma"
"14087",158,"him?—Was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal,","Emma"
"14088",158,"inconsistent, incongruous—or for chance and circumstance (as second","Emma"
"14089",158,"causes) to direct the human fate?","Emma"
"14090",158,"","Emma"
"14091",158,"Oh! had she never brought Harriet forward! Had she left her where she","Emma"
"14092",158,"ought, and where he had told her she ought!—Had she not, with a folly","Emma"
"14093",158,"which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying the","Emma"
"14094",158,"unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable","Emma"
"14095",158,"in the line of life to which she ought to belong—all would have been","Emma"
"14096",158,"safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.","Emma"
"14097",158,"","Emma"
"14098",158,"How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts","Emma"
"14099",158,"to Mr. Knightley!—How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of","Emma"
"14100",158,"such a man till actually assured of it!—But Harriet was less humble,","Emma"
"14101",158,"had fewer scruples than formerly.—Her inferiority, whether of mind or","Emma"
"14102",158,"situation, seemed little felt.—She had seemed more sensible of Mr.","Emma"
"14103",158,"Elton’s being to stoop in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr.","Emma"
"14104",158,"Knightley’s.—Alas! was not that her own doing too? Who had been at","Emma"
"14105",158,"pains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?—Who but","Emma"
"14106",158,"herself had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,","Emma"
"14107",158,"and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?—If","Emma"

"14113",158,"CHAPTER XII","Emma"
"14114",158,"","Emma"
"14115",158,"","Emma"
"14116",158,"Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known","Emma"
"14117",158,"how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,","Emma"
"14118",158,"first in interest and affection.—Satisfied that it was so, and feeling","Emma"
"14119",158,"it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the","Emma"
"14120",158,"dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had","Emma"
"14121",158,"been.—Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no","Emma"
"14122",158,"female connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims","Emma"
"14123",158,"could be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far","Emma"
"14124",158,"he loved and esteemed Isabella. She had herself been first with him for","Emma"
"14125",158,"many years past. She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent","Emma"
"14126",158,"or perverse, slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him,","Emma"
"14127",158,"insensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he","Emma"
"14128",158,"would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own—but","Emma"
"14129",158,"still, from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of","Emma"
"14130",158,"mind, he had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an","Emma"
"14131",158,"endeavour to improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no","Emma"
"14132",158,"other creature had at all shared. In spite of all her faults, she knew","Emma"
"14133",158,"she was dear to him; might she not say, very dear?—When the suggestions","Emma"
"14134",158,"of hope, however, which must follow here, presented themselves, she","Emma"
"14135",158,"could not presume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think herself","Emma"
"14136",158,"not unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by","Emma"
"14137",158,"Mr. Knightley. _She_ could not. She could not flatter herself with any","Emma"
"14138",158,"idea of blindness in his attachment to _her_. She had received a very","Emma"
"14139",158,"recent proof of its impartiality.—How shocked had he been by her","Emma"
"14140",158,"behaviour to Miss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he expressed","Emma"
"14141",158,"himself to her on the subject!—Not too strongly for the offence—but","Emma"
"14142",158,"far, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright","Emma"
"14143",158,"justice and clear-sighted goodwill.—She had no hope, nothing to deserve","Emma"
"14144",158,"the name of hope, that he could have that sort of affection for herself","Emma"
"14145",158,"which was now in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one,","Emma"
"14146",158,"at times much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and","Emma"
"14147",158,"be overrating his regard for _her_.—Wish it she must, for his sake—be","Emma"
"14148",158,"the consequence nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his","Emma"
"14149",158,"life. Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at","Emma"
"14150",158,"all, she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.—Let him but","Emma"
"14151",158,"continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr.","Emma"
"14152",158,"Knightley to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of","Emma"
"14153",158,"their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace","Emma"
"14154",158,"would be fully secured.—Marriage, in fact, would not do for her. It","Emma"
"14155",158,"would be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what","Emma"
"14156",158,"she felt for him. Nothing should separate her from her father. She","Emma"
"14157",158,"would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.","Emma"
"14158",158,"","Emma"
"14159",158,"It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she","Emma"
"14160",158,"hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at least be","Emma"
"14161",158,"able to ascertain what the chances for it were.—She should see them","Emma"
"14162",158,"henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she had","Emma"
"14163",158,"hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did not know","Emma"
"14164",158,"how to admit that she could be blinded here.—He was expected back every","Emma"
"14165",158,"day. The power of observation would be soon given—frightfully soon it","Emma"
"14166",158,"appeared when her thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, she","Emma"
"14167",158,"resolved against seeing Harriet.—It would do neither of them good, it","Emma"
"14168",158,"would do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther.—She was","Emma"
"14169",158,"resolved not to be convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet had","Emma"
"14170",158,"no authority for opposing Harriet’s confidence. To talk would be only","Emma"
"14171",158,"to irritate.—She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to","Emma"
"14172",158,"beg that she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it","Emma"
"14173",158,"to be her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of _one_","Emma"
"14174",158,"topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were","Emma"
"14175",158,"allowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of","Emma"
"14176",158,"others—she objected only to a tête-à-tête—they might be able to act as","Emma"
"14177",158,"if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.—Harriet submitted,","Emma"
"14178",158,"and approved, and was grateful.","Emma"
"14179",158,"","Emma"
"14180",158,"This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma’s","Emma"
"14181",158,"thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,","Emma"
"14182",158,"sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours—Mrs. Weston, who had","Emma"
"14183",158,"been calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her","Emma"
"14184",158,"way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to","Emma"
"14185",158,"relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.","Emma"
"14186",158,"","Emma"
"14187",158,"Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates’s, and gone through his","Emma"
"14188",158,"share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then","Emma"
"14189",158,"induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with","Emma"
"14190",158,"much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a","Emma"
"14191",158,"quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates’s parlour, with all the","Emma"
"14192",158,"encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.","Emma"
"14193",158,"","Emma"
"14194",158,"A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her","Emma"
"14195",158,"friend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal","Emma"
"14196",158,"of agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at","Emma"
"14197",158,"all at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead,","Emma"
"14198",158,"and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and","Emma"
"14199",158,"Mr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement’s becoming known;","Emma"
"14200",158,"as, considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid","Emma"
"14201",158,"without leading to reports:—but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he","Emma"
"14202",158,"was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her","Emma"
"14203",158,"family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it;","Emma"
"14204",158,"or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for “such things,”","Emma"
"14205",158,"he observed, “always got about.” Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston","Emma"
"14206",158,"had very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short—and very","Emma"
"14207",158,"great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. She had","Emma"
"14208",158,"hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn","Emma"
"14209",158,"how deeply she was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt","Emma"
"14210",158,"satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her","Emma"
"14211",158,"daughter—who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a","Emma"
"14212",158,"gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly","Emma"
"14213",158,"respectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation;","Emma"
"14214",158,"thought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of","Emma"
"14215",158,"themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss","Emma"
"14216",158,"Fairfax’s recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to","Emma"
"14217",158,"invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first, but,","Emma"
"14218",158,"on being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive, Mrs.","Emma"
"14219",158,"Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her","Emma"
"14220",158,"embarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject.","Emma"
"14221",158,"Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first","Emma"
"14222",158,"reception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always","Emma"
"14223",158,"feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the","Emma"
"14224",158,"cause; but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good","Emma"
"14225",158,"deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs.","Emma"
"14226",158,"Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief","Emma"
"14227",158,"to her companion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had so","Emma"
"14228",158,"long been, and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the","Emma"
"14229",158,"subject.","Emma"
"14230",158,"","Emma"
"14231",158,"“On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so","Emma"
"14232",158,"many months,” continued Mrs. Weston, “she was energetic. This was one","Emma"
"14233",158,"of her expressions. ‘I will not say, that since I entered into the","Emma"
"14234",158,"engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I","Emma"
"14235",158,"have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:’—and the quivering","Emma"
"14236",158,"lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my","Emma"
"14237",158,"heart.”","Emma"
"14238",158,"","Emma"
"14239",158,"“Poor girl!” said Emma. “She thinks herself wrong, then, for having","Emma"
"14240",158,"consented to a private engagement?”","Emma"
"14241",158,"","Emma"
"14242",158,"“Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed to","Emma"
"14243",158,"blame herself. ‘The consequence,’ said she, ‘has been a state of","Emma"
"14244",158,"perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the","Emma"
"14245",158,"punishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct.","Emma"
"14246",158,"Pain is no expiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting","Emma"
"14247",158,"contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every","Emma"
"14248",158,"thing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my","Emma"
"14249",158,"conscience tells me ought not to be.’ ‘Do not imagine, madam,’ she","Emma"
"14250",158,"continued, ‘that I was taught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on","Emma"
"14251",158,"the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up. The error","Emma"
"14252",158,"has been all my own; and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that","Emma"
"14253",158,"present circumstances may appear to give, I shall yet dread making the","Emma"
"14254",158,"story known to Colonel Campbell.’”","Emma"
"14255",158,"","Emma"
"14256",158,"“Poor girl!” said Emma again. “She loves him then excessively, I","Emma"
"14257",158,"suppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could be led","Emma"
"14258",158,"to form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered her","Emma"
"14259",158,"judgment.”","Emma"
"14260",158,"","Emma"
"14261",158,"“Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.”","Emma"
"14262",158,"","Emma"
"14263",158,"“I am afraid,” returned Emma, sighing, “that I must often have","Emma"
"14264",158,"contributed to make her unhappy.”","Emma"
"14265",158,"","Emma"
"14266",158,"“On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she probably","Emma"
"14267",158,"had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to the","Emma"
"14268",158,"misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One natural","Emma"
"14269",158,"consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,” she said, “was","Emma"
"14270",158,"that of making her _unreasonable_. The consciousness of having done","Emma"
"14271",158,"amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made her captious","Emma"
"14272",158,"and irritable to a degree that must have been—that had been—hard for","Emma"
"14273",158,"him to bear. ‘I did not make the allowances,’ said she, ‘which I ought","Emma"
"14274",158,"to have done, for his temper and spirits—his delightful spirits, and","Emma"
"14275",158,"that gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other","Emma"
"14276",158,"circumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to","Emma"
"14277",158,"me, as they were at first.’ She then began to speak of you, and of the","Emma"
"14278",158,"great kindness you had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush","Emma"
"14279",158,"which shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an","Emma"
"14280",158,"opportunity, to thank you—I could not thank you too much—for every wish","Emma"
"14281",158,"and every endeavour to do her good. She was sensible that you had never","Emma"
"14282",158,"received any proper acknowledgment from herself.”","Emma"
"14283",158,"","Emma"
"14284",158,"“If I did not know her to be happy now,” said Emma, seriously, “which,","Emma"
"14285",158,"in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience, she","Emma"
"14286",158,"must be, I could not bear these thanks;—for, oh! Mrs. Weston, if there","Emma"
"14287",158,"were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss","Emma"
"14288",158,"Fairfax!—Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this is","Emma"
"14289",158,"all to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interesting","Emma"
"14290",158,"particulars. They shew her to the greatest advantage. I am sure she is","Emma"
"14291",158,"very good—I hope she will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune","Emma"
"14292",158,"should be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.”","Emma"
"14293",158,"","Emma"
"14294",158,"Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She thought","Emma"
"14295",158,"well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved","Emma"
"14296",158,"him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. She talked with","Emma"
"14297",158,"a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection—but she had too","Emma"
"14298",158,"much to urge for Emma’s attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square","Emma"
"14299",158,"or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston","Emma"
"14300",158,"ended with, “We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you","Emma"
"14301",158,"know, but I hope it will soon come,” she was obliged to pause before","Emma"
"14302",158,"she answered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she could","Emma"
"14303",158,"at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for.","Emma"
"14304",158,"","Emma"
"14305",158,"“Are you well, my Emma?” was Mrs. Weston’s parting question.","Emma"
"14306",158,"","Emma"
"14307",158,"“Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me","Emma"

"14309",158,"","Emma"
"14310",158,"Mrs. Weston’s communications furnished Emma with more food for","Emma"
"14311",158,"unpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her","Emma"
"14312",158,"sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regretted","Emma"
"14313",158,"not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the","Emma"
"14314",158,"envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.","Emma"
"14315",158,"Had she followed Mr. Knightley’s known wishes, in paying that attention","Emma"
"14316",158,"to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know her","Emma"
"14317",158,"better; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured to","Emma"
"14318",158,"find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all","Emma"
"14319",158,"probability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her","Emma"
"14320",158,"now.—Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as","Emma"
"14321",158,"an associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and the other—what","Emma"
"14322",158,"was she?—Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends;","Emma"
"14323",158,"that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax’s confidence on this","Emma"
"14324",158,"important matter—which was most probable—still, in knowing her as she","Emma"
"14325",158,"ought, and as she might, she must have been preserved from the","Emma"
"14326",158,"abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she","Emma"
"14327",158,"had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so","Emma"
"14328",158,"unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a","Emma"
"14329",158,"subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane’s feelings, by the","Emma"
"14330",158,"levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill’s. Of all the sources of evil","Emma"
"14331",158,"surrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she was persuaded","Emma"
"14332",158,"that she must herself have been the worst. She must have been a","Emma"
"14333",158,"perpetual enemy. They never could have been all three together, without","Emma"
"14334",158,"her having stabbed Jane Fairfax’s peace in a thousand instances; and on","Emma"
"14335",158,"Box Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no","Emma"
"14336",158,"more.","Emma"
"14337",158,"","Emma"
"14338",158,"The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.","Emma"
"14339",158,"The weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in,","Emma"
"14340",158,"and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the","Emma"
"14341",158,"wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such","Emma"
"14342",158,"cruel sights the longer visible.","Emma"
"14343",158,"","Emma"
"14344",158,"The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably","Emma"
"14345",158,"comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter’s side, and","Emma"
"14346",158,"by exertions which had never cost her half so much before. It reminded","Emma"
"14347",158,"her of their first forlorn tête-à-tête, on the evening of Mrs. Weston’s","Emma"
"14348",158,"wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea, and","Emma"
"14349",158,"dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of","Emma"
"14350",158,"Hartfield’s attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly","Emma"
"14351",158,"be over. The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the","Emma"
"14352",158,"approaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them,","Emma"
"14353",158,"no pleasures had been lost.—But her present forebodings she feared","Emma"
"14354",158,"would experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her now,","Emma"
"14355",158,"was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled—that","Emma"
"14356",158,"might not be even partially brightened. If all took place that might","Emma"
"14357",158,"take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must be","Emma"
"14358",158,"comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the","Emma"
"14359",158,"spirits only of ruined happiness.","Emma"
"14360",158,"","Emma"
"14361",158,"The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than","Emma"
"14362",158,"herself; and Mrs. Weston’s heart and time would be occupied by it. They","Emma"
"14363",158,"should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband","Emma"
"14364",158,"also.—Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss","Emma"
"14365",158,"Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to","Emma"
"14366",158,"Highbury. They would be married, and settled either at or near","Emma"
"14367",158,"Enscombe. All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these","Emma"
"14368",158,"losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of","Emma"
"14369",158,"cheerful or of rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to be","Emma"
"14370",158,"no longer coming there for his evening comfort!—No longer walking in at","Emma"
"14371",158,"all hours, as if ever willing to change his own home for their’s!—How","Emma"
"14372",158,"was it to be endured? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet’s","Emma"
"14373",158,"sake; if he were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet’s","Emma"
"14374",158,"society all that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the","Emma"
"14375",158,"first, the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked for all the","Emma"
"14376",158,"best blessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma’s","Emma"
"14377",158,"wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind, that","Emma"
"14378",158,"it had been all her own work?","Emma"
"14379",158,"","Emma"
"14380",158,"When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain from","Emma"
"14381",158,"a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a few","Emma"
"14382",158,"seconds—and the only source whence any thing like consolation or","Emma"
"14383",158,"composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better","Emma"
"14384",158,"conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might","Emma"
"14385",158,"be the following and every future winter of her life to the past, it","Emma"
"14386",158,"would yet find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, and","Emma"
"14387",158,"leave her less to regret when it were gone.","Emma"

"14392",158,"CHAPTER XIII","Emma"
"14393",158,"","Emma"
"14394",158,"","Emma"
"14395",158,"The weather continued much the same all the following morning; and the","Emma"
"14396",158,"same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at","Emma"
"14397",158,"Hartfield—but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a","Emma"
"14398",158,"softer quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was","Emma"
"14399",158,"summer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition gives,","Emma"
"14400",158,"Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had the","Emma"
"14401",158,"exquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and","Emma"
"14402",158,"brilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her. She longed for","Emma"
"14403",158,"the serenity they might gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry’s coming","Emma"
"14404",158,"in soon after dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, she","Emma"
"14405",158,"lost no time in hurrying into the shrubbery.—There, with spirits","Emma"
"14406",158,"freshened, and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns,","Emma"
"14407",158,"when she saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming","Emma"
"14408",158,"towards her.—It was the first intimation of his being returned from","Emma"
"14409",158,"London. She had been thinking of him the moment before, as","Emma"
"14410",158,"unquestionably sixteen miles distant.—There was time only for the","Emma"
"14411",158,"quickest arrangement of mind. She must be collected and calm. In half a","Emma"
"14412",158,"minute they were together. The “How d’ye do’s” were quiet and","Emma"
"14413",158,"constrained on each side. She asked after their mutual friends; they","Emma"
"14414",158,"were all well.—When had he left them?—Only that morning. He must have","Emma"
"14415",158,"had a wet ride.—Yes.—He meant to walk with her, she found. “He had just","Emma"
"14416",158,"looked into the dining-room, and as he was not wanted there, preferred","Emma"
"14417",158,"being out of doors.”—She thought he neither looked nor spoke","Emma"
"14418",158,"cheerfully; and the first possible cause for it, suggested by her","Emma"
"14419",158,"fears, was, that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his","Emma"
"14420",158,"brother, and was pained by the manner in which they had been received.","Emma"
"14421",158,"","Emma"
"14422",158,"They walked together. He was silent. She thought he was often looking","Emma"
"14423",158,"at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to","Emma"
"14424",158,"give. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wanted to","Emma"
"14425",158,"speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching for","Emma"
"14426",158,"encouragement to begin.—She did not, could not, feel equal to lead the","Emma"
"14427",158,"way to any such subject. He must do it all himself. Yet she could not","Emma"
"14428",158,"bear this silence. With him it was most unnatural. She","Emma"
"14429",158,"considered—resolved—and, trying to smile, began—","Emma"
"14430",158,"","Emma"
"14431",158,"“You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather","Emma"
"14432",158,"surprize you.”","Emma"
"14433",158,"","Emma"
"14434",158,"“Have I?” said he quietly, and looking at her; “of what nature?”","Emma"
"14435",158,"","Emma"
"14436",158,"“Oh! the best nature in the world—a wedding.”","Emma"
"14437",158,"","Emma"
"14438",158,"After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more,","Emma"
"14439",158,"he replied,","Emma"
"14440",158,"","Emma"
"14441",158,"“If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that","Emma"
"14442",158,"already.”","Emma"
"14443",158,"","Emma"
"14444",158,"“How is it possible?” cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks towards","Emma"
"14445",158,"him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called","Emma"
"14446",158,"at Mrs. Goddard’s in his way.","Emma"
"14447",158,"","Emma"
"14448",158,"“I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and","Emma"
"14449",158,"at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.”","Emma"
"14450",158,"","Emma"
"14451",158,"Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more","Emma"
"14452",158,"composure,","Emma"
"14453",158,"","Emma"
"14454",158,"“_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have","Emma"
"14455",158,"had your suspicions.—I have not forgotten that you once tried to give","Emma"
"14456",158,"me a caution.—I wish I had attended to it—but—(with a sinking voice and","Emma"
"14457",158,"a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.”","Emma"
"14458",158,"","Emma"
"14459",158,"For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of","Emma"
"14460",158,"having excited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawn","Emma"
"14461",158,"within his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying,","Emma"
"14462",158,"in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,","Emma"
"14463",158,"","Emma"
"14464",158,"“Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.—Your own excellent","Emma"
"14465",158,"sense—your exertions for your father’s sake—I know you will not allow","Emma"
"14466",158,"yourself—.” Her arm was pressed again, as he added, in a more broken","Emma"
"14467",158,"and subdued accent, “The feelings of the warmest","Emma"
"14468",158,"friendship—Indignation—Abominable scoundrel!”—And in a louder, steadier","Emma"
"14469",158,"tone, he concluded with, “He will soon be gone. They will soon be in","Emma"
"14470",158,"Yorkshire. I am sorry for _her_. She deserves a better fate.”","Emma"
"14471",158,"","Emma"
"14472",158,"Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter","Emma"
"14473",158,"of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,","Emma"
"14474",158,"","Emma"
"14475",158,"“You are very kind—but you are mistaken—and I must set you right.— I am","Emma"
"14476",158,"not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness to what was going","Emma"
"14477",158,"on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of,","Emma"
"14478",158,"and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may","Emma"
"14479",158,"well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reason","Emma"
"14480",158,"to regret that I was not in the secret earlier.”","Emma"
"14481",158,"","Emma"
"14482",158,"“Emma!” cried he, looking eagerly at her, “are you, indeed?”—but","Emma"
"14483",158,"checking himself—“No, no, I understand you—forgive me—I am pleased that","Emma"
"14484",158,"you can say even so much.—He is no object of regret, indeed! and it","Emma"
"14485",158,"will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment","Emma"
"14486",158,"of more than your reason.—Fortunate that your affections were not","Emma"
"14487",158,"farther entangled!—I could never, I confess, from your manners, assure","Emma"
"14488",158,"myself as to the degree of what you felt—I could only be certain that","Emma"
"14489",158,"there was a preference—and a preference which I never believed him to","Emma"
"14490",158,"deserve.—He is a disgrace to the name of man.—And is he to be rewarded","Emma"
"14491",158,"with that sweet young woman?—Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable","Emma"
"14492",158,"creature.”","Emma"
"14493",158,"","Emma"
"14494",158,"“Mr. Knightley,” said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused—“I","Emma"
"14495",158,"am in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you continue in your","Emma"
"14496",158,"error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I","Emma"
"14497",158,"have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been","Emma"
"14498",158,"at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be","Emma"
"14499",158,"natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.—But I","Emma"
"14500",158,"never have.”","Emma"
"14501",158,"","Emma"
"14502",158,"He listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but he would","Emma"
"14503",158,"not. She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his","Emma"
"14504",158,"clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself","Emma"
"14505",158,"in his opinion. She went on, however.","Emma"
"14506",158,"","Emma"
"14507",158,"“I have very little to say for my own conduct.—I was tempted by his","Emma"
"14508",158,"attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.—An old story,","Emma"
"14509",158,"probably—a common case—and no more than has happened to hundreds of my","Emma"
"14510",158,"sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up","Emma"
"14511",158,"as I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the temptation.","Emma"
"14512",158,"He was the son of Mr. Weston—he was continually here—I always found him","Emma"
"14513",158,"very pleasant—and, in short, for (with a sigh) let me swell out the","Emma"
"14514",158,"causes ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last—my vanity","Emma"
"14515",158,"was flattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly, however—for some","Emma"
"14516",158,"time, indeed—I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.—I thought","Emma"
"14517",158,"them a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.","Emma"
"14518",158,"He has imposed on me, but he has not injured me. I have never been","Emma"
"14519",158,"attached to him. And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour. He","Emma"
"14520",158,"never wished to attach me. It was merely a blind to conceal his real","Emma"
"14521",158,"situation with another.—It was his object to blind all about him; and","Emma"
"14522",158,"no one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myself—except","Emma"
"14523",158,"that I was _not_ blinded—that it was my good fortune—that, in short, I","Emma"
"14524",158,"was somehow or other safe from him.”","Emma"
"14525",158,"","Emma"
"14526",158,"She had hoped for an answer here—for a few words to say that her","Emma"
"14527",158,"conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as","Emma"
"14528",158,"she could judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usual","Emma"
"14529",158,"tone, he said,","Emma"
"14530",158,"","Emma"
"14531",158,"“I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.—I can suppose,","Emma"
"14532",158,"however, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance with him has","Emma"
"14533",158,"been but trifling.—And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, he","Emma"
"14534",158,"may yet turn out well.—With such a woman he has a chance.—I have no","Emma"
"14535",158,"motive for wishing him ill—and for her sake, whose happiness will be","Emma"
"14536",158,"involved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him","Emma"
"14537",158,"well.”","Emma"
"14538",158,"","Emma"
"14539",158,"“I have no doubt of their being happy together,” said Emma; “I believe","Emma"
"14540",158,"them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.”","Emma"
"14541",158,"","Emma"
"14542",158,"“He is a most fortunate man!” returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. “So","Emma"
"14543",158,"early in life—at three-and-twenty—a period when, if a man chuses a","Emma"
"14544",158,"wife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn such a","Emma"
"14545",158,"prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation, has","Emma"
"14546",158,"before him!—Assured of the love of such a woman—the disinterested love,","Emma"
"14547",158,"for Jane Fairfax’s character vouches for her disinterestedness; every","Emma"
"14548",158,"thing in his favour,—equality of situation—I mean, as far as regards","Emma"
"14549",158,"society, and all the habits and manners that are important; equality in","Emma"
"14550",158,"every point but one—and that one, since the purity of her heart is not","Emma"
"14551",158,"to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his","Emma"
"14552",158,"to bestow the only advantages she wants.—A man would always wish to","Emma"
"14553",158,"give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who","Emma"
"14554",158,"can do it, where there is no doubt of _her_ regard, must, I think, be","Emma"
"14555",158,"the happiest of mortals.—Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of","Emma"
"14556",158,"fortune. Every thing turns out for his good.—He meets with a young","Emma"
"14557",158,"woman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her","Emma"
"14558",158,"by negligent treatment—and had he and all his family sought round the","Emma"
"14559",158,"world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found her","Emma"
"14560",158,"superior.—His aunt is in the way.—His aunt dies.—He has only to","Emma"
"14561",158,"speak.—His friends are eager to promote his happiness.—He had used","Emma"
"14562",158,"every body ill—and they are all delighted to forgive him.—He is a","Emma"
"14563",158,"fortunate man indeed!”","Emma"
"14564",158,"","Emma"
"14565",158,"“You speak as if you envied him.”","Emma"
"14566",158,"","Emma"
"14567",158,"“And I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my envy.”","Emma"
"14568",158,"","Emma"
"14569",158,"Emma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence of","Emma"
"14570",158,"Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if","Emma"
"14571",158,"possible. She made her plan; she would speak of something totally","Emma"
"14572",158,"different—the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for","Emma"
"14573",158,"breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,","Emma"
"14574",158,"","Emma"
"14575",158,"“You will not ask me what is the point of envy.—You are determined, I","Emma"
"14576",158,"see, to have no curiosity.—You are wise—but _I_ cannot be wise. Emma, I","Emma"
"14577",158,"must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the","Emma"
"14578",158,"next moment.”","Emma"
"14579",158,"","Emma"
"14580",158,"“Oh! then, don’t speak it, don’t speak it,” she eagerly cried. “Take a","Emma"
"14581",158,"little time, consider, do not commit yourself.”","Emma"
"14582",158,"","Emma"
"14583",158,"“Thank you,” said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not","Emma"
"14584",158,"another syllable followed.","Emma"
"14585",158,"","Emma"
"14586",158,"Emma could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide in","Emma"
"14587",158,"her—perhaps to consult her;—cost her what it would, she would listen.","Emma"
"14588",158,"She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might give","Emma"
"14589",158,"just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his own","Emma"
"14590",158,"independence, relieve him from that state of indecision, which must be","Emma"
"14591",158,"more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.—They had","Emma"
"14592",158,"reached the house.","Emma"
"14593",158,"","Emma"
"14594",158,"“You are going in, I suppose?” said he.","Emma"
"14595",158,"","Emma"
"14596",158,"“No,”—replied Emma—quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he","Emma"
"14597",158,"still spoke—“I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry is not","Emma"
"14598",158,"gone.” And, after proceeding a few steps, she added—“I stopped you","Emma"
"14599",158,"ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you","Emma"
"14600",158,"pain.—But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or to","Emma"
"14601",158,"ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation—as a","Emma"
"14602",158,"friend, indeed, you may command me.—I will hear whatever you like. I","Emma"
"14603",158,"will tell you exactly what I think.”","Emma"
"14604",158,"","Emma"
"14605",158,"“As a friend!”—repeated Mr. Knightley.—“Emma, that I fear is a word—No,","Emma"
"14606",158,"I have no wish—Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?—I have gone too far","Emma"
"14607",158,"already for concealment.—Emma, I accept your offer—Extraordinary as it","Emma"
"14608",158,"may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you as a friend.—Tell me,","Emma"
"14609",158,"then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?”","Emma"
"14610",158,"","Emma"
"14611",158,"He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression","Emma"
"14612",158,"of his eyes overpowered her.","Emma"
"14613",158,"","Emma"
"14614",158,"“My dearest Emma,” said he, “for dearest you will always be, whatever","Emma"
"14615",158,"the event of this hour’s conversation, my dearest, most beloved","Emma"
"14616",158,"Emma—tell me at once. Say ‘No,’ if it is to be said.”—She could really","Emma"
"14617",158,"say nothing.—“You are silent,” he cried, with great animation;","Emma"
"14618",158,"“absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.”","Emma"
"14619",158,"","Emma"
"14620",158,"Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The","Emma"
"14621",158,"dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most","Emma"
"14622",158,"prominent feeling.","Emma"
"14623",158,"","Emma"
"14624",158,"“I cannot make speeches, Emma:” he soon resumed; and in a tone of such","Emma"
"14625",158,"sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably","Emma"
"14626",158,"convincing.—“If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it","Emma"
"14627",158,"more. But you know what I am.—You hear nothing but truth from me.—I","Emma"
"14628",158,"have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other","Emma"
"14629",158,"woman in England would have borne it.—Bear with the truths I would tell","Emma"
"14630",158,"you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The manner,","Emma"
"14631",158,"perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have been a","Emma"
"14632",158,"very indifferent lover.—But you understand me.—Yes, you see, you","Emma"
"14633",158,"understand my feelings—and will return them if you can. At present, I","Emma"
"14634",158,"ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.”","Emma"
"14635",158,"","Emma"
"14636",158,"While he spoke, Emma’s mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful","Emma"
"14637",158,"velocity of thought, had been able—and yet without losing a word—to","Emma"
"14638",158,"catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that","Emma"
"14639",158,"Harriet’s hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as","Emma"
"14640",158,"complete a delusion as any of her own—that Harriet was nothing; that","Emma"
"14641",158,"she was every thing herself; that what she had been saying relative to","Emma"
"14642",158,"Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and","Emma"
"14643",158,"that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had","Emma"
"14644",158,"been all received as discouragement from herself.—And not only was","Emma"
"14645",158,"there time for these convictions, with all their glow of attendant","Emma"
"14646",158,"happiness; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet’s secret had not","Emma"
"14647",158,"escaped her, and to resolve that it need not, and should not.—It was","Emma"
"14648",158,"all the service she could now render her poor friend; for as to any of","Emma"
"14649",158,"that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him","Emma"
"14650",158,"to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the","Emma"
"14651",158,"most worthy of the two—or even the more simple sublimity of resolving","Emma"
"14652",158,"to refuse him at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive,","Emma"
"14653",158,"because he could not marry them both, Emma had it not. She felt for","Emma"
"14654",158,"Harriet, with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run","Emma"
"14655",158,"mad, opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her","Emma"
"14656",158,"brain. She had led her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to her","Emma"
"14657",158,"for ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings, and as strong","Emma"
"14658",158,"as it had ever been before, in reprobating any such alliance for him,","Emma"
"14659",158,"as most unequal and degrading. Her way was clear, though not quite","Emma"
"14660",158,"smooth.—She spoke then, on being so entreated.—What did she say?—Just","Emma"
"14661",158,"what she ought, of course. A lady always does.—She said enough to shew","Emma"
"14662",158,"there need not be despair—and to invite him to say more himself. He","Emma"
"14663",158,"_had_ despaired at one period; he had received such an injunction to","Emma"
"14664",158,"caution and silence, as for the time crushed every hope;—she had begun","Emma"
"14665",158,"by refusing to hear him.—The change had perhaps been somewhat","Emma"
"14666",158,"sudden;—her proposal of taking another turn, her renewing the","Emma"
"14667",158,"conversation which she had just put an end to, might be a little","Emma"
"14668",158,"extraordinary!—She felt its inconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so","Emma"
"14669",158,"obliging as to put up with it, and seek no farther explanation.","Emma"
"14670",158,"","Emma"
"14671",158,"Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human","Emma"
"14672",158,"disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little","Emma"
"14673",158,"disguised, or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the","Emma"
"14674",158,"conduct is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very","Emma"
"14675",158,"material.—Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart","Emma"
"14676",158,"than she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.","Emma"
"14677",158,"","Emma"
"14678",158,"He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. He had","Emma"
"14679",158,"followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He had come,","Emma"
"14680",158,"in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill’s engagement, with","Emma"
"14681",158,"no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed","Emma"
"14682",158,"him an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.—The rest had been the work","Emma"
"14683",158,"of the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings.","Emma"
"14684",158,"The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank","Emma"
"14685",158,"Churchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had","Emma"
"14686",158,"given birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection","Emma"
"14687",158,"himself;—but it had been no present hope—he had only, in the momentary","Emma"
"14688",158,"conquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did","Emma"
"14689",158,"not forbid his attempt to attach her.—The superior hopes which","Emma"
"14690",158,"gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.—The affection, which","Emma"
"14691",158,"he had been asking to be allowed to create, if he could, was already","Emma"
"14692",158,"his!—Within half an hour, he had passed from a thoroughly distressed","Emma"
"14693",158,"state of mind, to something so like perfect happiness, that it could","Emma"
"14694",158,"bear no other name.","Emma"
"14695",158,"","Emma"
"14696",158,"_Her_ change was equal.—This one half-hour had given to each the same","Emma"
"14697",158,"precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same","Emma"
"14698",158,"degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.—On his side, there had been","Emma"
"14699",158,"a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation,","Emma"
"14700",158,"of Frank Churchill.—He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank","Emma"
"14701",158,"Churchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably","Emma"
"14702",158,"enlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill","Emma"
"14703",158,"that had taken him from the country.—The Box Hill party had decided him","Emma"
"14704",158,"on going away. He would save himself from witnessing again such","Emma"
"14705",158,"permitted, encouraged attentions.—He had gone to learn to be","Emma"
"14706",158,"indifferent.—But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too much","Emma"
"14707",158,"domestic happiness in his brother’s house; woman wore too amiable a","Emma"
"14708",158,"form in it; Isabella was too much like Emma—differing only in those","Emma"
"14709",158,"striking inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy","Emma"
"14710",158,"before him, for much to have been done, even had his time been","Emma"
"14711",158,"longer.—He had stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day—till this","Emma"
"14712",158,"very morning’s post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.—Then,","Emma"
"14713",158,"with the gladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to","Emma"
"14714",158,"feel, having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving","Emma"
"14715",158,"Emma, was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her,","Emma"
"14716",158,"that he could stay no longer. He had ridden home through the rain; and","Emma"
"14717",158,"had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest and best","Emma"
"14718",158,"of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults, bore the","Emma"
"14719",158,"discovery.","Emma"
"14720",158,"","Emma"
"14721",158,"He had found her agitated and low.—Frank Churchill was a villain.— He","Emma"
"14722",158,"heard her declare that she had never loved him. Frank Churchill’s","Emma"
"14723",158,"character was not desperate.—She was his own Emma, by hand and word,","Emma"
"14724",158,"when they returned into the house; and if he could have thought of","Emma"
"14725",158,"Frank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort of","Emma"

"14731",158,"CHAPTER XIV","Emma"
"14732",158,"","Emma"
"14733",158,"","Emma"
"14734",158,"What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from","Emma"
"14735",158,"what she had brought out!—she had then been only daring to hope for a","Emma"
"14736",158,"little respite of suffering;—she was now in an exquisite flutter of","Emma"
"14737",158,"happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be","Emma"
"14738",158,"greater when the flutter should have passed away.","Emma"
"14739",158,"","Emma"
"14740",158,"They sat down to tea—the same party round the same table—how often it","Emma"
"14741",158,"had been collected!—and how often had her eyes fallen on the same","Emma"
"14742",158,"shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the","Emma"
"14743",158,"western sun!—But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing","Emma"
"14744",158,"like it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her","Emma"
"14745",158,"usual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive","Emma"
"14746",158,"daughter.","Emma"
"14747",158,"","Emma"
"14748",158,"Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in","Emma"
"14749",158,"the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so","Emma"
"14750",158,"anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.—Could he have","Emma"
"14751",158,"seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but","Emma"
"14752",158,"without the most distant imagination of the impending evil, without the","Emma"
"14753",158,"slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of","Emma"
"14754",158,"either, he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news","Emma"
"14755",158,"he had received from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much","Emma"
"14756",158,"self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him","Emma"
"14757",158,"in return.","Emma"
"14758",158,"","Emma"
"14759",158,"As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma’s fever continued;","Emma"
"14760",158,"but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and","Emma"
"14761",158,"subdued—and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax for","Emma"
"14762",158,"such an evening, she found one or two such very serious points to","Emma"
"14763",158,"consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have some","Emma"
"14764",158,"alloy. Her father—and Harriet. She could not be alone without feeling","Emma"
"14765",158,"the full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort","Emma"
"14766",158,"of both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her father, it","Emma"
"14767",158,"was a question soon answered. She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley","Emma"
"14768",158,"would ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most","Emma"
"14769",158,"solemn resolution of never quitting her father.—She even wept over the","Emma"
"14770",158,"idea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be only an","Emma"
"14771",158,"engagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger","Emma"
"14772",158,"of drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.—How","Emma"
"14773",158,"to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;—how to spare","Emma"
"14774",158,"her from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement;","Emma"
"14775",158,"how to appear least her enemy?—On these subjects, her perplexity and","Emma"
"14776",158,"distress were very great—and her mind had to pass again and again","Emma"
"14777",158,"through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever","Emma"
"14778",158,"surrounded it.—She could only resolve at last, that she would still","Emma"
"14779",158,"avoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by","Emma"
"14780",158,"letter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed","Emma"
"14781",158,"just now for a time from Highbury, and—indulging in one scheme","Emma"
"14782",158,"more—nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation","Emma"
"14783",158,"for her to Brunswick Square.—Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;","Emma"
"14784",158,"and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.—She did","Emma"
"14785",158,"not think it in Harriet’s nature to escape being benefited by novelty","Emma"
"14786",158,"and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.—At any rate,","Emma"
"14787",158,"it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom","Emma"
"14788",158,"every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the","Emma"
"14789",158,"evil day, when they must all be together again.","Emma"
"14790",158,"","Emma"
"14791",158,"She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment which","Emma"
"14792",158,"left her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking","Emma"
"14793",158,"up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and half","Emma"
"14794",158,"an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him,","Emma"
"14795",158,"literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in a","Emma"
"14796",158,"proper share of the happiness of the evening before.","Emma"
"14797",158,"","Emma"
"14798",158,"He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have the","Emma"
"14799",158,"slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was","Emma"
"14800",158,"brought her from Randalls—a very thick letter;—she guessed what it must","Emma"
"14801",158,"contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.—She was now in","Emma"
"14802",158,"perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted no explanations, she","Emma"
"14803",158,"wanted only to have her thoughts to herself—and as for understanding","Emma"
"14804",158,"any thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable of it.—It must be","Emma"
"14805",158,"waded through, however. She opened the packet; it was too surely so;—a","Emma"
"14806",158,"note from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in the letter from Frank to","Emma"
"14807",158,"Mrs. Weston.","Emma"
"14808",158,"","Emma"
"14809",158,"“I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you the","Emma"
"14810",158,"enclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have","Emma"
"14811",158,"scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.—I think we shall never materially","Emma"
"14812",158,"disagree about the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long","Emma"
"14813",158,"preface.—We are quite well.—This letter has been the cure of all the","Emma"
"14814",158,"little nervousness I have been feeling lately.—I did not quite like","Emma"
"14815",158,"your looks on Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and though you","Emma"
"14816",158,"will never own being affected by weather, I think every body feels a","Emma"
"14817",158,"north-east wind.—I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of","Emma"
"14818",158,"Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing","Emma"
"14819",158,"last night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.","Emma"

"14832",158,"","Emma"
"14833",158,"","Emma"
"14834",158,"“If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected;","Emma"
"14835",158,"but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and","Emma"
"14836",158,"indulgence.—You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of","Emma"
"14837",158,"even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.—But","Emma"
"14838",158,"I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent. My courage","Emma"
"14839",158,"rises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous to be","Emma"
"14840",158,"humble. I have already met with such success in two applications for","Emma"
"14841",158,"pardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours,","Emma"
"14842",158,"and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.—You","Emma"
"14843",158,"must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when","Emma"
"14844",158,"I first arrived at Randalls; you must consider me as having a secret","Emma"
"14845",158,"which was to be kept at all hazards. This was the fact. My right to","Emma"
"14846",158,"place myself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another","Emma"
"14847",158,"question. I shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to _think_ it","Emma"
"14848",158,"a right, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below,","Emma"
"14849",158,"and casements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her openly; my","Emma"
"14850",158,"difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to","Emma"
"14851",158,"require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we","Emma"
"14852",158,"parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in the","Emma"
"14853",158,"creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.—Had she refused, I","Emma"
"14854",158,"should have gone mad.—But you will be ready to say, what was your hope","Emma"
"14855",158,"in doing this?—What did you look forward to?—To any thing, every","Emma"
"14856",158,"thing—to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts,","Emma"
"14857",158,"perseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Every possibility of","Emma"
"14858",158,"good was before me, and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining","Emma"
"14859",158,"her promises of faith and correspondence. If you need farther","Emma"
"14860",158,"explanation, I have the honour, my dear madam, of being your husband’s","Emma"
"14861",158,"son, and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good,","Emma"
"14862",158,"which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value","Emma"
"14863",158,"of.—See me, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit","Emma"
"14864",158,"to Randalls;—and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might","Emma"
"14865",158,"have been sooner paid. You will look back and see that I did not come","Emma"
"14866",158,"till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as _you_ were the person","Emma"
"14867",158,"slighted, you will forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father’s","Emma"
"14868",158,"compassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from","Emma"
"14869",158,"his house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you. My behaviour,","Emma"
"14870",158,"during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, I","Emma"
"14871",158,"hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point. And now I","Emma"
"14872",158,"come to the principal, the only important part of my conduct while","Emma"
"14873",158,"belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or requires very","Emma"
"14874",158,"solicitous explanation. With the greatest respect, and the warmest","Emma"
"14875",158,"friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I","Emma"
"14876",158,"ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.—A few words which dropped","Emma"
"14877",158,"from him yesterday spoke his opinion, and some censure I acknowledge","Emma"
"14878",158,"myself liable to.—My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe,","Emma"
"14879",158,"more than it ought.—In order to assist a concealment so essential to","Emma"
"14880",158,"me, I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of","Emma"
"14881",158,"intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.—I cannot deny that Miss","Emma"
"14882",158,"Woodhouse was my ostensible object—but I am sure you will believe the","Emma"
"14883",158,"declaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference, I would","Emma"
"14884",158,"not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.—Amiable and","Emma"
"14885",158,"delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me the idea of a young","Emma"
"14886",158,"woman likely to be attached; and that she was perfectly free from any","Emma"
"14887",158,"tendency to being attached to me, was as much my conviction as my","Emma"
"14888",158,"wish.—She received my attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured","Emma"
"14889",158,"playfulness, which exactly suited me. We seemed to understand each","Emma"
"14890",158,"other. From our relative situation, those attentions were her due, and","Emma"
"14891",158,"were felt to be so.—Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand","Emma"
"14892",158,"me before the expiration of that fortnight, I cannot say;—when I called","Emma"
"14893",158,"to take leave of her, I remember that I was within a moment of","Emma"
"14894",158,"confessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not without suspicion;","Emma"
"14895",158,"but I have no doubt of her having since detected me, at least in some","Emma"
"14896",158,"degree.—She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must","Emma"
"14897",158,"have penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find, whenever the","Emma"
"14898",158,"subject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it did not take","Emma"
"14899",158,"her wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it. I remember","Emma"
"14900",158,"her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her","Emma"
"14901",158,"attentions to Miss Fairfax.—I hope this history of my conduct towards","Emma"
"14902",158,"her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what","Emma"
"14903",158,"you saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against Emma","Emma"
"14904",158,"Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, and","Emma"
"14905",158,"procure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of","Emma"
"14906",158,"that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly","Emma"
"14907",158,"affection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as","Emma"
"14908",158,"myself.—Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,","Emma"
"14909",158,"you have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to","Emma"
"14910",158,"get my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.","Emma"
"14911",158,"If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.—Of","Emma"
"14912",158,"the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that","Emma"
"14913",158,"its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F—, who would never","Emma"
"14914",158,"have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.—The delicacy","Emma"
"14915",158,"of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam, is much","Emma"
"14916",158,"beyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly hope,","Emma"
"14917",158,"know her thoroughly yourself.—No description can describe her. She must","Emma"
"14918",158,"tell you herself what she is—yet not by word, for never was there a","Emma"
"14919",158,"human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.—Since I","Emma"
"14920",158,"began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard","Emma"
"14921",158,"from her.—She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never","Emma"
"14922",158,"complains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion of her looks.","Emma"
"14923",158,"I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit.","Emma"
"14924",158,"Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you without delay; I am","Emma"
"14925",158,"impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how few minutes I was at","Emma"
"14926",158,"Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and I am not much","Emma"
"14927",158,"better yet; still insane either from happiness or misery. When I think","Emma"
"14928",158,"of the kindness and favour I have met with, of her excellence and","Emma"
"14929",158,"patience, and my uncle’s generosity, I am mad with joy: but when I","Emma"
"14930",158,"recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little I deserve","Emma"
"14931",158,"to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her again!—But","Emma"
"14932",158,"I must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me to","Emma"
"14933",158,"encroach.—I must still add to this long letter. You have not heard all","Emma"
"14934",158,"that you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail","Emma"
"14935",158,"yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness","Emma"
"14936",158,"with which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the","Emma"
"14937",158,"event of the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me","Emma"
"14938",158,"the happiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early","Emma"
"14939",158,"measures, but from the very particular circumstances, which left me not","Emma"
"14940",158,"an hour to lose. I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty,","Emma"
"14941",158,"and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength","Emma"
"14942",158,"and refinement.—But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she had","Emma"
"14943",158,"entered into with that woman—Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to","Emma"
"14944",158,"leave off abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.—I have been","Emma"
"14945",158,"walking over the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make","Emma"
"14946",158,"the rest of my letter what it ought to be.—It is, in fact, a most","Emma"
"14947",158,"mortifying retrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can","Emma"
"14948",158,"admit, that my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were","Emma"
"14949",158,"highly blameable. _She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been","Emma"
"14950",158,"enough.—My plea of concealing the truth she did not think","Emma"
"14951",158,"sufficient.—She was displeased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought","Emma"
"14952",158,"her, on a thousand occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I","Emma"
"14953",158,"thought her even cold. But she was always right. If I had followed her","Emma"
"14954",158,"judgment, and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed","Emma"
"14955",158,"proper, I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever","Emma"
"14956",158,"known.—We quarrelled.— Do you remember the morning spent at","Emma"
"14957",158,"Donwell?—_There_ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before","Emma"
"14958",158,"came to a crisis. I was late; I met her walking home by herself, and","Emma"
"14959",158,"wanted to walk with her, but she would not suffer it. She absolutely","Emma"
"14960",158,"refused to allow me, which I then thought most unreasonable. Now,","Emma"
"14961",158,"however, I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree","Emma"
"14962",158,"of discretion. While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was","Emma"
"14963",158,"behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman,","Emma"
"14964",158,"was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made","Emma"
"14965",158,"every previous caution useless?—Had we been met walking together","Emma"
"14966",158,"between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.—I was","Emma"
"14967",158,"mad enough, however, to resent.—I doubted her affection. I doubted it","Emma"
"14968",158,"more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by such conduct on my","Emma"
"14969",158,"side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her, and such apparent","Emma"
"14970",158,"devotion to Miss W., as it would have been impossible for any woman of","Emma"
"14971",158,"sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly","Emma"
"14972",158,"intelligible to me.—In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless","Emma"
"14973",158,"on her side, abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to","Emma"
"14974",158,"Richmond, though I might have staid with you till the next morning,","Emma"
"14975",158,"merely because I would be as angry with her as possible. Even then, I","Emma"
"14976",158,"was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time; but I was","Emma"
"14977",158,"the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went away determined","Emma"
"14978",158,"that she should make the first advances.—I shall always congratulate","Emma"
"14979",158,"myself that you were not of the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my","Emma"
"14980",158,"behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well","Emma"
"14981",158,"of me again. Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it","Emma"
"14982",158,"produced: as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls, she","Emma"
"14983",158,"closed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of","Emma"
"14984",158,"whose treatment of her, by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation","Emma"
"14985",158,"and hatred. I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has","Emma"
"14986",158,"been so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly","Emma"
"14987",158,"protest against the share of it which that woman has known.—‘Jane,’","Emma"
"14988",158,"indeed!—You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling","Emma"
"14989",158,"her by that name, even to you. Think, then, what I must have endured in","Emma"
"14990",158,"hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of","Emma"
"14991",158,"needless repetition, and all the insolence of imaginary superiority.","Emma"
"14992",158,"Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.—She closed with this","Emma"
"14993",158,"offer, resolving to break with me entirely, and wrote the next day to","Emma"
"14994",158,"tell me that we never were to meet again.—_She_ _felt_ _the_","Emma"
"14995",158,"_engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_","Emma"
"14996",158,"_to_ _each_: _she_ _dissolved_ _it_.—This letter reached me on the very","Emma"
"14997",158,"morning of my poor aunt’s death. I answered it within an hour; but from","Emma"
"14998",158,"the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business falling on","Emma"
"14999",158,"me at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all the many other","Emma"
"15000",158,"letters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk; and I, trusting","Emma"
"15001",158,"that I had written enough, though but a few lines, to satisfy her,","Emma"
"15002",158,"remained without any uneasiness.—I was rather disappointed that I did","Emma"
"15003",158,"not hear from her again speedily; but I made excuses for her, and was","Emma"
"15004",158,"too busy, and—may I add?—too cheerful in my views to be captious.—We","Emma"
"15005",158,"removed to Windsor; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from","Emma"
"15006",158,"her, my own letters all returned!—and a few lines at the same time by","Emma"
"15007",158,"the post, stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest","Emma"
"15008",158,"reply to her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could","Emma"
"15009",158,"not be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both to","Emma"
"15010",158,"have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she","Emma"
"15011",158,"now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested, that","Emma"
"15012",158,"if I could not directly command hers, so as to send them to Highbury","Emma"
"15013",158,"within a week, I would forward them after that period to her at—: in","Emma"
"15014",158,"short, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge’s, near Bristol, stared me","Emma"
"15015",158,"in the face. I knew the name, the place, I knew all about it, and","Emma"
"15016",158,"instantly saw what she had been doing. It was perfectly accordant with","Emma"
"15017",158,"that resolution of character which I knew her to possess; and the","Emma"
"15018",158,"secrecy she had maintained, as to any such design in her former letter,","Emma"
"15019",158,"was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy. For the world would","Emma"
"15020",158,"not she have seemed to threaten me.—Imagine the shock; imagine how,","Emma"
"15021",158,"till I had actually detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of","Emma"
"15022",158,"the post.—What was to be done?—One thing only.—I must speak to my","Emma"
"15023",158,"uncle. Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.—I","Emma"
"15024",158,"spoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened","Emma"
"15025",158,"away his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated,","Emma"
"15026",158,"wholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man! with","Emma"
"15027",158,"a deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness in the","Emma"
"15028",158,"marriage state as he had done.—I felt that it would be of a different","Emma"
"15029",158,"sort.—Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in","Emma"
"15030",158,"opening the cause to him, for my suspense while all was at stake?—No;","Emma"
"15031",158,"do not pity me till I reached Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her.","Emma"
"15032",158,"Do not pity me till I saw her wan, sick looks.—I reached Highbury at","Emma"
"15033",158,"the time of day when, from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I","Emma"
"15034",158,"was certain of a good chance of finding her alone.—I was not","Emma"
"15035",158,"disappointed; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object","Emma"
"15036",158,"of my journey. A great deal of very reasonable, very just displeasure I","Emma"
"15037",158,"had to persuade away. But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much","Emma"
"15038",158,"dearer, than ever, and no moment’s uneasiness can ever occur between us","Emma"
"15039",158,"again. Now, my dear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude","Emma"
"15040",158,"before. A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have","Emma"
"15041",158,"ever shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will","Emma"
"15042",158,"dictate towards her.—If you think me in a way to be happier than I","Emma"
"15043",158,"deserve, I am quite of your opinion.—Miss W. calls me the child of good","Emma"
"15044",158,"fortune. I hope she is right.—In one respect, my good fortune is","Emma"
"15045",158,"undoubted, that of being able to subscribe myself,","Emma"
"15046",158,"","Emma"

"15054",158,"CHAPTER XV","Emma"
"15055",158,"","Emma"
"15056",158,"","Emma"
"15057",158,"This letter must make its way to Emma’s feelings. She was obliged, in","Emma"
"15058",158,"spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the","Emma"
"15059",158,"justice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she came to her own name,","Emma"
"15060",158,"it was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting,","Emma"
"15061",158,"and almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the","Emma"
"15062",158,"subject could still maintain itself, by the natural return of her","Emma"
"15063",158,"former regard for the writer, and the very strong attraction which any","Emma"
"15064",158,"picture of love must have for her at that moment. She never stopt till","Emma"
"15065",158,"she had gone through the whole; and though it was impossible not to","Emma"
"15066",158,"feel that he had been wrong, yet he had been less wrong than she had","Emma"
"15067",158,"supposed—and he had suffered, and was very sorry—and he was so grateful","Emma"
"15068",158,"to Mrs. Weston, and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so","Emma"
"15069",158,"happy herself, that there was no being severe; and could he have","Emma"
"15070",158,"entered the room, she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as","Emma"
"15071",158,"ever.","Emma"
"15072",158,"","Emma"
"15073",158,"She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,","Emma"
"15074",158,"she desired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston’s wishing it to","Emma"
"15075",158,"be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen","Emma"
"15076",158,"so much to blame in his conduct.","Emma"
"15077",158,"","Emma"
"15078",158,"“I shall be very glad to look it over,” said he; “but it seems long. I","Emma"
"15079",158,"will take it home with me at night.”","Emma"
"15080",158,"","Emma"
"15081",158,"But that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she","Emma"
"15082",158,"must return it by him.","Emma"
"15083",158,"","Emma"
"15084",158,"“I would rather be talking to you,” he replied; “but as it seems a","Emma"
"15085",158,"matter of justice, it shall be done.”","Emma"
"15086",158,"","Emma"
"15087",158,"He began—stopping, however, almost directly to say, “Had I been offered","Emma"
"15088",158,"the sight of one of this gentleman’s letters to his mother-in-law a few","Emma"
"15089",158,"months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.”","Emma"
"15090",158,"","Emma"
"15091",158,"He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a","Emma"
"15092",158,"smile, observed, “Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is his","Emma"
"15093",158,"way. One man’s style must not be the rule of another’s. We will not be","Emma"
"15094",158,"severe.”","Emma"
"15095",158,"","Emma"
"15096",158,"“It will be natural for me,” he added shortly afterwards, “to speak my","Emma"
"15097",158,"opinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.","Emma"
"15098",158,"It will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it—”","Emma"
"15099",158,"","Emma"
"15100",158,"“Not at all. I should wish it.”","Emma"
"15101",158,"","Emma"
"15102",158,"Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.","Emma"
"15103",158,"","Emma"
"15104",158,"“He trifles here,” said he, “as to the temptation. He knows he is","Emma"
"15105",158,"wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.—Bad.—He ought not to have","Emma"
"15106",158,"formed the engagement.—‘His father’s disposition:’—he is unjust,","Emma"
"15107",158,"however, to his father. Mr. Weston’s sanguine temper was a blessing on","Emma"
"15108",158,"all his upright and honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every","Emma"
"15109",158,"present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.—Very true; he did not","Emma"
"15110",158,"come till Miss Fairfax was here.”","Emma"
"15111",158,"","Emma"
"15112",158,"“And I have not forgotten,” said Emma, “how sure you were that he might","Emma"
"15113",158,"have come sooner if he would. You pass it over very handsomely—but you","Emma"
"15114",158,"were perfectly right.”","Emma"
"15115",158,"","Emma"
"15116",158,"“I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:—but yet, I think—had","Emma"
"15117",158,"_you_ not been in the case—I should still have distrusted him.”","Emma"
"15118",158,"","Emma"
"15119",158,"When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole of it","Emma"
"15120",158,"aloud—all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of the","Emma"
"15121",158,"head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as","Emma"
"15122",158,"the subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady","Emma"
"15123",158,"reflection, thus—","Emma"
"15124",158,"","Emma"
"15125",158,"“Very bad—though it might have been worse.—Playing a most dangerous","Emma"
"15126",158,"game. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.—No judge of his","Emma"
"15127",158,"own manners by you.—Always deceived in fact by his own wishes, and","Emma"
"15128",158,"regardless of little besides his own convenience.—Fancying you to have","Emma"
"15129",158,"fathomed his secret. Natural enough!—his own mind full of intrigue,","Emma"
"15130",158,"that he should suspect it in others.—Mystery; Finesse—how they pervert","Emma"
"15131",158,"the understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more","Emma"
"15132",158,"and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with","Emma"
"15133",158,"each other?”","Emma"
"15134",158,"","Emma"
"15135",158,"Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet’s","Emma"
"15136",158,"account, which she could not give any sincere explanation of.","Emma"
"15137",158,"","Emma"
"15138",158,"“You had better go on,” said she.","Emma"
"15139",158,"","Emma"
"15140",158,"He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, “the pianoforte! Ah! That","Emma"
"15141",158,"was the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider","Emma"
"15142",158,"whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the","Emma"
"15143",158,"pleasure. A boyish scheme, indeed!—I cannot comprehend a man’s wishing","Emma"
"15144",158,"to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather","Emma"
"15145",158,"dispense with; and he did know that she would have prevented the","Emma"
"15146",158,"instrument’s coming if she could.”","Emma"
"15147",158,"","Emma"
"15148",158,"After this, he made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill’s","Emma"
"15149",158,"confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for","Emma"
"15150",158,"more than a word in passing.","Emma"
"15151",158,"","Emma"
"15152",158,"“I perfectly agree with you, sir,”—was then his remark. “You did behave","Emma"
"15153",158,"very shamefully. You never wrote a truer line.” And having gone through","Emma"
"15154",158,"what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his","Emma"
"15155",158,"persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax’s sense of","Emma"
"15156",158,"right, he made a fuller pause to say, “This is very bad.—He had induced","Emma"
"15157",158,"her to place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme","Emma"
"15158",158,"difficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been his first object to","Emma"
"15159",158,"prevent her from suffering unnecessarily.—She must have had much more","Emma"
"15160",158,"to contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. He","Emma"
"15161",158,"should have respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such;","Emma"
"15162",158,"but hers were all reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and","Emma"
"15163",158,"remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the","Emma"
"15164",158,"engagement, to bear that she should have been in such a state of","Emma"
"15165",158,"punishment.”","Emma"
"15166",158,"","Emma"
"15167",158,"Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew","Emma"
"15168",158,"uncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper! She was","Emma"
"15169",158,"deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was all read,","Emma"
"15170",158,"however, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and,","Emma"
"15171",158,"excepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fear","Emma"
"15172",158,"of giving pain—no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.","Emma"
"15173",158,"","Emma"
"15174",158,"“There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the","Emma"
"15175",158,"Eltons,” was his next observation.—“His feelings are natural.—What!","Emma"
"15176",158,"actually resolve to break with him entirely!—She felt the engagement to","Emma"
"15177",158,"be a source of repentance and misery to each—she dissolved it.—What a","Emma"
"15178",158,"view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!—Well, he must be a most","Emma"
"15179",158,"extraordinary—”","Emma"
"15180",158,"","Emma"
"15181",158,"“Nay, nay, read on.—You will find how very much he suffers.”","Emma"
"15182",158,"","Emma"
"15183",158,"“I hope he does,” replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the","Emma"
"15184",158,"letter. “‘Smallridge!’—What does this mean? What is all this?”","Emma"
"15185",158,"","Emma"
"15186",158,"“She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge’s children—a","Emma"
"15187",158,"dear friend of Mrs. Elton’s—a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by the","Emma"
"15188",158,"bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?”","Emma"
"15189",158,"","Emma"
"15190",158,"“Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read—not even of","Emma"
"15191",158,"Mrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letter","Emma"
"15192",158,"the man writes!”","Emma"
"15193",158,"","Emma"
"15194",158,"“I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.”","Emma"
"15195",158,"","Emma"
"15196",158,"“Well, there _is_ feeling here.—He does seem to have suffered in","Emma"
"15197",158,"finding her ill.—Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of","Emma"
"15198",158,"her. ‘Dearer, much dearer than ever.’ I hope he may long continue to","Emma"
"15199",158,"feel all the value of such a reconciliation.—He is a very liberal","Emma"
"15200",158,"thanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.—‘Happier than I","Emma"
"15201",158,"deserve.’ Come, he knows himself there. ‘Miss Woodhouse calls me the","Emma"
"15202",158,"child of good fortune.’—Those were Miss Woodhouse’s words, were they?—","Emma"
"15203",158,"And a fine ending—and there is the letter. The child of good fortune!","Emma"
"15204",158,"That was your name for him, was it?”","Emma"
"15205",158,"","Emma"
"15206",158,"“You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; but still","Emma"
"15207",158,"you must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him for it. I","Emma"
"15208",158,"hope it does him some service with you.”","Emma"
"15209",158,"","Emma"
"15210",158,"“Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults of","Emma"
"15211",158,"inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion","Emma"
"15212",158,"in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he","Emma"
"15213",158,"is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it","Emma"
"15214",158,"may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I am","Emma"
"15215",158,"very ready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hers","Emma"
"15216",158,"the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let me","Emma"
"15217",158,"talk to you of something else. I have another person’s interest at","Emma"
"15218",158,"present so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank","Emma"
"15219",158,"Churchill. Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been","Emma"
"15220",158,"hard at work on one subject.”","Emma"
"15221",158,"","Emma"
"15222",158,"The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike","Emma"
"15223",158,"English, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love","Emma"
"15224",158,"with, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the","Emma"
"15225",158,"happiness of her father. Emma’s answer was ready at the first word.","Emma"
"15226",158,"“While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be","Emma"
"15227",158,"impossible for her. She could never quit him.” Part only of this","Emma"
"15228",158,"answer, however, was admitted. The impossibility of her quitting her","Emma"
"15229",158,"father, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the","Emma"
"15230",158,"inadmissibility of any other change, he could not agree to. He had been","Emma"
"15231",158,"thinking it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to","Emma"
"15232",158,"induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to","Emma"
"15233",158,"believe it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not","Emma"
"15234",158,"suffer him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his","Emma"
"15235",158,"persuasion, that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father’s","Emma"
"15236",158,"comfort, perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded. Mr.","Emma"
"15237",158,"Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!—No, he felt that it ought not to be","Emma"
"15238",158,"attempted. But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he","Emma"
"15239",158,"trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;","Emma"
"15240",158,"it was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as her","Emma"
"15241",158,"father’s happiness—in other words, his life—required Hartfield to","Emma"
"15242",158,"continue her home, it should be his likewise.","Emma"
"15243",158,"","Emma"
"15244",158,"Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own passing","Emma"
"15245",158,"thoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such","Emma"
"15246",158,"an alternative as this had not occurred to her. She was sensible of all","Emma"
"15247",158,"the affection it evinced. She felt that, in quitting Donwell, he must","Emma"
"15248",158,"be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that","Emma"
"15249",158,"in living constantly with her father, and in no house of his own, there","Emma"
"15250",158,"would be much, very much, to be borne with. She promised to think of","Emma"
"15251",158,"it, and advised him to think of it more; but he was fully convinced,","Emma"
"15252",158,"that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the","Emma"
"15253",158,"subject. He had given it, he could assure her, very long and calm","Emma"
"15254",158,"consideration; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole","Emma"
"15255",158,"morning, to have his thoughts to himself.","Emma"
"15256",158,"","Emma"
"15257",158,"“Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,” cried Emma. “I am sure","Emma"
"15258",158,"William Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent before you","Emma"
"15259",158,"ask mine.”","Emma"
"15260",158,"","Emma"
"15261",158,"She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised,","Emma"
"15262",158,"moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good","Emma"
"15263",158,"scheme.","Emma"
"15264",158,"","Emma"
"15265",158,"It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in","Emma"
"15266",158,"which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never struck","Emma"
"15267",158,"with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights as","Emma"
"15268",158,"heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think she","Emma"
"15269",158,"must of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she","Emma"
"15270",158,"only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement","Emma"
"15271",158,"in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley’s","Emma"
"15272",158,"marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she had","Emma"
"15273",158,"wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.","Emma"
"15274",158,"","Emma"
"15275",158,"This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at","Emma"
"15276",158,"Hartfield—the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.","Emma"
"15277",158,"His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their","Emma"
"15278",158,"mutual good to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself in","Emma"
"15279",158,"the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!—Such a partner in","Emma"
"15280",158,"all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of","Emma"
"15281",158,"melancholy!","Emma"
"15282",158,"","Emma"
"15283",158,"She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing","Emma"
"15284",158,"of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend,","Emma"
"15285",158,"who must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family","Emma"
"15286",158,"party which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere","Emma"
"15287",158,"charitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She would be a loser in","Emma"
"15288",158,"every way. Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction","Emma"
"15289",158,"from her own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead","Emma"
"15290",158,"weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a","Emma"
"15291",158,"peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state","Emma"
"15292",158,"of unmerited punishment.","Emma"
"15293",158,"","Emma"
"15294",158,"In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,","Emma"
"15295",158,"supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr.","Emma"
"15296",158,"Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;—not like","Emma"
"15297",158,"Mr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly","Emma"
"15298",158,"considerate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped","Emma"
"15299",158,"than now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she","Emma"
"15300",158,"could be in love with more than _three_ men in one year.","Emma"

"15305",158,"CHAPTER XVI","Emma"
"15306",158,"","Emma"
"15307",158,"","Emma"
"15308",158,"It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as","Emma"
"15309",158,"herself to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough by","Emma"
"15310",158,"letter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!","Emma"
"15311",158,"","Emma"
"15312",158,"Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without","Emma"
"15313",158,"reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there","Emma"
"15314",158,"was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in her","Emma"
"15315",158,"style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.—It","Emma"
"15316",158,"might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only","Emma"
"15317",158,"could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.","Emma"
"15318",158,"","Emma"
"15319",158,"She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella’s invitation; and she was","Emma"
"15320",158,"fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without","Emma"
"15321",158,"resorting to invention.—There was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished,","Emma"
"15322",158,"and had wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley was","Emma"
"15323",158,"delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to","Emma"
"15324",158,"her—and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was","Emma"
"15325",158,"quite eager to have Harriet under her care.—When it was thus settled on","Emma"
"15326",158,"her sister’s side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very","Emma"
"15327",158,"persuadable.—Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a","Emma"
"15328",158,"fortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse’s carriage.—It was","Emma"
"15329",158,"all arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick","Emma"
"15330",158,"Square.","Emma"
"15331",158,"","Emma"
"15332",158,"Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley’s visits; now she could","Emma"
"15333",158,"talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense","Emma"
"15334",158,"of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted","Emma"
"15335",158,"her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much","Emma"
"15336",158,"might at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the","Emma"
"15337",158,"feelings which she had led astray herself.","Emma"
"15338",158,"","Emma"
"15339",158,"The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard’s, or in London, made perhaps","Emma"
"15340",158,"an unreasonable difference in Emma’s sensations; but she could not","Emma"
"15341",158,"think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,","Emma"
"15342",158,"which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.","Emma"
"15343",158,"","Emma"
"15344",158,"She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place","Emma"
"15345",158,"in her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication","Emma"
"15346",158,"before her, one which _she_ only could be competent to make—the","Emma"
"15347",158,"confession of her engagement to her father; but she would have nothing","Emma"
"15348",158,"to do with it at present.—She had resolved to defer the disclosure till","Emma"
"15349",158,"Mrs. Weston were safe and well. No additional agitation should be","Emma"
"15350",158,"thrown at this period among those she loved—and the evil should not act","Emma"
"15351",158,"on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.—A fortnight, at","Emma"
"15352",158,"least, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more","Emma"
"15353",158,"agitating, delight, should be hers.","Emma"
"15354",158,"","Emma"
"15355",158,"She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an","Emma"
"15356",158,"hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.—She ought","Emma"
"15357",158,"to go—and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their present","Emma"
"15358",158,"situations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be a","Emma"
"15359",158,"_secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of","Emma"
"15360",158,"prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should","Emma"
"15361",158,"attend to any thing Jane might communicate.","Emma"
"15362",158,"","Emma"
"15363",158,"She went—she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not","Emma"
"15364",158,"been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane","Emma"
"15365",158,"had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all","Emma"
"15366",158,"the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.—The fear of being","Emma"
"15367",158,"still unwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home,","Emma"
"15368",158,"to wait in the passage, and send up her name.—She heard Patty","Emma"
"15369",158,"announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had","Emma"
"15370",158,"before made so happily intelligible.—No; she heard nothing but the","Emma"
"15371",158,"instant reply of, “Beg her to walk up;”—and a moment afterwards she was","Emma"
"15372",158,"met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no","Emma"
"15373",158,"other reception of her were felt sufficient.—Emma had never seen her","Emma"
"15374",158,"look so well, so lovely, so engaging. There was consciousness,","Emma"
"15375",158,"animation, and warmth; there was every thing which her countenance or","Emma"
"15376",158,"manner could ever have wanted.— She came forward with an offered hand;","Emma"
"15377",158,"and said, in a low, but very feeling tone,","Emma"
"15378",158,"","Emma"
"15379",158,"“This is most kind, indeed!—Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me to","Emma"
"15380",158,"express—I hope you will believe—Excuse me for being so entirely without","Emma"
"15381",158,"words.”","Emma"
"15382",158,"","Emma"
"15383",158,"Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the","Emma"
"15384",158,"sound of Mrs. Elton’s voice from the sitting-room had not checked her,","Emma"
"15385",158,"and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her","Emma"
"15386",158,"congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.","Emma"
"15387",158,"","Emma"
"15388",158,"Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, which","Emma"
"15389",158,"accounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs.","Emma"
"15390",158,"Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with every","Emma"
"15391",158,"body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness, she hoped","Emma"
"15392",158,"the rencontre would do them no harm.","Emma"
"15393",158,"","Emma"
"15394",158,"She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton’s thoughts, and","Emma"
"15395",158,"understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in","Emma"
"15396",158,"Miss Fairfax’s confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what","Emma"
"15397",158,"was still a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediately","Emma"
"15398",158,"in the expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to","Emma"
"15399",158,"Mrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady’s replies, she","Emma"
"15400",158,"saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which","Emma"
"15401",158,"she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it","Emma"
"15402",158,"into the purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant","Emma"
"15403",158,"nods,","Emma"
"15404",158,"","Emma"
"15405",158,"“We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall not want","Emma"
"15406",158,"opportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already.","Emma"
"15407",158,"I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is","Emma"
"15408",158,"not offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she is a sweet","Emma"
"15409",158,"creature! You would have doated on her, had you gone.—But not a word","Emma"
"15410",158,"more. Let us be discreet—quite on our good behaviour.—Hush!—You","Emma"
"15411",158,"remember those lines—I forget the poem at this moment:","Emma"
"15412",158,"","Emma"
"15413",158,"“For when a lady’s in the case,","Emma"
"15414",158,"“You know all other things give place.”","Emma"
"15415",158,"","Emma"
"15416",158,"","Emma"
"15417",158,"Now I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read——mum! a word to the","Emma"
"15418",158,"wise.—I am in a fine flow of spirits, an’t I? But I want to set your","Emma"
"15419",158,"heart at ease as to Mrs. S.—_My_ representation, you see, has quite","Emma"
"15420",158,"appeased her.”","Emma"
"15421",158,"","Emma"
"15422",158,"And again, on Emma’s merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates’s","Emma"
"15423",158,"knitting, she added, in a half whisper,","Emma"
"15424",158,"","Emma"
"15425",158,"“I mentioned no _names_, you will observe.—Oh! no; cautious as a","Emma"
"15426",158,"minister of state. I managed it extremely well.”","Emma"
"15427",158,"","Emma"
"15428",158,"Emma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on every","Emma"
"15429",158,"possible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony","Emma"
"15430",158,"of the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed","Emma"
"15431",158,"with,","Emma"
"15432",158,"","Emma"
"15433",158,"“Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is","Emma"
"15434",158,"charmingly recovered?—Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest","Emma"
"15435",158,"credit?—(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.) Upon my","Emma"
"15436",158,"word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!—Oh! if you had","Emma"
"15437",158,"seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!”—And when Mrs. Bates was","Emma"
"15438",158,"saying something to Emma, whispered farther, “We do not say a word of","Emma"
"15439",158,"any _assistance_ that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young","Emma"
"15440",158,"physician from Windsor.—Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit.”","Emma"
"15441",158,"","Emma"
"15442",158,"“I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,” she","Emma"
"15443",158,"shortly afterwards began, “since the party to Box Hill. Very pleasant","Emma"
"15444",158,"party. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did not","Emma"
"15445",158,"seem—that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.—So","Emma"
"15446",158,"it appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However, I think","Emma"
"15447",158,"it answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say you both to","Emma"
"15448",158,"our collecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again, while","Emma"
"15449",158,"the fine weather lasts?—It must be the same party, you know, quite the","Emma"
"15450",158,"same party, not _one_ exception.”","Emma"
"15451",158,"","Emma"
"15452",158,"Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being","Emma"
"15453",158,"diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting,","Emma"
"15454",158,"she supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say","Emma"
"15455",158,"every thing.","Emma"
"15456",158,"","Emma"
"15457",158,"“Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.—It is impossible","Emma"
"15458",158,"to say—Yes, indeed, I quite understand—dearest Jane’s prospects—that","Emma"
"15459",158,"is, I do not mean.—But she is charmingly recovered.—How is Mr.","Emma"
"15460",158,"Woodhouse?—I am so glad.—Quite out of my power.—Such a happy little","Emma"
"15461",158,"circle as you find us here.—Yes, indeed.—Charming young man!—that is—so","Emma"
"15462",158,"very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!—such attention to Jane!”—And from","Emma"
"15463",158,"her great, her more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton","Emma"
"15464",158,"for being there, Emma guessed that there had been a little show of","Emma"
"15465",158,"resentment towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter, which was now","Emma"
"15466",158,"graciously overcome.—After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it","Emma"
"15467",158,"beyond a guess, Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,","Emma"
"15468",158,"","Emma"
"15469",158,"“Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, that","Emma"
"15470",158,"anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth","Emma"
"15471",158,"is, that I am waiting for my lord and master. He promised to join me","Emma"
"15472",158,"here, and pay his respects to you.”","Emma"
"15473",158,"","Emma"
"15474",158,"“What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?—That will","Emma"
"15475",158,"be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits,","Emma"
"15476",158,"and Mr. Elton’s time is so engaged.”","Emma"
"15477",158,"","Emma"
"15478",158,"“Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.—He really is engaged from morning to","Emma"
"15479",158,"night.—There is no end of people’s coming to him, on some pretence or","Emma"
"15480",158,"other.—The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, are always","Emma"
"15481",158,"wanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing without","Emma"
"15482",158,"him.—‘Upon my word, Mr. E.,’ I often say, ‘rather you than I.—I do not","Emma"
"15483",158,"know what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if I had half","Emma"
"15484",158,"so many applicants.’—Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely neglect them","Emma"
"15485",158,"both to an unpardonable degree.—I believe I have not played a bar this","Emma"
"15486",158,"fortnight.—However, he is coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, on purpose","Emma"
"15487",158,"to wait on you all.” And putting up her hand to screen her words from","Emma"
"15488",158,"Emma—“A congratulatory visit, you know.—Oh! yes, quite indispensable.”","Emma"
"15489",158,"","Emma"
"15490",158,"Miss Bates looked about her, so happily—!","Emma"
"15491",158,"","Emma"
"15492",158,"“He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from","Emma"
"15493",158,"Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep","Emma"
"15494",158,"consultation.—Mr. E. is Knightley’s right hand.”","Emma"
"15495",158,"","Emma"
"15496",158,"Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, “Is Mr. Elton","Emma"
"15497",158,"gone on foot to Donwell?—He will have a hot walk.”","Emma"
"15498",158,"","Emma"
"15499",158,"“Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston and","Emma"
"15500",158,"Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who","Emma"
"15501",158,"lead.—I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way.”","Emma"
"15502",158,"","Emma"
"15503",158,"“Have not you mistaken the day?” said Emma. “I am almost certain that","Emma"
"15504",158,"the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.—Mr. Knightley was at","Emma"
"15505",158,"Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.”","Emma"
"15506",158,"","Emma"
"15507",158,"“Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,” was the abrupt answer, which","Emma"
"15508",158,"denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton’s side.—“I do","Emma"
"15509",158,"believe,” she continued, “this is the most troublesome parish that ever","Emma"
"15510",158,"was. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.”","Emma"
"15511",158,"","Emma"
"15512",158,"“Your parish there was small,” said Jane.","Emma"
"15513",158,"","Emma"
"15514",158,"“Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject","Emma"
"15515",158,"talked of.”","Emma"
"15516",158,"","Emma"
"15517",158,"“But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard","Emma"
"15518",158,"you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge;","Emma"
"15519",158,"the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.”","Emma"
"15520",158,"","Emma"
"15521",158,"“Ah! you clever creature, that’s very true. What a thinking brain you","Emma"
"15522",158,"have! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if","Emma"
"15523",158,"we could be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would","Emma"
"15524",158,"produce perfection.—Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that","Emma"
"15525",158,"_some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already.—But hush!—not a","Emma"
"15526",158,"word, if you please.”","Emma"
"15527",158,"","Emma"
"15528",158,"It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,","Emma"
"15529",158,"not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.","Emma"
"15530",158,"The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, was very","Emma"
"15531",158,"evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.","Emma"
"15532",158,"","Emma"
"15533",158,"Mr. Elton made his appearance. His lady greeted him with some of her","Emma"
"15534",158,"sparkling vivacity.","Emma"
"15535",158,"","Emma"
"15536",158,"“Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an","Emma"
"15537",158,"encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!—But","Emma"
"15538",158,"you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew I","Emma"
"15539",158,"should not stir till my lord and master appeared.—Here have I been","Emma"
"15540",158,"sitting this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal","Emma"
"15541",158,"obedience—for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?”","Emma"
"15542",158,"","Emma"
"15543",158,"Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.","Emma"
"15544",158,"His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent","Emma"
"15545",158,"object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering, and","Emma"
"15546",158,"the walk he had had for nothing.","Emma"
"15547",158,"","Emma"
"15548",158,"“When I got to Donwell,” said he, “Knightley could not be found. Very","Emma"
"15549",158,"odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning, and","Emma"
"15550",158,"the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one.”","Emma"
"15551",158,"","Emma"
"15552",158,"“Donwell!” cried his wife.—“My dear Mr. E., you have not been to","Emma"
"15553",158,"Donwell!—You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.”","Emma"
"15554",158,"","Emma"
"15555",158,"“No, no, that’s to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley","Emma"
"15556",158,"to-day on that very account.—Such a dreadful broiling morning!—I went","Emma"
"15557",158,"over the fields too—(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,) which made","Emma"
"15558",158,"it so much the worse. And then not to find him at home! I assure you I","Emma"
"15559",158,"am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The","Emma"
"15560",158,"housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.—Very","Emma"
"15561",158,"extraordinary!—And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. Perhaps to","Emma"
"15562",158,"Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.—Miss","Emma"
"15563",158,"Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!—Can you explain it?”","Emma"
"15564",158,"","Emma"
"15565",158,"Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,","Emma"
"15566",158,"indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.","Emma"
"15567",158,"","Emma"
"15568",158,"“I cannot imagine,” said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife","Emma"
"15569",158,"ought to do,) “I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you, of","Emma"
"15570",158,"all people in the world! The very last person whom one should expect to","Emma"
"15571",158,"be forgotten!—My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you, I am","Emma"
"15572",158,"sure he must.—Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;—and his","Emma"
"15573",158,"servants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely","Emma"
"15574",158,"to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often","Emma"
"15575",158,"observed, extremely awkward and remiss.—I am sure I would not have such","Emma"
"15576",158,"a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration.","Emma"
"15577",158,"And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap indeed.—She","Emma"
"15578",158,"promised Wright a receipt, and never sent it.”","Emma"
"15579",158,"","Emma"
"15580",158,"“I met William Larkins,” continued Mr. Elton, “as I got near the house,","Emma"
"15581",158,"and he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did not","Emma"
"15582",158,"believe him.—William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know what","Emma"
"15583",158,"was come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get","Emma"
"15584",158,"the speech of him. I have nothing to do with William’s wants, but it","Emma"
"15585",158,"really is of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley","Emma"
"15586",158,"to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious","Emma"
"15587",158,"inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose.”","Emma"
"15588",158,"","Emma"
"15589",158,"Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. In all","Emma"
"15590",158,"probability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr.","Emma"
"15591",158,"Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards","Emma"
"15592",158,"Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.","Emma"
"15593",158,"","Emma"
"15594",158,"She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to","Emma"
"15595",158,"attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave her","Emma"
"15596",158,"an opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,","Emma"
"15597",158,"","Emma"
"15598",158,"“It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Had you","Emma"
"15599",158,"not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted to","Emma"
"15600",158,"introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might","Emma"
"15601",158,"have been strictly correct.—I feel that I should certainly have been","Emma"
"15602",158,"impertinent.”","Emma"
"15603",158,"","Emma"
"15604",158,"“Oh!” cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought","Emma"
"15605",158,"infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual","Emma"
"15606",158,"composure—“there would have been no danger. The danger would have been","Emma"
"15607",158,"of my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than by","Emma"
"15608",158,"expressing an interest—. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking more","Emma"
"15609",158,"collectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, very","Emma"
"15610",158,"great misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that those","Emma"
"15611",158,"of my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not","Emma"
"15612",158,"disgusted to such a degree as to—I have not time for half that I could","Emma"
"15613",158,"wish to say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for","Emma"
"15614",158,"myself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately—in short, if your","Emma"
"15615",158,"compassion does not stand my friend—”","Emma"
"15616",158,"","Emma"
"15617",158,"“Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,” cried Emma warmly, and","Emma"
"15618",158,"taking her hand. “You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you","Emma"
"15619",158,"might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted","Emma"
"15620",158,"even—”","Emma"
"15621",158,"","Emma"
"15622",158,"“You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.—So cold and","Emma"
"15623",158,"artificial!—I had always a part to act.—It was a life of deceit!—I know","Emma"
"15624",158,"that I must have disgusted you.”","Emma"
"15625",158,"","Emma"
"15626",158,"“Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.","Emma"
"15627",158,"Let us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to be done","Emma"
"15628",158,"quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hope you","Emma"
"15629",158,"have pleasant accounts from Windsor?”","Emma"
"15630",158,"","Emma"
"15631",158,"“Very.”","Emma"
"15632",158,"","Emma"
"15633",158,"“And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you—just as","Emma"
"15634",158,"I begin to know you.”","Emma"
"15635",158,"","Emma"
"15636",158,"“Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am here","Emma"
"15637",158,"till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.”","Emma"
"15638",158,"","Emma"
"15639",158,"“Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,” replied Emma,","Emma"
"15640",158,"smiling—“but, excuse me, it must be thought of.”","Emma"
"15641",158,"","Emma"
"15642",158,"The smile was returned as Jane answered,","Emma"
"15643",158,"","Emma"
"15644",158,"“You are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to you, (I","Emma"
"15645",158,"am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill","Emma"
"15646",158,"at Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, at least, of","Emma"
"15647",158,"deep mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there will be nothing","Emma"
"15648",158,"more to wait for.”","Emma"
"15649",158,"","Emma"
"15650",158,"“Thank you, thank you.—This is just what I wanted to be assured of.—Oh!","Emma"

"15658",158,"","Emma"
"15659",158,"","Emma"
"15660",158,"Mrs. Weston’s friends were all made happy by her safety; and if the","Emma"
"15661",158,"satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was by","Emma"
"15662",158,"knowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been decided in","Emma"
"15663",158,"wishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge that it was with","Emma"
"15664",158,"any view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either of","Emma"
"15665",158,"Isabella’s sons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both","Emma"
"15666",158,"father and mother best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as","Emma"
"15667",158,"he grew older—and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years","Emma"
"15668",158,"hence—to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense,","Emma"
"15669",158,"the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and","Emma"
"15670",158,"Mrs. Weston—no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her;","Emma"
"15671",158,"and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to","Emma"
"15672",158,"teach, should not have their powers in exercise again.","Emma"
"15673",158,"","Emma"
"15674",158,"“She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,” she","Emma"
"15675",158,"continued—“like La Baronne d’Almane on La Comtesse d’Ostalis, in Madame","Emma"
"15676",158,"de Genlis’ Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her own little","Emma"
"15677",158,"Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan.”","Emma"
"15678",158,"","Emma"
"15679",158,"“That is,” replied Mr. Knightley, “she will indulge her even more than","Emma"
"15680",158,"she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. It will","Emma"
"15681",158,"be the only difference.”","Emma"
"15682",158,"","Emma"
"15683",158,"“Poor child!” cried Emma; “at that rate, what will become of her?”","Emma"
"15684",158,"","Emma"
"15685",158,"“Nothing very bad.—The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeable in","Emma"
"15686",158,"infancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing all my","Emma"
"15687",158,"bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owing","Emma"
"15688",158,"all my happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me","Emma"
"15689",158,"to be severe on them?”","Emma"
"15690",158,"","Emma"
"15691",158,"Emma laughed, and replied: “But I had the assistance of all your","Emma"
"15692",158,"endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt","Emma"
"15693",158,"whether my own sense would have corrected me without it.”","Emma"
"15694",158,"","Emma"
"15695",158,"“Do you?—I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:—Miss Taylor","Emma"
"15696",158,"gave you principles. You must have done well. My interference was quite","Emma"
"15697",158,"as likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, what","Emma"
"15698",158,"right has he to lecture me?—and I am afraid very natural for you to","Emma"
"15699",158,"feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I did","Emma"
"15700",158,"you any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of","Emma"
"15701",158,"the tenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much","Emma"
"15702",158,"without doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many","Emma"
"15703",158,"errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at","Emma"
"15704",158,"least.”","Emma"
"15705",158,"","Emma"
"15706",158,"“I am sure you were of use to me,” cried Emma. “I was very often","Emma"
"15707",158,"influenced rightly by you—oftener than I would own at the time. I am","Emma"
"15708",158,"very sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to be","Emma"
"15709",158,"spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her","Emma"
"15710",158,"as you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she is","Emma"
"15711",158,"thirteen.”","Emma"
"15712",158,"","Emma"
"15713",158,"“How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your","Emma"
"15714",158,"saucy looks—‘Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I","Emma"
"15715",158,"may, or I have Miss Taylor’s leave’—something which, you knew, I did","Emma"
"15716",158,"not approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two bad","Emma"

"15718",158,"","Emma"
"15719",158,"“What an amiable creature I was!—No wonder you should hold my speeches","Emma"

"15722",158,"“‘Mr. Knightley.’—You always called me, ‘Mr. Knightley;’ and, from","Emma"

"15725",158,"","Emma"
"15726",158,"“I remember once calling you ‘George,’ in one of my amiable fits, about","Emma"
"15727",158,"ten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as","Emma"

"15732",158,"“Impossible!—I never can call you any thing but ‘Mr. Knightley.’ I will","Emma"

"15734",158,"calling you Mr. K.—But I will promise,” she added presently, laughing","Emma"
"15735",158,"and blushing—“I will promise to call you once by your Christian name. I","Emma"
"15736",158,"do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;—in the building in","Emma"
"15737",158,"which N. takes M. for better, for worse.”","Emma"
"15738",158,"","Emma"
"15739",158,"Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important","Emma"
"15740",158,"service which his better sense would have rendered her, to the advice","Emma"
"15741",158,"which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly","Emma"
"15742",158,"follies—her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a","Emma"
"15743",158,"subject.—She could not enter on it.—Harriet was very seldom mentioned","Emma"
"15744",158,"between them. This, on his side, might merely proceed from her not","Emma"
"15745",158,"being thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to","Emma"
"15746",158,"delicacy, and a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship","Emma"
"15747",158,"were declining. She was aware herself, that, parting under any other","Emma"
"15748",158,"circumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that","Emma"
"15749",158,"her intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on","Emma"
"15750",158,"Isabella’s letters. He might observe that it was so. The pain of being","Emma"
"15751",158,"obliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little inferior","Emma"
"15752",158,"to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.","Emma"
"15753",158,"","Emma"
"15754",158,"Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be","Emma"
"15755",158,"expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,","Emma"
"15756",158,"which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be","Emma"
"15757",158,"consulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not appear","Emma"
"15758",158,"to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.—Isabella,","Emma"
"15759",158,"to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been","Emma"
"15760",158,"equal to playing with the children, it would not have escaped her.","Emma"
"15761",158,"Emma’s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet’s","Emma"
"15762",158,"being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least.","Emma"
"15763",158,"Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August, and she was","Emma"
"15764",158,"invited to remain till they could bring her back.","Emma"
"15765",158,"","Emma"
"15766",158,"“John does not even mention your friend,” said Mr. Knightley. “Here is","Emma"
"15767",158,"his answer, if you like to see it.”","Emma"
"15768",158,"","Emma"
"15769",158,"It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage. Emma","Emma"
"15770",158,"accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to","Emma"
"15771",158,"know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that","Emma"
"15772",158,"her friend was unmentioned.","Emma"
"15773",158,"","Emma"
"15774",158,"“John enters like a brother into my happiness,” continued Mr.","Emma"
"15775",158,"Knightley, “but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to","Emma"
"15776",158,"have, likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from","Emma"
"15777",158,"making flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather","Emma"
"15778",158,"cool in her praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.”","Emma"
"15779",158,"","Emma"
"15780",158,"“He writes like a sensible man,” replied Emma, when she had read the","Emma"
"15781",158,"letter. “I honour his sincerity. It is very plain that he considers the","Emma"
"15782",158,"good fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is not","Emma"
"15783",158,"without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as","Emma"
"15784",158,"you think me already. Had he said any thing to bear a different","Emma"
"15785",158,"construction, I should not have believed him.”","Emma"
"15786",158,"","Emma"
"15787",158,"“My Emma, he means no such thing. He only means—”","Emma"
"15788",158,"","Emma"
"15789",158,"“He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,”","Emma"
"15790",158,"interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile—“much less, perhaps, than","Emma"
"15791",158,"he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the","Emma"
"15792",158,"subject.”","Emma"
"15793",158,"","Emma"
"15794",158,"“Emma, my dear Emma—”","Emma"
"15795",158,"","Emma"
"15796",158,"“Oh!” she cried with more thorough gaiety, “if you fancy your brother","Emma"
"15797",158,"does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret,","Emma"
"15798",158,"and hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he will be much farther from","Emma"
"15799",158,"doing _you_ justice. He will think all the happiness, all the","Emma"
"15800",158,"advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish","Emma"
"15801",158,"I may not sink into ‘poor Emma’ with him at once.—His tender compassion","Emma"
"15802",158,"towards oppressed worth can go no farther.”","Emma"
"15803",158,"","Emma"
"15804",158,"“Ah!” he cried, “I wish your father might be half as easily convinced","Emma"
"15805",158,"as John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give,","Emma"
"15806",158,"to be happy together. I am amused by one part of John’s letter—did you","Emma"
"15807",158,"notice it?—where he says, that my information did not take him wholly","Emma"
"15808",158,"by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of","Emma"
"15809",158,"the kind.”","Emma"
"15810",158,"","Emma"
"15811",158,"“If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having some","Emma"
"15812",158,"thoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems perfectly","Emma"
"15813",158,"unprepared for that.”","Emma"
"15814",158,"","Emma"
"15815",158,"“Yes, yes—but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my","Emma"
"15816",158,"feelings. What has he been judging by?—I am not conscious of any","Emma"
"15817",158,"difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this","Emma"
"15818",158,"time for my marrying any more than at another.—But it was so, I","Emma"
"15819",158,"suppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them","Emma"
"15820",158,"the other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so much","Emma"
"15821",158,"as usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, ‘Uncle seems","Emma"
"15822",158,"always tired now.’”","Emma"
"15823",158,"","Emma"
"15824",158,"The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other","Emma"
"15825",158,"persons’ reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently","Emma"
"15826",158,"recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse’s visits, Emma having it in view that","Emma"
"15827",158,"her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first","Emma"
"15828",158,"to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.—But how to break it to","Emma"
"15829",158,"her father at last!—She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of","Emma"
"15830",158,"Mr. Knightley’s absence, or when it came to the point her heart would","Emma"
"15831",158,"have failed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to","Emma"
"15832",158,"come at such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.—She","Emma"
"15833",158,"was forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it","Emma"
"15834",158,"a more decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.","Emma"
"15835",158,"She must not appear to think it a misfortune.—With all the spirits she","Emma"
"15836",158,"could command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then,","Emma"
"15837",158,"in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be","Emma"
"15838",158,"obtained—which, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty,","Emma"
"15839",158,"since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all—she and Mr.","Emma"
"15840",158,"Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the","Emma"
"15841",158,"constant addition of that person’s company whom she knew he loved, next","Emma"
"15842",158,"to his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.","Emma"
"15843",158,"","Emma"
"15844",158,"Poor man!—it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried","Emma"
"15845",158,"earnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more than once, of","Emma"
"15846",158,"having always said she would never marry, and assured that it would be","Emma"
"15847",158,"a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor","Emma"
"15848",158,"Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.—But it would not do. Emma hung about","Emma"
"15849",158,"him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he","Emma"
"15850",158,"must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages","Emma"
"15851",158,"taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but","Emma"
"15852",158,"she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was","Emma"
"15853",158,"introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the","Emma"
"15854",158,"better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier","Emma"
"15855",158,"for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once got used to","Emma"
"15856",158,"the idea.—Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?—He would not deny","Emma"
"15857",158,"that he did, she was sure.—Whom did he ever want to consult on business","Emma"
"15858",158,"but Mr. Knightley?—Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his","Emma"
"15859",158,"letters, who so glad to assist him?—Who so cheerful, so attentive, so","Emma"
"15860",158,"attached to him?—Would not he like to have him always on the spot?—Yes.","Emma"
"15861",158,"That was all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he","Emma"
"15862",158,"should be glad to see him every day;—but they did see him every day as","Emma"
"15863",158,"it was.—Why could not they go on as they had done?","Emma"
"15864",158,"","Emma"
"15865",158,"Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,","Emma"
"15866",158,"the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.—To","Emma"
"15867",158,"Emma’s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley’s, whose fond","Emma"
"15868",158,"praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon","Emma"
"15869",158,"used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.—They had all the","Emma"
"15870",158,"assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest","Emma"
"15871",158,"approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to","Emma"
"15872",158,"consider the subject in the most serviceable light—first, as a settled,","Emma"
"15873",158,"and, secondly, as a good one—well aware of the nearly equal importance","Emma"
"15874",158,"of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse’s mind.—It was agreed upon,","Emma"
"15875",158,"as what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be guided","Emma"
"15876",158,"assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some","Emma"
"15877",158,"feelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that some","Emma"
"15878",158,"time or other—in another year or two, perhaps—it might not be so very","Emma"
"15879",158,"bad if the marriage did take place.","Emma"
"15880",158,"","Emma"
"15881",158,"Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she","Emma"
"15882",158,"said to him in favour of the event.—She had been extremely surprized,","Emma"
"15883",158,"never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but she","Emma"
"15884",158,"saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in","Emma"
"15885",158,"urging him to the utmost.—She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as","Emma"
"15886",158,"to think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect","Emma"
"15887",158,"so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one","Emma"
"15888",158,"respect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible,","Emma"
"15889",158,"so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely","Emma"
"15890",158,"have attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herself","Emma"
"15891",158,"been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it","Emma"
"15892",158,"long ago.—How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma","Emma"
"15893",158,"would have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.","Emma"
"15894",158,"Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an","Emma"
"15895",158,"arrangement desirable!—The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr.","Emma"
"15896",158,"Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband’s plans and her own, for","Emma"
"15897",158,"a marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe","Emma"
"15898",158,"and Hartfield had been a continual impediment—less acknowledged by Mr.","Emma"
"15899",158,"Weston than by herself—but even he had never been able to finish the","Emma"
"15900",158,"subject better than by saying—“Those matters will take care of","Emma"
"15901",158,"themselves; the young people will find a way.” But here there was","Emma"
"15902",158,"nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was","Emma"
"15903",158,"all right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the","Emma"
"15904",158,"name. It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and","Emma"
"15905",158,"without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.","Emma"
"15906",158,"","Emma"
"15907",158,"Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections","Emma"
"15908",158,"as these, was one of the happiest women in the world. If any thing","Emma"
"15909",158,"could increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon","Emma"
"15910",158,"have outgrown its first set of caps.","Emma"
"15911",158,"","Emma"
"15912",158,"The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston","Emma"
"15913",158,"had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to","Emma"
"15914",158,"familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.—He saw the advantages of","Emma"
"15915",158,"the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife; but","Emma"
"15916",158,"the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he","Emma"
"15917",158,"was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.","Emma"
"15918",158,"","Emma"
"15919",158,"“It is to be a secret, I conclude,” said he. “These matters are always","Emma"
"15920",158,"a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let me","Emma"
"15921",158,"be told when I may speak out.—I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion.”","Emma"
"15922",158,"","Emma"
"15923",158,"He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that","Emma"
"15924",158,"point. He told her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his eldest","Emma"
"15925",158,"daughter?—he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed, of","Emma"
"15926",158,"course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately","Emma"
"15927",158,"afterwards. It was no more than the principals were prepared for; they","Emma"
"15928",158,"had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soon","Emma"
"15929",158,"it would be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the","Emma"
"15930",158,"evening wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.","Emma"
"15931",158,"","Emma"
"15932",158,"In general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him,","Emma"
"15933",158,"and others might think her, the most in luck. One set might recommend","Emma"
"15934",158,"their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John","Emma"
"15935",158,"Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements among their","Emma"
"15936",158,"servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious objection","Emma"
"15937",158,"raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.—There, the surprize was","Emma"
"15938",158,"not softened by any satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it,","Emma"
"15939",158,"compared with his wife; he only hoped “the young lady’s pride would now","Emma"
"15940",158,"be contented;” and supposed “she had always meant to catch Knightley if","Emma"
"15941",158,"she could;” and, on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly","Emma"
"15942",158,"exclaim, “Rather he than I!”—But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed","Emma"
"15943",158,"indeed.—“Poor Knightley! poor fellow!—sad business for him.”—She was","Emma"
"15944",158,"extremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good","Emma"
"15945",158,"qualities.—How could he be so taken in?—Did not think him at all in","Emma"
"15946",158,"love—not in the least.—Poor Knightley!—There would be an end of all","Emma"
"15947",158,"pleasant intercourse with him.—How happy he had been to come and dine","Emma"
"15948",158,"with them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over now.—Poor","Emma"
"15949",158,"fellow!—No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_. Oh! no;","Emma"
"15950",158,"there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every","Emma"
"15951",158,"thing.—Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all sorry that she","Emma"
"15952",158,"had abused the housekeeper the other day.—Shocking plan, living","Emma"
"15953",158,"together. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple Grove who had","Emma"
"15954",158,"tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the first","Emma"
"15955",158,"quarter.","Emma"

"15960",158,"CHAPTER XVIII","Emma"
"15961",158,"","Emma"
"15962",158,"","Emma"
"15963",158,"Time passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would","Emma"
"15964",158,"be arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one","Emma"
"15965",158,"morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her,","Emma"
"15966",158,"when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After","Emma"
"15967",158,"the first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone,","Emma"
"15968",158,"began with,","Emma"
"15969",158,"","Emma"
"15970",158,"“I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.”","Emma"
"15971",158,"","Emma"
"15972",158,"“Good or bad?” said she, quickly, looking up in his face.","Emma"
"15973",158,"","Emma"
"15974",158,"“I do not know which it ought to be called.”","Emma"
"15975",158,"","Emma"
"15976",158,"“Oh! good I am sure.—I see it in your countenance. You are trying not","Emma"
"15977",158,"to smile.”","Emma"
"15978",158,"","Emma"
"15979",158,"“I am afraid,” said he, composing his features, “I am very much afraid,","Emma"
"15980",158,"my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.”","Emma"
"15981",158,"","Emma"
"15982",158,"“Indeed! but why so?—I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases","Emma"
"15983",158,"or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.”","Emma"
"15984",158,"","Emma"
"15985",158,"“There is one subject,” he replied, “I hope but one, on which we do not","Emma"
"15986",158,"think alike.” He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes fixed on","Emma"
"15987",158,"her face. “Does nothing occur to you?—Do not you recollect?—Harriet","Emma"
"15988",158,"Smith.”","Emma"
"15989",158,"","Emma"
"15990",158,"Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something,","Emma"
"15991",158,"though she knew not what.","Emma"
"15992",158,"","Emma"
"15993",158,"“Have you heard from her yourself this morning?” cried he. “You have, I","Emma"
"15994",158,"believe, and know the whole.”","Emma"
"15995",158,"","Emma"
"15996",158,"“No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.”","Emma"
"15997",158,"","Emma"
"15998",158,"“You are prepared for the worst, I see—and very bad it is. Harriet","Emma"
"15999",158,"Smith marries Robert Martin.”","Emma"
"16000",158,"","Emma"
"16001",158,"Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared—and her eyes,","Emma"
"16002",158,"in eager gaze, said, “No, this is impossible!” but her lips were","Emma"
"16003",158,"closed.","Emma"
"16004",158,"","Emma"
"16005",158,"“It is so, indeed,” continued Mr. Knightley; “I have it from Robert","Emma"
"16006",158,"Martin himself. He left me not half an hour ago.”","Emma"
"16007",158,"","Emma"
"16008",158,"She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.","Emma"
"16009",158,"","Emma"
"16010",158,"“You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.—I wish our opinions were","Emma"
"16011",158,"the same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make one","Emma"
"16012",158,"or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need","Emma"
"16013",158,"not talk much on the subject.”","Emma"
"16014",158,"","Emma"
"16015",158,"“You mistake me, you quite mistake me,” she replied, exerting herself.","Emma"
"16016",158,"“It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I","Emma"
"16017",158,"cannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!—You cannot mean to say,","Emma"
"16018",158,"that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that he","Emma"
"16019",158,"has even proposed to her again—yet. You only mean, that he intends it.”","Emma"
"16020",158,"","Emma"
"16021",158,"“I mean that he has done it,” answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but","Emma"
"16022",158,"determined decision, “and been accepted.”","Emma"
"16023",158,"","Emma"
"16024",158,"“Good God!” she cried.—“Well!”—Then having recourse to her workbasket,","Emma"
"16025",158,"in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the exquisite","Emma"
"16026",158,"feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be","Emma"
"16027",158,"expressing, she added, “Well, now tell me every thing; make this","Emma"
"16028",158,"intelligible to me. How, where, when?—Let me know it all. I never was","Emma"
"16029",158,"more surprized—but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.—How—how","Emma"
"16030",158,"has it been possible?”","Emma"
"16031",158,"","Emma"
"16032",158,"“It is a very simple story. He went to town on business three days ago,","Emma"
"16033",158,"and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send","Emma"
"16034",158,"to John.—He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was","Emma"
"16035",158,"asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley’s. They","Emma"
"16036",158,"were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley’s. The party was to be","Emma"
"16037",158,"our brother and sister, Henry, John—and Miss Smith. My friend Robert","Emma"
"16038",158,"could not resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremely","Emma"
"16039",158,"amused; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day—which","Emma"
"16040",158,"he did—and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an","Emma"
"16041",158,"opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in","Emma"
"16042",158,"vain.—She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is","Emma"
"16043",158,"deserving. He came down by yesterday’s coach, and was with me this","Emma"
"16044",158,"morning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first","Emma"
"16045",158,"on my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate of","Emma"
"16046",158,"the how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much longer","Emma"
"16047",158,"history when you see her.—She will give you all the minute particulars,","Emma"
"16048",158,"which only woman’s language can make interesting.—In our communications","Emma"
"16049",158,"we deal only in the great.—However, I must say, that Robert Martin’s","Emma"
"16050",158,"heart seemed for _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing; and that he did","Emma"
"16051",158,"mention, without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their","Emma"
"16052",158,"box at Astley’s, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and","Emma"
"16053",158,"little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one","Emma"
"16054",158,"time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy.”","Emma"
"16055",158,"","Emma"
"16056",158,"He stopped.—Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, she","Emma"
"16057",158,"was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness.","Emma"
"16058",158,"She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. Her silence","Emma"
"16059",158,"disturbed him; and after observing her a little while, he added,","Emma"
"16060",158,"","Emma"
"16061",158,"“Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you","Emma"
"16062",158,"unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. His","Emma"
"16063",158,"situation is an evil—but you must consider it as what satisfies your","Emma"
"16064",158,"friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as","Emma"
"16065",158,"you know him more. His good sense and good principles would delight","Emma"
"16066",158,"you.—As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend in","Emma"
"16067",158,"better hands. His rank in society I would alter if I could, which is","Emma"
"16068",158,"saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.—You laugh at me about William","Emma"
"16069",158,"Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.”","Emma"
"16070",158,"","Emma"
"16071",158,"He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not","Emma"
"16072",158,"to smile too broadly—she did—cheerfully answering,","Emma"
"16073",158,"","Emma"
"16074",158,"“You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think","Emma"
"16075",158,"Harriet is doing extremely well. _Her_ connexions may be worse than","Emma"
"16076",158,"_his_. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they","Emma"
"16077",158,"are. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You","Emma"
"16078",158,"cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly","Emma"
"16079",158,"unprepared I was!—for I had reason to believe her very lately more","Emma"
"16080",158,"determined against him, much more, than she was before.”","Emma"
"16081",158,"","Emma"
"16082",158,"“You ought to know your friend best,” replied Mr. Knightley; “but I","Emma"
"16083",158,"should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be","Emma"
"16084",158,"very, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.”","Emma"
"16085",158,"","Emma"
"16086",158,"Emma could not help laughing as she answered, “Upon my word, I believe","Emma"
"16087",158,"you know her quite as well as I do.—But, Mr. Knightley, are you","Emma"
"16088",158,"perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him. I","Emma"
"16089",158,"could suppose she might in time—but can she already?—Did not you","Emma"
"16090",158,"misunderstand him?—You were both talking of other things; of business,","Emma"
"16091",158,"shows of cattle, or new drills—and might not you, in the confusion of","Emma"
"16092",158,"so many subjects, mistake him?—It was not Harriet’s hand that he was","Emma"
"16093",158,"certain of—it was the dimensions of some famous ox.”","Emma"
"16094",158,"","Emma"
"16095",158,"The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and","Emma"
"16096",158,"Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma’s feelings, and so","Emma"
"16097",158,"strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on","Emma"
"16098",158,"Harriet’s side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such","Emma"
"16099",158,"emphasis, “No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,”","Emma"
"16100",158,"that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some","Emma"
"16101",158,"measure, premature. It could not be otherwise.","Emma"
"16102",158,"","Emma"
"16103",158,"“Do you dare say this?” cried Mr. Knightley. “Do you dare to suppose me","Emma"
"16104",158,"so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?—What do","Emma"
"16105",158,"you deserve?”","Emma"
"16106",158,"","Emma"
"16107",158,"“Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with","Emma"
"16108",158,"any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are","Emma"
"16109",158,"you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and","Emma"
"16110",158,"Harriet now are?”","Emma"
"16111",158,"","Emma"
"16112",158,"“I am quite sure,” he replied, speaking very distinctly, “that he told","Emma"
"16113",158,"me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothing","Emma"
"16114",158,"doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof that","Emma"
"16115",158,"it must be so. He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knew","Emma"
"16116",158,"of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of","Emma"
"16117",158,"her relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be","Emma"
"16118",158,"done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him that I could not. Then,","Emma"
"16119",158,"he said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.”","Emma"
"16120",158,"","Emma"
"16121",158,"“I am perfectly satisfied,” replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,","Emma"
"16122",158,"“and most sincerely wish them happy.”","Emma"
"16123",158,"","Emma"
"16124",158,"“You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.”","Emma"
"16125",158,"","Emma"
"16126",158,"“I hope so—for at that time I was a fool.”","Emma"
"16127",158,"","Emma"
"16128",158,"“And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all","Emma"
"16129",158,"Harriet’s good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and","Emma"
"16130",158,"for Robert Martin’s sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as","Emma"
"16131",158,"much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I have","Emma"
"16132",158,"often talked to her a good deal. You must have seen that I did.","Emma"
"16133",158,"Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of","Emma"
"16134",158,"pleading poor Martin’s cause, which was never the case; but, from all","Emma"
"16135",158,"my observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,","Emma"
"16136",158,"with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing her","Emma"
"16137",158,"happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.—Much of this,","Emma"
"16138",158,"I have no doubt, she may thank you for.”","Emma"
"16139",158,"","Emma"
"16140",158,"“Me!” cried Emma, shaking her head.—“Ah! poor Harriet!”","Emma"
"16141",158,"","Emma"
"16142",158,"She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more","Emma"
"16143",158,"praise than she deserved.","Emma"
"16144",158,"","Emma"
"16145",158,"Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her","Emma"
"16146",158,"father. She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was in a","Emma"
"16147",158,"state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her to be","Emma"
"16148",158,"collected. She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till","Emma"
"16149",158,"she had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected,","Emma"
"16150",158,"she could be fit for nothing rational.","Emma"
"16151",158,"","Emma"
"16152",158,"Her father’s business was to announce James’s being gone out to put the","Emma"
"16153",158,"horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she","Emma"
"16154",158,"had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.","Emma"
"16155",158,"","Emma"
"16156",158,"The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations may be","Emma"
"16157",158,"imagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of","Emma"
"16158",158,"Harriet’s welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy for","Emma"
"16159",158,"security.—What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of","Emma"
"16160",158,"him, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her","Emma"
"16161",158,"own. Nothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her","Emma"
"16162",158,"humility and circumspection in future.","Emma"
"16163",158,"","Emma"
"16164",158,"Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her","Emma"
"16165",158,"resolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the","Emma"
"16166",158,"very midst of them. She must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the","Emma"
"16167",158,"doleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart—such a Harriet!","Emma"
"16168",158,"","Emma"
"16169",158,"Now there would be pleasure in her returning—Every thing would be a","Emma"
"16170",158,"pleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.","Emma"
"16171",158,"","Emma"
"16172",158,"High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the","Emma"
"16173",158,"reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would","Emma"
"16174",158,"soon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her to","Emma"
"16175",158,"practise, might soon be over. She could now look forward to giving him","Emma"
"16176",158,"that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready","Emma"
"16177",158,"to welcome as a duty.","Emma"
"16178",158,"","Emma"
"16179",158,"In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not","Emma"
"16180",158,"always listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in","Emma"
"16181",158,"speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being","Emma"
"16182",158,"obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be","Emma"
"16183",158,"disappointed.","Emma"
"16184",158,"","Emma"
"16185",158,"They arrived.—Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:—but hardly had","Emma"
"16186",158,"they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for","Emma"
"16187",158,"coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the","Emma"
"16188",158,"blind, of two figures passing near the window.","Emma"
"16189",158,"","Emma"
"16190",158,"“It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,” said Mrs. Weston. “I was just going to","Emma"
"16191",158,"tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning.","Emma"
"16192",158,"He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend","Emma"
"16193",158,"the day with us.—They are coming in, I hope.”","Emma"
"16194",158,"","Emma"
"16195",158,"In half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad to see","Emma"
"16196",158,"him—but there was a degree of confusion—a number of embarrassing","Emma"
"16197",158,"recollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with a","Emma"
"16198",158,"consciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all","Emma"
"16199",158,"sat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle,","Emma"
"16200",158,"that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had","Emma"
"16201",158,"long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him with","Emma"
"16202",158,"Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined","Emma"
"16203",158,"the party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer","Emma"
"16204",158,"a want of subject or animation—or of courage and opportunity for Frank","Emma"
"16205",158,"Churchill to draw near her and say,","Emma"
"16206",158,"","Emma"
"16207",158,"“I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message","Emma"
"16208",158,"in one of Mrs. Weston’s letters. I hope time has not made you less","Emma"
"16209",158,"willing to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said.”","Emma"
"16210",158,"","Emma"
"16211",158,"“No, indeed,” cried Emma, most happy to begin, “not in the least. I am","Emma"
"16212",158,"particularly glad to see and shake hands with you—and to give you joy","Emma"
"16213",158,"in person.”","Emma"
"16214",158,"","Emma"
"16215",158,"He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak","Emma"
"16216",158,"with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.","Emma"
"16217",158,"","Emma"
"16218",158,"“Is not she looking well?” said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.","Emma"
"16219",158,"“Better than she ever used to do?—You see how my father and Mrs. Weston","Emma"
"16220",158,"doat upon her.”","Emma"
"16221",158,"","Emma"
"16222",158,"But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after","Emma"
"16223",158,"mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named the name of","Emma"
"16224",158,"Dixon.—Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing.","Emma"
"16225",158,"","Emma"
"16226",158,"“I can never think of it,” she cried, “without extreme shame.”","Emma"
"16227",158,"","Emma"
"16228",158,"“The shame,” he answered, “is all mine, or ought to be. But is it","Emma"
"16229",158,"possible that you had no suspicion?—I mean of late. Early, I know, you","Emma"
"16230",158,"had none.”","Emma"
"16231",158,"","Emma"
"16232",158,"“I never had the smallest, I assure you.”","Emma"
"16233",158,"","Emma"
"16234",158,"“That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near—and I wish I had—it","Emma"
"16235",158,"would have been better. But though I was always doing wrong things,","Emma"
"16236",158,"they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.—It","Emma"
"16237",158,"would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of","Emma"
"16238",158,"secrecy and told you every thing.”","Emma"
"16239",158,"","Emma"
"16240",158,"“It is not now worth a regret,” said Emma.","Emma"
"16241",158,"","Emma"
"16242",158,"“I have some hope,” resumed he, “of my uncle’s being persuaded to pay a","Emma"
"16243",158,"visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When the Campbells","Emma"
"16244",158,"are returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I","Emma"
"16245",158,"trust, till we may carry her northward.—But now, I am at such a","Emma"
"16246",158,"distance from her—is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?—Till this morning, we","Emma"
"16247",158,"have not once met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?”","Emma"
"16248",158,"","Emma"
"16249",158,"Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay","Emma"
"16250",158,"thought, he cried,","Emma"
"16251",158,"","Emma"
"16252",158,"“Ah! by the bye,” then sinking his voice, and looking demure for the","Emma"
"16253",158,"moment—“I hope Mr. Knightley is well?” He paused.—She coloured and","Emma"
"16254",158,"laughed.—“I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish","Emma"
"16255",158,"in your favour. Let me return your congratulations.—I assure you that I","Emma"
"16256",158,"have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.—He is a","Emma"
"16257",158,"man whom I cannot presume to praise.”","Emma"
"16258",158,"","Emma"
"16259",158,"Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style; but","Emma"
"16260",158,"his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane,","Emma"
"16261",158,"and his next words were,","Emma"
"16262",158,"","Emma"
"16263",158,"“Did you ever see such a skin?—such smoothness! such delicacy!—and yet","Emma"
"16264",158,"without being actually fair.—One cannot call her fair. It is a most","Emma"
"16265",158,"uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair—a most","Emma"
"16266",158,"distinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.—Just colour","Emma"
"16267",158,"enough for beauty.”","Emma"
"16268",158,"","Emma"
"16269",158,"“I have always admired her complexion,” replied Emma, archly; “but do","Emma"
"16270",158,"not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so","Emma"
"16271",158,"pale?—When we first began to talk of her.—Have you quite forgotten?”","Emma"
"16272",158,"","Emma"
"16273",158,"“Oh! no—what an impudent dog I was!—How could I dare—”","Emma"
"16274",158,"","Emma"
"16275",158,"But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not","Emma"
"16276",158,"help saying,","Emma"
"16277",158,"","Emma"
"16278",158,"“I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you","Emma"
"16279",158,"had very great amusement in tricking us all.—I am sure you had.—I am","Emma"
"16280",158,"sure it was a consolation to you.”","Emma"
"16281",158,"","Emma"
"16282",158,"“Oh! no, no, no—how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the most","Emma"
"16283",158,"miserable wretch!”","Emma"
"16284",158,"","Emma"
"16285",158,"“Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was","Emma"
"16286",158,"a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us","Emma"
"16287",158,"all in.—Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the","Emma"
"16288",158,"truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same","Emma"
"16289",158,"situation. I think there is a little likeness between us.”","Emma"
"16290",158,"","Emma"
"16291",158,"He bowed.","Emma"
"16292",158,"","Emma"
"16293",158,"“If not in our dispositions,” she presently added, with a look of true","Emma"
"16294",158,"sensibility, “there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which","Emma"
"16295",158,"bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our","Emma"
"16296",158,"own.”","Emma"
"16297",158,"","Emma"
"16298",158,"“True, true,” he answered, warmly. “No, not true on your side. You can","Emma"
"16299",158,"have no superior, but most true on mine.—She is a complete angel. Look","Emma"
"16300",158,"at her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of her","Emma"
"16301",158,"throat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.—You will","Emma"
"16302",158,"be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously) that my","Emma"
"16303",158,"uncle means to give her all my aunt’s jewels. They are to be new set. I","Emma"
"16304",158,"am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be","Emma"
"16305",158,"beautiful in her dark hair?”","Emma"
"16306",158,"","Emma"
"16307",158,"“Very beautiful, indeed,” replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly, that","Emma"
"16308",158,"he gratefully burst out,","Emma"
"16309",158,"","Emma"
"16310",158,"“How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent","Emma"
"16311",158,"looks!—I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should","Emma"

"16314",158,"The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account","Emma"
"16315",158,"of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, from the","Emma"
"16316",158,"infant’s appearing not quite well. She believed she had been foolish,","Emma"
"16317",158,"but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minute of","Emma"
"16318",158,"sending for Mr. Perry. Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston","Emma"
"16319",158,"had been almost as uneasy as herself.—In ten minutes, however, the","Emma"
"16320",158,"child had been perfectly well again. This was her history; and","Emma"
"16321",158,"particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her","Emma"
"16322",158,"very much for thinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that","Emma"
"16323",158,"she had not done it. “She should always send for Perry, if the child","Emma"
"16324",158,"appeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment.","Emma"
"16325",158,"She could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was","Emma"
"16326",158,"a pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night; for, though the child","Emma"
"16327",158,"seemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have been","Emma"
"16328",158,"better if Perry had seen it.”","Emma"

"16336",158,"","Emma"
"16337",158,"Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the","Emma"

"16339",158,"hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.","Emma"
"16340",158,"","Emma"
"16341",158,"“Such an extraordinary dream of mine!” he cried. “I can never think of","Emma"
"16342",158,"it without laughing.—She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see","Emma"
"16343",158,"it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her. Do","Emma"
"16344",158,"not you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter,","Emma"
"16345",158,"which sent me the report, is passing under her eye—that the whole","Emma"
"16346",158,"blunder is spread before her—that she can attend to nothing else,","Emma"
"16347",158,"though pretending to listen to the others?”","Emma"
"16348",158,"","Emma"
"16349",158,"Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly","Emma"
"16350",158,"remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet","Emma"
"16351",158,"steady voice,","Emma"
"16352",158,"","Emma"
"16353",158,"“How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!—They _will_","Emma"

"16358",158,"Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she","Emma"
"16359",158,"felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill, and really","Emma"
"16360",158,"regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never been more","Emma"
"16361",158,"sensible of Mr. Knightley’s high superiority of character. The","Emma"

"16370",158,"","Emma"
"16371",158,"If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a","Emma"
"16372",158,"momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her","Emma"
"16373",158,"attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from","Emma"
"16374",158,"unbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from the","Emma"
"16375",158,"recurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought the party","Emma"
"16376",158,"from London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour","Emma"
"16377",158,"alone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied—unaccountable","Emma"
"16378",158,"as it was!—that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,","Emma"
"16379",158,"and was now forming all her views of happiness.","Emma"
"16380",158,"","Emma"
"16381",158,"Harriet was a little distressed—did look a little foolish at first: but","Emma"
"16382",158,"having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and","Emma"
"16383",158,"self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with","Emma"
"16384",158,"the words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the","Emma"
"16385",158,"fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend’s","Emma"
"16386",158,"approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by","Emma"
"16387",158,"meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.—Harriet was most","Emma"
"16388",158,"happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley’s, and the","Emma"
"16389",158,"dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.","Emma"
"16390",158,"But what did such particulars explain?—The fact was, as Emma could now","Emma"
"16391",158,"acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his","Emma"
"16392",158,"continuing to love her had been irresistible.—Beyond this, it must ever","Emma"
"16393",158,"be unintelligible to Emma.","Emma"
"16394",158,"","Emma"
"16395",158,"The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh","Emma"
"16396",158,"reason for thinking so.—Harriet’s parentage became known. She proved to","Emma"
"16397",158,"be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the","Emma"
"16398",158,"comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to","Emma"
"16399",158,"have always wished for concealment.—Such was the blood of gentility","Emma"
"16400",158,"which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!—It was likely to be","Emma"
"16401",158,"as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what a","Emma"
"16402",158,"connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley—or for the","Emma"
"16403",158,"Churchills—or even for Mr. Elton!—The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached","Emma"
"16404",158,"by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.","Emma"
"16405",158,"","Emma"
"16406",158,"No objection was raised on the father’s side; the young man was treated","Emma"
"16407",158,"liberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted","Emma"
"16408",158,"with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fully","Emma"
"16409",158,"acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could","Emma"
"16410",158,"bid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt of Harriet’s","Emma"
"16411",158,"happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he","Emma"
"16412",158,"offered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and","Emma"
"16413",158,"improvement. She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her,","Emma"
"16414",158,"and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety, and","Emma"
"16415",158,"occupied enough for cheerfulness. She would be never led into","Emma"
"16416",158,"temptation, nor left for it to find her out. She would be respectable","Emma"
"16417",158,"and happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the","Emma"
"16418",158,"world, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a","Emma"
"16419",158,"man;—or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.","Emma"
"16420",158,"","Emma"
"16421",158,"Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,","Emma"
"16422",158,"was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.—The","Emma"
"16423",158,"intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change","Emma"
"16424",158,"into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be, and","Emma"
"16425",158,"must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural","Emma"
"16426",158,"manner.","Emma"
"16427",158,"","Emma"
"16428",158,"Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw","Emma"
"16429",158,"her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as","Emma"
"16430",158,"no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them,","Emma"
"16431",158,"could impair.—Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton,","Emma"
"16432",158,"but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on","Emma"
"16433",158,"herself.—Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged of","Emma"
"16434",158,"the three, were the first to be married.","Emma"
"16435",158,"","Emma"
"16436",158,"Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the","Emma"
"16437",158,"comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.—The Mr. Churchills","Emma"
"16438",158,"were also in town; and they were only waiting for November.","Emma"
"16439",158,"","Emma"
"16440",158,"The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by","Emma"
"16441",158,"Emma and Mr. Knightley.—They had determined that their marriage ought","Emma"
"16442",158,"to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to","Emma"
"16443",158,"allow them the fortnight’s absence in a tour to the seaside, which was","Emma"
"16444",158,"the plan.—John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in","Emma"
"16445",158,"approving it. But Mr. Woodhouse—how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced to","Emma"
"16446",158,"consent?—he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a","Emma"
"16447",158,"distant event.","Emma"
"16448",158,"","Emma"
"16449",158,"When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they were","Emma"
"16450",158,"almost hopeless.—A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.—He began to","Emma"
"16451",158,"think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it—a very promising","Emma"
"16452",158,"step of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, however, he was not","Emma"
"16453",158,"happy. Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughter’s courage","Emma"
"16454",158,"failed. She could not bear to see him suffering, to know him fancying","Emma"
"16455",158,"himself neglected; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in","Emma"
"16456",158,"the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that when once the event were","Emma"
"16457",158,"over, his distress would be soon over too, she hesitated—she could not","Emma"
"16458",158,"proceed.","Emma"
"16459",158,"","Emma"
"16460",158,"In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden","Emma"
"16461",158,"illumination of Mr. Woodhouse’s mind, or any wonderful change of his","Emma"
"16462",158,"nervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another","Emma"
"16463",158,"way.—Mrs. Weston’s poultry-house was robbed one night of all her","Emma"
"16464",158,"turkeys—evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards in the","Emma"
"16465",158,"neighbourhood also suffered.—Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr.","Emma"
"16466",158,"Woodhouse’s fears.—He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his","Emma"
"16467",158,"son-in-law’s protection, would have been under wretched alarm every","Emma"
"16468",158,"night of his life. The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of","Emma"
"16469",158,"the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. While either of","Emma"
"16470",158,"them protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.—But Mr. John Knightley","Emma"
"16471",158,"must be in London again by the end of the first week in November.","Emma"
"16472",158,"","Emma"
"16473",158,"The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,","Emma"
"16474",158,"cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the","Emma"
"16475",158,"moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day—and Mr. Elton was called","Emma"
"16476",158,"on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to","Emma"
"16477",158,"join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.","Emma"
"16478",158,"","Emma"
"16479",158,"The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have","Emma"
"16480",158,"no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars","Emma"
"16481",158,"detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very","Emma"
"16482",158,"inferior to her own.—“Very little white satin, very few lace veils; a","Emma"

"16904",1342,"      Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with","Pride and prejudice"
"16905",1342,"      him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of","Pride and prejudice"

"16907",1342,"      that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from","Pride and prejudice"

"16912",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"16913",1342,"      Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant","Pride and prejudice"
"16914",1342,"      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine","Pride and prejudice"
"16915",1342,"      women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"16916",1342,"      Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon","Pride and prejudice"
"16917",1342,"      drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome","Pride and prejudice"

"16930",1342,"      Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the","Pride and prejudice"

"16932",1342,"      danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and","Pride and prejudice"
"16933",1342,"      talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable","Pride and prejudice"
"16934",1342,"      qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him","Pride and prejudice"
"16935",1342,"      and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and","Pride and prejudice"
"16936",1342,"      once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other","Pride and prejudice"
"16937",1342,"      lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the","Pride and prejudice"
"16938",1342,"      room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His","Pride and prejudice"
"16939",1342,"      character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man","Pride and prejudice"
"16940",1342,"      in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there","Pride and prejudice"
"16941",1342,"      again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,","Pride and prejudice"

"16982",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"16983",1342,"      Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and","Pride and prejudice"

"16985",1342,"      told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for","Pride and prejudice"

"16990",1342,"      Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the","Pride and prejudice"
"16991",1342,"      Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she","Pride and prejudice"
"16992",1342,"      had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified","Pride and prejudice"
"16993",1342,"      by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.","Pride and prejudice"
"16994",1342,"      Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned","Pride and prejudice"
"16995",1342,"      to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the","Pride and prejudice"

"16997",1342,"      to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet","Pride and prejudice"
"16998",1342,"      learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good","Pride and prejudice"
"16999",1342,"      spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which","Pride and prejudice"
"17000",1342,"      they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still","Pride and prejudice"
"17001",1342,"      up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present","Pride and prejudice"
"17002",1342,"      occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an","Pride and prejudice"
"17003",1342,"      evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had","Pride and prejudice"
"17004",1342,"      rather hoped that all his wife’s views on the stranger would be","Pride and prejudice"

"17011",1342,"      Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her","Pride and prejudice"

"17013",1342,"      my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only","Pride and prejudice"
"17014",1342,"      creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all,","Pride and prejudice"
"17015",1342,"      he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her;","Pride and prejudice"
"17016",1342,"      but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,","Pride and prejudice"
"17017",1342,"      you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going","Pride and prejudice"
"17018",1342,"      down the dance. So he enquired who she was, and got introduced,","Pride and prejudice"
"17019",1342,"      and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with","Pride and prejudice"
"17020",1342,"      Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth","Pride and prejudice"

"17136",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"17137",1342,"      Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in","Pride and prejudice"
"17138",1342,"      spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to","Pride and prejudice"
"17139",1342,"      Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,","Pride and prejudice"
"17140",1342,"      though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,","Pride and prejudice"
"17141",1342,"      and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the","Pride and prejudice"
"17142",1342,"      strength of Darcy’s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and","Pride and prejudice"
"17143",1342,"      of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was","Pride and prejudice"
"17144",1342,"      the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was","Pride and prejudice"
"17145",1342,"      clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and","Pride and prejudice"
"17146",1342,"      fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.","Pride and prejudice"
"17147",1342,"      In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was","Pride and prejudice"

"17152",1342,"      sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with","Pride and prejudice"
"17153",1342,"      pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been","Pride and prejudice"
"17154",1342,"      most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no","Pride and prejudice"

"17156",1342,"      to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.","Pride and prejudice"
"17157",1342,"      Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom","Pride and prejudice"
"17158",1342,"      there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had","Pride and prejudice"
"17159",1342,"      felt the smallest interest, and from none received either","Pride and prejudice"

"17712",1342,"      had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were","Pride and prejudice"
"17713",1342,"      uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued","Pride and prejudice"

"17742",1342,"      Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,","Pride and prejudice"

"17775",1342,"      stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and","Pride and prejudice"
"17776",1342,"      finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary","Pride and prejudice"

"17781",1342,"      assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of","Pride and prejudice"

"17784",1342,"      to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that","Pride and prejudice"
"17785",1342,"      they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very","Pride and prejudice"
"17786",1342,"      politely by them; and in their brother’s manners there was","Pride and prejudice"
"17787",1342,"      something better than politeness; there was good humour and","Pride and prejudice"
"17788",1342,"      kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at","Pride and prejudice"
"17789",1342,"      all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy","Pride and prejudice"
"17790",1342,"      which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the","Pride and prejudice"

"17793",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"17794",1342,"      Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.","Pride and prejudice"
"17795",1342,"      Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and","Pride and prejudice"
"17796",1342,"      not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken","Pride and prejudice"
"17797",1342,"      to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the","Pride and prejudice"
"17798",1342,"      fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note","Pride and prejudice"
"17799",1342,"      how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her","Pride and prejudice"

"17801",1342,"      when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little","Pride and prejudice"

"17804",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"17805",1342,"      When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and","Pride and prejudice"
"17806",1342,"      Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much","Pride and prejudice"
"17807",1342,"      affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary","Pride and prejudice"
"17808",1342,"      came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be","Pride and prejudice"
"17809",1342,"      supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must","Pride and prejudice"
"17810",1342,"      endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,","Pride and prejudice"
"17811",1342,"      and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily,","Pride and prejudice"
"17812",1342,"      for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.","Pride and prejudice"
"17813",1342,"      Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other","Pride and prejudice"
"17814",1342,"      ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact","Pride and prejudice"

"17816",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"17817",1342,"      When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and","Pride and prejudice"
"17818",1342,"      very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,","Pride and prejudice"
"17819",1342,"      and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane","Pride and prejudice"
"17820",1342,"      testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was","Pride and prejudice"
"17821",1342,"      obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to","Pride and prejudice"
"17822",1342,"      remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully","Pride and prejudice"
"17823",1342,"      consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint","Pride and prejudice"

"17831",1342,"      At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past","Pride and prejudice"
"17832",1342,"      six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries","Pride and prejudice"
"17833",1342,"      which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of","Pride and prejudice"
"17834",1342,"      distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley’s, she","Pride and prejudice"
"17835",1342,"      could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means","Pride and prejudice"
"17836",1342,"      better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four","Pride and prejudice"
"17837",1342,"      times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a","Pride and prejudice"
"17838",1342,"      bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves;","Pride and prejudice"
"17839",1342,"      and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference","Pride and prejudice"

"17842",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"17843",1342,"      Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she","Pride and prejudice"
"17844",1342,"      could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was","Pride and prejudice"
"17845",1342,"      evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they","Pride and prejudice"
"17846",1342,"      prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed","Pride and prejudice"
"17847",1342,"      she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from","Pride and prejudice"
"17848",1342,"      any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister","Pride and prejudice"
"17849",1342,"      scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he","Pride and prejudice"
"17850",1342,"      was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at","Pride and prejudice"
"17851",1342,"      cards; who, when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout,","Pride and prejudice"
"17852",1342,"      had nothing to say to her.","Pride and prejudice"

"17855",1342,"      Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her","Pride and prejudice"
"17856",1342,"      manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride","Pride and prejudice"

"17858",1342,"      Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added,","Pride and prejudice"

"18622",1342,"      steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite","Pride and prejudice"
"18623",1342,"      congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he","Pride and prejudice"
"18624",1342,"      was “very glad;” but diffuseness and warmth remained for","Pride and prejudice"
"18625",1342,"      Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first","Pride and prejudice"
"18626",1342,"      half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer","Pride and prejudice"
"18627",1342,"      from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the","Pride and prejudice"
"18628",1342,"      other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the","Pride and prejudice"
"18629",1342,"      door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone","Pride and prejudice"
"18630",1342,"      else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with","Pride and prejudice"
"18631",1342,"      great delight.","Pride and prejudice"
"18632",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18633",1342,"      When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the","Pride and prejudice"
"18634",1342,"      card-table—but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence","Pride and prejudice"
"18635",1342,"      that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found","Pride and prejudice"
"18636",1342,"      even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one","Pride and prejudice"
"18637",1342,"      intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the","Pride and prejudice"
"18638",1342,"      subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to","Pride and prejudice"
"18639",1342,"      do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.","Pride and prejudice"
"18640",1342,"      Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst,","Pride and prejudice"
"18641",1342,"      principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings,","Pride and prejudice"
"18642",1342,"      joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss","Pride and prejudice"
"18643",1342,"      Bennet.","Pride and prejudice"
"18644",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18645",1342,"      Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching","Pride and prejudice"
"18646",1342,"      Mr. Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own;","Pride and prejudice"
"18647",1342,"      and she was perpetually either making some enquiry, or looking at","Pride and prejudice"
"18648",1342,"      his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he","Pride and prejudice"
"18649",1342,"      merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite","Pride and prejudice"
"18650",1342,"      exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which","Pride and prejudice"
"18651",1342,"      she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she","Pride and prejudice"
"18652",1342,"      gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it is to spend an","Pride and prejudice"
"18653",1342,"      evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment","Pride and prejudice"
"18654",1342,"      like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a","Pride and prejudice"
"18655",1342,"      book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I","Pride and prejudice"
"18656",1342,"      have not an excellent library.”","Pride and prejudice"
"18657",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18658",1342,"      No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her","Pride and prejudice"
"18659",1342,"      book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some","Pride and prejudice"
"18660",1342,"      amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss","Pride and prejudice"
"18661",1342,"      Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:","Pride and prejudice"
"18662",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18663",1342,"      “By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a","Pride and prejudice"
"18664",1342,"      dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on","Pride and prejudice"
"18665",1342,"      it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much","Pride and prejudice"
"18666",1342,"      mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be","Pride and prejudice"
"18667",1342,"      rather a punishment than a pleasure.”","Pride and prejudice"
"18668",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18669",1342,"      “If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he","Pride and prejudice"
"18670",1342,"      chooses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a","Pride and prejudice"
"18671",1342,"      settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup","Pride and prejudice"
"18672",1342,"      enough, I shall send round my cards.”","Pride and prejudice"
"18673",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18674",1342,"      “I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they","Pride and prejudice"
"18675",1342,"      were carried on in a different manner; but there is something","Pride and prejudice"
"18676",1342,"      insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It","Pride and prejudice"
"18677",1342,"      would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of","Pride and prejudice"
"18678",1342,"      dancing were made the order of the day.”","Pride and prejudice"
"18679",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18680",1342,"      “Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would","Pride and prejudice"
"18681",1342,"      not be near so much like a ball.”","Pride and prejudice"
"18682",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18683",1342,"      Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and","Pride and prejudice"
"18684",1342,"      walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked","Pride and prejudice"
"18685",1342,"      well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly","Pride and prejudice"
"18686",1342,"      studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one","Pride and prejudice"
"18687",1342,"      effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:","Pride and prejudice"
"18688",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18689",1342,"      “Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and","Pride and prejudice"
"18690",1342,"      take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing","Pride and prejudice"
"18691",1342,"      after sitting so long in one attitude.”","Pride and prejudice"
"18692",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18693",1342,"      Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss","Pride and prejudice"
"18694",1342,"      Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"18695",1342,"      Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention","Pride and prejudice"
"18696",1342,"      in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously","Pride and prejudice"
"18697",1342,"      closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but","Pride and prejudice"
"18698",1342,"      he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives","Pride and prejudice"
"18699",1342,"      for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with","Pride and prejudice"
"18700",1342,"      either of which motives his joining them would interfere. “What","Pride and prejudice"
"18701",1342,"      could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his","Pride and prejudice"
"18702",1342,"      meaning?”—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand","Pride and prejudice"
"18703",1342,"      him?","Pride and prejudice"
"18704",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18705",1342,"      “Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be","Pride and prejudice"
"18706",1342,"      severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to","Pride and prejudice"
"18707",1342,"      ask nothing about it.”","Pride and prejudice"
"18708",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18709",1342,"      Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy","Pride and prejudice"
"18710",1342,"      in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation","Pride and prejudice"
"18711",1342,"      of his two motives.","Pride and prejudice"
"18712",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18713",1342,"      “I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he,","Pride and prejudice"
"18714",1342,"      as soon as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this","Pride and prejudice"
"18715",1342,"      method of passing the evening because you are in each other’s","Pride and prejudice"
"18716",1342,"      confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you","Pride and prejudice"
"18717",1342,"      are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage","Pride and prejudice"
"18718",1342,"      in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and","Pride and prejudice"
"18719",1342,"      if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the","Pride and prejudice"
"18720",1342,"      fire.”","Pride and prejudice"
"18721",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18722",1342,"      “Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so","Pride and prejudice"
"18723",1342,"      abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”","Pride and prejudice"
"18724",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18725",1342,"      “Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said","Pride and prejudice"
"18726",1342,"      Elizabeth. “We can all plague and punish one another. Tease","Pride and prejudice"

"18736",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18737",1342,"      “Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an","Pride and prejudice"
"18738",1342,"      uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it","Pride and prejudice"
"18739",1342,"      would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I","Pride and prejudice"

"18741",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18742",1342,"      “Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be.","Pride and prejudice"

"18746",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"18747",1342,"      “Certainly,” replied Elizabeth—“there are such people, but I hope","Pride and prejudice"

"18749",1342,"      good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_","Pride and prejudice"
"18750",1342,"      divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these,","Pride and prejudice"

"18819",1342,"      Elizabeth was positively resolved—nor did she much expect it","Pride and prejudice"

"18821",1342,"      as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow","Pride and prejudice"

"18827",1342,"      was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day","Pride and prejudice"

"18829",1342,"      Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for","Pride and prejudice"

"19298",1342,"      with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had","Pride and prejudice"
"19299",1342,"      accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it","Pride and prejudice"
"19300",1342,"      should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him","Pride and prejudice"

"19302",1342,"      had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good","Pride and prejudice"
"19303",1342,"      figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed","Pride and prejudice"
"19304",1342,"      up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness","Pride and prejudice"
"19305",1342,"      at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole","Pride and prejudice"
"19306",1342,"      party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,","Pride and prejudice"
"19307",1342,"      when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley","Pride and prejudice"

"19310",1342,"      began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman,","Pride and prejudice"
"19311",1342,"      and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on","Pride and prejudice"
"19312",1342,"      his way to Longbourn on purpose to enquire after her. Mr. Darcy","Pride and prejudice"
"19313",1342,"      corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to","Pride and prejudice"
"19314",1342,"      fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by","Pride and prejudice"
"19315",1342,"      the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the","Pride and prejudice"
"19316",1342,"      countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all","Pride and prejudice"
"19317",1342,"      astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,","Pride and prejudice"
"19318",1342,"      one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few","Pride and prejudice"
"19319",1342,"      moments, touched his hat—a salutation which Mr. Darcy just","Pride and prejudice"
"19320",1342,"      deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was","Pride and prejudice"
"19321",1342,"      impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.","Pride and prejudice"
"19322",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"19323",1342,"      In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have","Pride and prejudice"

"19375",1342,"      that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a","Pride and prejudice"
"19376",1342,"      more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the","Pride and prejudice"

"19819",1342,"      Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer","Pride and prejudice"
"19820",1342,"      when the affair became public.","Pride and prejudice"
"19821",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"19822",1342,"      The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this","Pride and prejudice"
"19823",1342,"      conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom","Pride and prejudice"
"19824",1342,"      they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give","Pride and prejudice"
"19825",1342,"      their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at","Pride and prejudice"
"19826",1342,"      Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two","Pride and prejudice"
"19827",1342,"      ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it","Pride and prejudice"
"19828",1342,"      an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been","Pride and prejudice"
"19829",1342,"      doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the","Pride and prejudice"
"19830",1342,"      family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much","Pride and prejudice"
"19831",1342,"      as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to","Pride and prejudice"
"19832",1342,"      the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats","Pride and prejudice"
"19833",1342,"      with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and","Pride and prejudice"
"19834",1342,"      hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.","Pride and prejudice"
"19835",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"19836",1342,"      The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to","Pride and prejudice"
"19837",1342,"      every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as","Pride and prejudice"
"19838",1342,"      given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly","Pride and prejudice"
"19839",1342,"      flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself,","Pride and prejudice"
"19840",1342,"      instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy","Pride and prejudice"
"19841",1342,"      evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of","Pride and prejudice"
"19842",1342,"      their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a","Pride and prejudice"
"19843",1342,"      great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of","Pride and prejudice"
"19844",1342,"      everything in Mr. Darcy’s look and behaviour. The happiness","Pride and prejudice"
"19845",1342,"      anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single","Pride and prejudice"
"19846",1342,"      event, or any particular person, for though they each, like","Pride and prejudice"
"19847",1342,"      Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he","Pride and prejudice"
"19848",1342,"      was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a","Pride and prejudice"
"19849",1342,"      ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her","Pride and prejudice"
"19850",1342,"      family that she had no disinclination for it.","Pride and prejudice"
"19851",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"19852",1342,"      “While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is","Pride and prejudice"
"19853",1342,"      enough—I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening","Pride and prejudice"
"19854",1342,"      engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself","Pride and prejudice"
"19855",1342,"      one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement","Pride and prejudice"

"19857",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"19858",1342,"      Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though","Pride and prejudice"
"19859",1342,"      she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could","Pride and prejudice"
"19860",1342,"      not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s","Pride and prejudice"
"19861",1342,"      invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to","Pride and prejudice"
"19862",1342,"      join in the evening’s amusement; and she was rather surprised to","Pride and prejudice"
"19863",1342,"      find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and","Pride and prejudice"
"19864",1342,"      was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop,","Pride and prejudice"
"19865",1342,"      or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.","Pride and prejudice"
"19866",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"19867",1342,"      “I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a","Pride and prejudice"
"19868",1342,"      ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to","Pride and prejudice"
"19869",1342,"      respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far","Pride and prejudice"
"19870",1342,"      from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be","Pride and prejudice"
"19871",1342,"      honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of","Pride and prejudice"
"19872",1342,"      the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours,","Pride and prejudice"
"19873",1342,"      Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference","Pride and prejudice"
"19874",1342,"      which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause,","Pride and prejudice"
"19875",1342,"      and not to any disrespect for her.”","Pride and prejudice"
"19876",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"19877",1342,"      Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully","Pride and prejudice"
"19878",1342,"      proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and","Pride and prejudice"
"19879",1342,"      to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse","Pride and prejudice"
"19880",1342,"      timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness","Pride and prejudice"
"19881",1342,"      and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"19882",1342,"      Collins’s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.","Pride and prejudice"
"19883",1342,"      She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea","Pride and prejudice"
"19884",1342,"      it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that","Pride and prejudice"
"19885",1342,"      _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being","Pride and prejudice"
"19886",1342,"      mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a","Pride and prejudice"
"19887",1342,"      quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible","Pride and prejudice"
"19888",1342,"      visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed","Pride and prejudice"
"19889",1342,"      his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent","Pride and prejudice"
"19890",1342,"      attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more","Pride and prejudice"
"19891",1342,"      astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms,","Pride and prejudice"
"19892",1342,"      it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the","Pride and prejudice"
"19893",1342,"      probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to _her_.","Pride and prejudice"
"19894",1342,"      Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well","Pride and prejudice"
"19895",1342,"      aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any","Pride and prejudice"
"19896",1342,"      reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did,","Pride and prejudice"
"19897",1342,"      it was useless to quarrel about him.","Pride and prejudice"

"19900",1342,"      of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable","Pride and prejudice"
"19901",1342,"      state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the","Pride and prejudice"
"19902",1342,"      day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented","Pride and prejudice"
"19903",1342,"      their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news","Pride and prejudice"
"19904",1342,"      could be sought after—the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were","Pride and prejudice"
"19905",1342,"      got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her","Pride and prejudice"
"19906",1342,"      patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of","Pride and prejudice"

"19908",1342,"      on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and","Pride and prejudice"

"19917",1342,"      looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats","Pride and prejudice"
"19918",1342,"      there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred","Pride and prejudice"

"19920",1342,"      of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed","Pride and prejudice"
"19921",1342,"      her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in","Pride and prejudice"

"19927",1342,"      this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence","Pride and prejudice"
"19928",1342,"      was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly","Pride and prejudice"
"19929",1342,"      applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to","Pride and prejudice"
"19930",1342,"      town on business the day before, and was not yet returned;","Pride and prejudice"
"19931",1342,"      adding, with a significant smile, “I do not imagine his business","Pride and prejudice"

"19934",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"19935",1342,"      This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was","Pride and prejudice"
"19936",1342,"      caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not","Pride and prejudice"
"19937",1342,"      less answerable for Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise","Pride and prejudice"
"19938",1342,"      had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former","Pride and prejudice"
"19939",1342,"      was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could","Pride and prejudice"
"19940",1342,"      hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries","Pride and prejudice"
"19941",1342,"      which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance,","Pride and prejudice"
"19942",1342,"      forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was","Pride and prejudice"
"19943",1342,"      resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned","Pride and prejudice"
"19944",1342,"      away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly","Pride and prejudice"
"19945",1342,"      surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality","Pride and prejudice"

"19947",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"19948",1342,"      But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every","Pride and prejudice"

"19951",1342,"      Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon","Pride and prejudice"
"19952",1342,"      able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her","Pride and prejudice"
"19953",1342,"      cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first","Pride and prejudice"
"19954",1342,"      two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were","Pride and prejudice"
"19955",1342,"      dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,","Pride and prejudice"
"19956",1342,"      apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without","Pride and prejudice"
"19957",1342,"      being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a","Pride and prejudice"
"19958",1342,"      disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment","Pride and prejudice"
"19959",1342,"      of her release from him was ecstasy.","Pride and prejudice"
"19960",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"19961",1342,"      She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of","Pride and prejudice"
"19962",1342,"      talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.","Pride and prejudice"
"19963",1342,"      When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and","Pride and prejudice"
"19964",1342,"      was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly","Pride and prejudice"
"19965",1342,"      addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his","Pride and prejudice"
"19966",1342,"      application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she","Pride and prejudice"
"19967",1342,"      accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left","Pride and prejudice"
"19968",1342,"      to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to","Pride and prejudice"
"19969",1342,"      console her:","Pride and prejudice"
"19970",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"19971",1342,"      “I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”","Pride and prejudice"
"19972",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"19973",1342,"      “Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!","Pride and prejudice"
"19974",1342,"      To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not","Pride and prejudice"

"19976",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"19977",1342,"      When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to","Pride and prejudice"
"19978",1342,"      claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a","Pride and prejudice"
"19979",1342,"      whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham","Pride and prejudice"
"19980",1342,"      to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his","Pride and prejudice"
"19981",1342,"      consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the","Pride and prejudice"
"19982",1342,"      set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being","Pride and prejudice"
"19983",1342,"      allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her","Pride and prejudice"
"19984",1342,"      neighbours’ looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They","Pride and prejudice"
"19985",1342,"      stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to","Pride and prejudice"
"19986",1342,"      imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances,","Pride and prejudice"
"19987",1342,"      and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying","Pride and prejudice"
"19988",1342,"      that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige","Pride and prejudice"
"19989",1342,"      him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He","Pride and prejudice"
"19990",1342,"      replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she","Pride and prejudice"
"19991",1342,"      addressed him a second time with:—“It is _your_ turn to say","Pride and prejudice"
"19992",1342,"      something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the dance, and _you_","Pride and prejudice"
"19993",1342,"      ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the","Pride and prejudice"

"19995",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"19996",1342,"      He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say","Pride and prejudice"
"19997",1342,"      should be said.","Pride and prejudice"
"19998",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"19999",1342,"      “Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by","Pride and prejudice"
"20000",1342,"      I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public","Pride and prejudice"

"20006",1342,"      to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the","Pride and prejudice"
"20007",1342,"      advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as","Pride and prejudice"
"20008",1342,"      that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20009",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20010",1342,"      “Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do","Pride and prejudice"
"20011",1342,"      you imagine that you are gratifying mine?”","Pride and prejudice"
"20012",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20013",1342,"      “Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great","Pride and prejudice"
"20014",1342,"      similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,","Pride and prejudice"
"20015",1342,"      taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say","Pride and prejudice"
"20016",1342,"      something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to","Pride and prejudice"
"20017",1342,"      posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20018",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20019",1342,"      “This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am","Pride and prejudice"
"20020",1342,"      sure,” said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend","Pride and prejudice"
"20021",1342,"      to say. _You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20022",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"

"20024",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20025",1342,"      He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone","Pride and prejudice"
"20026",1342,"      down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not","Pride and prejudice"
"20027",1342,"      very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and,","Pride and prejudice"
"20028",1342,"      unable to resist the temptation, added, “When you met us there","Pride and prejudice"
"20029",1342,"      the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20030",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20031",1342,"      The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread","Pride and prejudice"
"20032",1342,"      his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though","Pride and prejudice"
"20033",1342,"      blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length","Pride and prejudice"
"20034",1342,"      Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, “Mr. Wickham is","Pride and prejudice"
"20035",1342,"      blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_","Pride and prejudice"
"20036",1342,"      friends—whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is","Pride and prejudice"
"20037",1342,"      less certain.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20038",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20039",1342,"      “He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,” replied","Pride and prejudice"
"20040",1342,"      Elizabeth with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to","Pride and prejudice"

"20042",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20043",1342,"      Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the","Pride and prejudice"
"20044",1342,"      subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to","Pride and prejudice"
"20045",1342,"      them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the","Pride and prejudice"

"20050",1342,"      “I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very","Pride and prejudice"

"20057",1342,"      Mr. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank","Pride and prejudice"

"20062",1342,"      Sir William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him","Pride and prejudice"
"20063",1342,"      forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious","Pride and prejudice"

"20093",1342,"      that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very","Pride and prejudice"

"20135",1342,"      “So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George","Pride and prejudice"
"20136",1342,"      Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking","Pride and prejudice"
"20137",1342,"      me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite","Pride and prejudice"
"20138",1342,"      forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was","Pride and prejudice"
"20139",1342,"      the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy’s steward. Let me","Pride and prejudice"
"20140",1342,"      recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit","Pride and prejudice"
"20141",1342,"      confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy’s using him","Pride and prejudice"
"20142",1342,"      ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always","Pride and prejudice"
"20143",1342,"      been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated","Pride and prejudice"
"20144",1342,"      Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the","Pride and prejudice"
"20145",1342,"      particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the","Pride and prejudice"
"20146",1342,"      least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham","Pride and prejudice"
"20147",1342,"      mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not","Pride and prejudice"
"20148",1342,"      well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he","Pride and prejudice"
"20149",1342,"      was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the","Pride and prejudice"
"20150",1342,"      way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing,","Pride and prejudice"
"20151",1342,"      indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,","Pride and prejudice"
"20152",1342,"      Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but","Pride and prejudice"
"20153",1342,"      really, considering his descent, one could not expect much","Pride and prejudice"
"20154",1342,"      better.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20155",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20156",1342,"      “His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the","Pride and prejudice"
"20157",1342,"      same,” said Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him","Pride and prejudice"
"20158",1342,"      of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward,","Pride and prejudice"
"20159",1342,"      and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20160",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20161",1342,"      “I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a","Pride and prejudice"

"20163",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20164",1342,"      “Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much","Pride and prejudice"
"20165",1342,"      mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as","Pride and prejudice"
"20166",1342,"      this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the","Pride and prejudice"
"20167",1342,"      malice of Mr. Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had","Pride and prejudice"
"20168",1342,"      undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane","Pride and prejudice"
"20169",1342,"      met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such","Pride and prejudice"
"20170",1342,"      happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was","Pride and prejudice"
"20171",1342,"      satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth","Pride and prejudice"
"20172",1342,"      instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for","Pride and prejudice"
"20173",1342,"      Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else,","Pride and prejudice"
"20174",1342,"      gave way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for","Pride and prejudice"

"20176",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20177",1342,"      “I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling","Pride and prejudice"
"20178",1342,"      than her sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But","Pride and prejudice"
"20179",1342,"      perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any","Pride and prejudice"
"20180",1342,"      third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20181",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20182",1342,"      “No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing","Pride and prejudice"
"20183",1342,"      satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of","Pride and prejudice"
"20184",1342,"      his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which","Pride and prejudice"
"20185",1342,"      have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the","Pride and prejudice"
"20186",1342,"      good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is","Pride and prejudice"
"20187",1342,"      perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less","Pride and prejudice"
"20188",1342,"      attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to","Pride and prejudice"
"20189",1342,"      say by his account as well as his sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no","Pride and prejudice"
"20190",1342,"      means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very","Pride and prejudice"
"20191",1342,"      imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s regard.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20192",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20193",1342,"      “Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”","Pride and prejudice"
"20194",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20195",1342,"      “No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20196",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20197",1342,"      “This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am","Pride and prejudice"
"20198",1342,"      satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”","Pride and prejudice"
"20199",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20200",1342,"      “He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has","Pride and prejudice"
"20201",1342,"      heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it","Pride and prejudice"
"20202",1342,"      was left to him _conditionally_ only.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20203",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20204",1342,"      “I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth","Pride and prejudice"
"20205",1342,"      warmly; “but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances","Pride and prejudice"
"20206",1342,"      only. Mr. Bingley’s defense of his friend was a very able one, I","Pride and prejudice"
"20207",1342,"      dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the","Pride and prejudice"
"20208",1342,"      story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall","Pride and prejudice"
"20209",1342,"      venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20210",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20211",1342,"      She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,","Pride and prejudice"
"20212",1342,"      and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth","Pride and prejudice"
"20213",1342,"      listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which","Pride and prejudice"
"20214",1342,"      Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley’s regard, and said all in her","Pride and prejudice"
"20215",1342,"      power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by","Pride and prejudice"
"20216",1342,"      Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose","Pride and prejudice"
"20217",1342,"      enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had","Pride and prejudice"
"20218",1342,"      scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told","Pride and prejudice"
"20219",1342,"      her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as","Pride and prejudice"
"20220",1342,"      to make a most important discovery.","Pride and prejudice"
"20221",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20222",1342,"      “I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there","Pride and prejudice"
"20223",1342,"      is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to","Pride and prejudice"
"20224",1342,"      overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who","Pride and prejudice"
"20225",1342,"      does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de","Pride and prejudice"
"20226",1342,"      Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these","Pride and prejudice"
"20227",1342,"      sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with,","Pride and prejudice"
"20228",1342,"      perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I","Pride and prejudice"
"20229",1342,"      am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay","Pride and prejudice"
"20230",1342,"      my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will","Pride and prejudice"
"20231",1342,"      excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the","Pride and prejudice"
"20232",1342,"      connection must plead my apology.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20233",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20234",1342,"      “You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!”","Pride and prejudice"
"20235",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20236",1342,"      “Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it","Pride and prejudice"
"20237",1342,"      earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will","Pride and prejudice"
"20238",1342,"      be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well","Pride and prejudice"
"20239",1342,"      yesterday se’nnight.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20240",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20241",1342,"      Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring","Pride and prejudice"
"20242",1342,"      him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without","Pride and prejudice"
"20243",1342,"      introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment","Pride and prejudice"
"20244",1342,"      to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should","Pride and prejudice"
"20245",1342,"      be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong","Pride and prejudice"
"20246",1342,"      to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the","Pride and prejudice"
"20247",1342,"      acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air","Pride and prejudice"
"20248",1342,"      of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking,","Pride and prejudice"
"20249",1342,"      replied thus:","Pride and prejudice"
"20250",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20251",1342,"      “My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world","Pride and prejudice"
"20252",1342,"      in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of","Pride and prejudice"
"20253",1342,"      your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a","Pride and prejudice"
"20254",1342,"      wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst","Pride and prejudice"
"20255",1342,"      the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me","Pride and prejudice"
"20256",1342,"      leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in","Pride and prejudice"
"20257",1342,"      point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided","Pride and prejudice"
"20258",1342,"      that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time","Pride and prejudice"
"20259",1342,"      maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of","Pride and prejudice"
"20260",1342,"      my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I","Pride and prejudice"
"20261",1342,"      look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by","Pride and prejudice"
"20262",1342,"      your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant","Pride and prejudice"
"20263",1342,"      guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted","Pride and prejudice"
"20264",1342,"      by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a","Pride and prejudice"
"20265",1342,"      young lady like yourself.” And with a low bow he left her to","Pride and prejudice"
"20266",1342,"      attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly","Pride and prejudice"
"20267",1342,"      watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very","Pride and prejudice"
"20268",1342,"      evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and","Pride and prejudice"
"20269",1342,"      though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it","Pride and prejudice"
"20270",1342,"      all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”","Pride and prejudice"
"20271",1342,"      “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see","Pride and prejudice"
"20272",1342,"      him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with","Pride and prejudice"
"20273",1342,"      unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him","Pride and prejudice"
"20274",1342,"      time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"20275",1342,"      Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and","Pride and prejudice"
"20276",1342,"      Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length","Pride and prejudice"
"20277",1342,"      of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a","Pride and prejudice"
"20278",1342,"      slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to","Pride and prejudice"
"20279",1342,"      Elizabeth.","Pride and prejudice"
"20280",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20281",1342,"      “I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied","Pride and prejudice"
"20282",1342,"      with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the","Pride and prejudice"
"20283",1342,"      attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid","Pride and prejudice"
"20284",1342,"      me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady","Pride and prejudice"
"20285",1342,"      Catherine’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a","Pride and prejudice"
"20286",1342,"      favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon","Pride and prejudice"
"20287",1342,"      the whole, I am much pleased with him.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20288",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20289",1342,"      As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she","Pride and prejudice"
"20290",1342,"      turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"20291",1342,"      Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her","Pride and prejudice"
"20292",1342,"      observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as","Pride and prejudice"
"20293",1342,"      Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the","Pride and prejudice"
"20294",1342,"      felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she","Pride and prejudice"
"20295",1342,"      felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to","Pride and prejudice"
"20296",1342,"      like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly saw","Pride and prejudice"
"20297",1342,"      were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near","Pride and prejudice"
"20298",1342,"      her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper,","Pride and prejudice"
"20299",1342,"      therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which","Pride and prejudice"
"20300",1342,"      placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to","Pride and prejudice"
"20301",1342,"      find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas)","Pride and prejudice"
"20302",1342,"      freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane","Pride and prejudice"
"20303",1342,"      would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating","Pride and prejudice"
"20304",1342,"      subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while","Pride and prejudice"
"20305",1342,"      enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a","Pride and prejudice"
"20306",1342,"      charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from","Pride and prejudice"
"20307",1342,"      them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was","Pride and prejudice"
"20308",1342,"      such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane,","Pride and prejudice"
"20309",1342,"      and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as","Pride and prejudice"
"20310",1342,"      she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her","Pride and prejudice"
"20311",1342,"      younger daughters, as Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them","Pride and prejudice"
"20312",1342,"      in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at","Pride and prejudice"
"20313",1342,"      her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to","Pride and prejudice"
"20314",1342,"      the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go","Pride and prejudice"
"20315",1342,"      into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this","Pride and prejudice"
"20316",1342,"      circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it","Pride and prejudice"
"20317",1342,"      is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to","Pride and prejudice"
"20318",1342,"      find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She","Pride and prejudice"
"20319",1342,"      concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be","Pride and prejudice"
"20320",1342,"      equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing","Pride and prejudice"
"20321",1342,"      there was no chance of it.","Pride and prejudice"
"20322",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20323",1342,"      In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her","Pride and prejudice"
"20324",1342,"      mother’s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a","Pride and prejudice"
"20325",1342,"      less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she","Pride and prejudice"
"20326",1342,"      could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy,","Pride and prejudice"
"20327",1342,"      who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being","Pride and prejudice"
"20328",1342,"      nonsensical.","Pride and prejudice"
"20329",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20330",1342,"      “What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I","Pride and prejudice"
"20331",1342,"      am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged","Pride and prejudice"
"20332",1342,"      to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20333",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20334",1342,"      “For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be","Pride and prejudice"
"20335",1342,"      for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to","Pride and prejudice"
"20336",1342,"      his friend by so doing!”","Pride and prejudice"
"20337",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20338",1342,"      Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her","Pride and prejudice"
"20339",1342,"      mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.","Pride and prejudice"
"20340",1342,"      Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She","Pride and prejudice"
"20341",1342,"      could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though","Pride and prejudice"
"20342",1342,"      every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was","Pride and prejudice"
"20343",1342,"      not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his","Pride and prejudice"
"20344",1342,"      attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face","Pride and prejudice"
"20345",1342,"      changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and","Pride and prejudice"
"20346",1342,"      steady gravity.","Pride and prejudice"
"20347",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20348",1342,"      At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady","Pride and prejudice"
"20349",1342,"      Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights","Pride and prejudice"
"20350",1342,"      which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts","Pride and prejudice"
"20351",1342,"      of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not","Pride and prejudice"
"20352",1342,"      long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over,","Pride and prejudice"
"20353",1342,"      singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing","Pride and prejudice"
"20354",1342,"      Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the","Pride and prejudice"
"20355",1342,"      company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she","Pride and prejudice"
"20356",1342,"      endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain;","Pride and prejudice"
"20357",1342,"      Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting","Pride and prejudice"
"20358",1342,"      was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth’s eyes","Pride and prejudice"
"20359",1342,"      were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched","Pride and prejudice"
"20360",1342,"      her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which","Pride and prejudice"
"20361",1342,"      was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving,","Pride and prejudice"
"20362",1342,"      amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she","Pride and prejudice"
"20363",1342,"      might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of","Pride and prejudice"
"20364",1342,"      half a minute began another. Mary’s powers were by no means","Pride and prejudice"
"20365",1342,"      fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner","Pride and prejudice"
"20366",1342,"      affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see","Pride and prejudice"
"20367",1342,"      how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.","Pride and prejudice"
"20368",1342,"      She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of","Pride and prejudice"
"20369",1342,"      derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,","Pride and prejudice"
"20370",1342,"      imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his","Pride and prejudice"
"20371",1342,"      interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the","Pride and prejudice"
"20372",1342,"      hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,","Pride and prejudice"
"20373",1342,"      “That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long","Pride and prejudice"
"20374",1342,"      enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20375",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20376",1342,"      Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted;","Pride and prejudice"
"20377",1342,"      and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech,","Pride and prejudice"
"20378",1342,"      was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were","Pride and prejudice"
"20379",1342,"      now applied to.","Pride and prejudice"
"20380",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20381",1342,"      “If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to","Pride and prejudice"
"20382",1342,"      sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the","Pride and prejudice"
"20383",1342,"      company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent","Pride and prejudice"
"20384",1342,"      diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a","Pride and prejudice"
"20385",1342,"      clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be","Pride and prejudice"
"20386",1342,"      justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there","Pride and prejudice"
"20387",1342,"      are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a","Pride and prejudice"
"20388",1342,"      parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an","Pride and prejudice"
"20389",1342,"      agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not","Pride and prejudice"
"20390",1342,"      offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the","Pride and prejudice"
"20391",1342,"      time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and","Pride and prejudice"
"20392",1342,"      the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be","Pride and prejudice"
"20393",1342,"      excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not","Pride and prejudice"
"20394",1342,"      think it of light importance that he should have attentive and","Pride and prejudice"
"20395",1342,"      conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those","Pride and prejudice"
"20396",1342,"      to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty;","Pride and prejudice"
"20397",1342,"      nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of","Pride and prejudice"
"20398",1342,"      testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the","Pride and prejudice"
"20399",1342,"      family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,","Pride and prejudice"
"20400",1342,"      which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.","Pride and prejudice"
"20401",1342,"      Many stared—many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"20402",1342,"      Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins","Pride and prejudice"
"20403",1342,"      for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to","Pride and prejudice"
"20404",1342,"      Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young","Pride and prejudice"
"20405",1342,"      man.","Pride and prejudice"
"20406",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20407",1342,"      To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement","Pride and prejudice"
"20408",1342,"      to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it","Pride and prejudice"
"20409",1342,"      would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more","Pride and prejudice"
"20410",1342,"      spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley","Pride and prejudice"
"20411",1342,"      and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his","Pride and prejudice"
"20412",1342,"      notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much","Pride and prejudice"
"20413",1342,"      distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his","Pride and prejudice"
"20414",1342,"      two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an","Pride and prejudice"
"20415",1342,"      opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she","Pride and prejudice"
"20416",1342,"      could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman,","Pride and prejudice"
"20417",1342,"      or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.","Pride and prejudice"
"20418",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20419",1342,"      The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was","Pride and prejudice"
"20420",1342,"      teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her","Pride and prejudice"
"20421",1342,"      side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him","Pride and prejudice"
"20422",1342,"      again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did","Pride and prejudice"
"20423",1342,"      she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to","Pride and prejudice"
"20424",1342,"      introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her, that","Pride and prejudice"
"20425",1342,"      as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief","Pride and prejudice"
"20426",1342,"      object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and","Pride and prejudice"
"20427",1342,"      that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her","Pride and prejudice"
"20428",1342,"      the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She","Pride and prejudice"
"20429",1342,"      owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often","Pride and prejudice"
"20430",1342,"      joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s","Pride and prejudice"
"20431",1342,"      conversation to herself.","Pride and prejudice"
"20432",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20433",1342,"      She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy’s further","Pride and prejudice"
"20434",1342,"      notice; though often standing within a very short distance of","Pride and prejudice"
"20435",1342,"      her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She","Pride and prejudice"
"20436",1342,"      felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"20437",1342,"      Wickham, and rejoiced in it.","Pride and prejudice"
"20438",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20439",1342,"      The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart,","Pride and prejudice"
"20440",1342,"      and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their","Pride and prejudice"
"20441",1342,"      carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone,","Pride and prejudice"
"20442",1342,"      which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by","Pride and prejudice"
"20443",1342,"      some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened","Pride and prejudice"
"20444",1342,"      their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently","Pride and prejudice"
"20445",1342,"      impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every","Pride and prejudice"
"20446",1342,"      attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a","Pride and prejudice"
"20447",1342,"      languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by","Pride and prejudice"
"20448",1342,"      the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"20449",1342,"      Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment,","Pride and prejudice"
"20450",1342,"      and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their","Pride and prejudice"
"20451",1342,"      behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet,","Pride and prejudice"
"20452",1342,"      in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane","Pride and prejudice"
"20453",1342,"      were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and","Pride and prejudice"
"20454",1342,"      talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a","Pride and prejudice"
"20455",1342,"      silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was","Pride and prejudice"
"20456",1342,"      too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation","Pride and prejudice"
"20457",1342,"      of “Lord, how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.","Pride and prejudice"
"20458",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20459",1342,"      When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most","Pride and prejudice"
"20460",1342,"      pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at","Pride and prejudice"
"20461",1342,"      Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to","Pride and prejudice"
"20462",1342,"      assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner","Pride and prejudice"
"20463",1342,"      with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal","Pride and prejudice"
"20464",1342,"      invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily","Pride and prejudice"
"20465",1342,"      engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her,","Pride and prejudice"
"20466",1342,"      after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the","Pride and prejudice"
"20467",1342,"      next day for a short time.","Pride and prejudice"
"20468",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20469",1342,"      Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under","Pride and prejudice"
"20470",1342,"      the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary","Pride and prejudice"
"20471",1342,"      preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes,","Pride and prejudice"
"20472",1342,"      she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in","Pride and prejudice"
"20473",1342,"      the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter","Pride and prejudice"
"20474",1342,"      married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and","Pride and prejudice"
"20475",1342,"      with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the","Pride and prejudice"
"20476",1342,"      least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the","Pride and prejudice"
"20477",1342,"      match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was","Pride and prejudice"
"20478",1342,"      eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.","Pride and prejudice"
"20479",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"

"20484",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20485",1342,"      The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made","Pride and prejudice"
"20486",1342,"      his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of","Pride and prejudice"
"20487",1342,"      time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following","Pride and prejudice"
"20488",1342,"      Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it","Pride and prejudice"
"20489",1342,"      distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a","Pride and prejudice"
"20490",1342,"      very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed","Pride and prejudice"
"20491",1342,"      a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet,","Pride and prejudice"
"20492",1342,"      Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after","Pride and prejudice"
"20493",1342,"      breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:","Pride and prejudice"
"20494",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20495",1342,"      “May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter","Pride and prejudice"
"20496",1342,"      Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience","Pride and prejudice"
"20497",1342,"      with her in the course of this morning?”","Pride and prejudice"
"20498",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20499",1342,"      Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise,","Pride and prejudice"
"20500",1342,"      Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, “Oh dear!—yes—certainly. I am","Pride and prejudice"
"20501",1342,"      sure Lizzy will be very happy—I am sure she can have no","Pride and prejudice"
"20502",1342,"      objection. Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.” And, gathering her","Pride and prejudice"
"20503",1342,"      work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:","Pride and prejudice"
"20504",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20505",1342,"      “Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must","Pride and prejudice"
"20506",1342,"      excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not","Pride and prejudice"
"20507",1342,"      hear. I am going away myself.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20508",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20509",1342,"      “No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20510",1342,"      And upon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed","Pride and prejudice"
"20511",1342,"      looks, about to escape, she added: “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your","Pride and prejudice"
"20512",1342,"      staying and hearing Mr. Collins.”","Pride and prejudice"
"20513",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20514",1342,"      Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment’s","Pride and prejudice"
"20515",1342,"      consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to","Pride and prejudice"
"20516",1342,"      get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down","Pride and prejudice"
"20517",1342,"      again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings","Pride and prejudice"
"20518",1342,"      which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet","Pride and prejudice"
"20519",1342,"      and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins","Pride and prejudice"
"20520",1342,"      began.","Pride and prejudice"
"20521",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"20522",1342,"      “Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far","Pride and prejudice"
"20523",1342,"      from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other","Pride and prejudice"

"21171",1342,"      general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither","Pride and prejudice"
"21172",1342,"      sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his","Pride and prejudice"
"21173",1342,"      attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her","Pride and prejudice"

"21175",1342,"      marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision","Pride and prejudice"
"21176",1342,"      for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however","Pride and prejudice"
"21177",1342,"      uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest","Pride and prejudice"

"21243",1342,"      this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast,","Pride and prejudice"

"21246",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"21247",1342,"      The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with","Pride and prejudice"
"21248",1342,"      her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or","Pride and prejudice"
"21249",1342,"      two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far","Pride and prejudice"
"21250",1342,"      from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her","Pride and prejudice"
"21251",1342,"      astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first","Pride and prejudice"
"21252",1342,"      the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:","Pride and prejudice"
"21253",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"21254",1342,"      “Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte—impossible!”","Pride and prejudice"
"21255",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"21256",1342,"      The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling","Pride and prejudice"

"21258",1342,"      direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected,","Pride and prejudice"
"21259",1342,"      she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied:","Pride and prejudice"

"21261",1342,"      “Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it","Pride and prejudice"
"21262",1342,"      incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s","Pride and prejudice"
"21263",1342,"      good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with","Pride and prejudice"
"21264",1342,"      you?”","Pride and prejudice"
"21265",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"21266",1342,"      But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong","Pride and prejudice"
"21267",1342,"      effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that","Pride and prejudice"
"21268",1342,"      the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her,","Pride and prejudice"
"21269",1342,"      and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.","Pride and prejudice"
"21270",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"21271",1342,"      “I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte. “You must be","Pride and prejudice"
"21272",1342,"      surprised, very much surprised—so lately as Mr. Collins was","Pride and prejudice"
"21273",1342,"      wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it","Pride and prejudice"
"21274",1342,"      over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am","Pride and prejudice"
"21275",1342,"      not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable","Pride and prejudice"

"21277",1342,"      situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness","Pride and prejudice"

"21280",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"21281",1342,"      Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward","Pride and prejudice"
"21282",1342,"      pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not","Pride and prejudice"
"21283",1342,"      stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what","Pride and prejudice"
"21284",1342,"      she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all","Pride and prejudice"
"21285",1342,"      reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness","Pride and prejudice"
"21286",1342,"      of Mr. Collins’s making two offers of marriage within three days","Pride and prejudice"
"21287",1342,"      was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had","Pride and prejudice"
"21288",1342,"      always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was not exactly","Pride and prejudice"
"21289",1342,"      like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that,","Pride and prejudice"
"21290",1342,"      when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better","Pride and prejudice"
"21291",1342,"      feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins","Pride and prejudice"
"21292",1342,"      was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend","Pride and prejudice"
"21293",1342,"      disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the","Pride and prejudice"

"21304",1342,"      mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his","Pride and prejudice"

"21316",1342,"      Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne","Pride and prejudice"
"21317",1342,"      without anger such treatment; but Sir William’s good breeding","Pride and prejudice"

"21332",1342,"      Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal","Pride and prejudice"
"21333",1342,"      while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than","Pride and prejudice"
"21334",1342,"      her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she","Pride and prejudice"
"21335",1342,"      persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she","Pride and prejudice"
"21336",1342,"      was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she","Pride and prejudice"
"21337",1342,"      trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,","Pride and prejudice"
"21338",1342,"      that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were","Pride and prejudice"
"21339",1342,"      plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real","Pride and prejudice"
"21340",1342,"      cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been","Pride and prejudice"
"21341",1342,"      barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she","Pride and prejudice"
"21342",1342,"      principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could","Pride and prejudice"

"21397",1342,"      Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of","Pride and prejudice"

"21399",1342,"      disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very strange","Pride and prejudice"
"21400",1342,"      that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it","Pride and prejudice"
"21401",1342,"      was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated","Pride and prejudice"

"21403",1342,"      and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were","Pride and prejudice"

"21416",1342,"      Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane’s","Pride and prejudice"

"21426",1342,"      desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth,","Pride and prejudice"
"21427",1342,"      therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such","Pride and prejudice"

"21437",1342,"      on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need","Pride and prejudice"
"21438",1342,"      much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of","Pride and prejudice"
"21439",1342,"      love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The","Pride and prejudice"
"21440",1342,"      chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he","Pride and prejudice"
"21441",1342,"      sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology","Pride and prejudice"
"21442",1342,"      for his absence before the family went to bed.","Pride and prejudice"
"21443",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"21444",1342,"      Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention","Pride and prejudice"
"21445",1342,"      of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of","Pride and prejudice"
"21446",1342,"      ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it","Pride and prejudice"
"21447",1342,"      talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her","Pride and prejudice"
"21448",1342,"      successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous","Pride and prejudice"
"21449",1342,"      abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded","Pride and prejudice"
"21450",1342,"      her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she","Pride and prejudice"
"21451",1342,"      spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were","Pride and prejudice"
"21452",1342,"      talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself","Pride and prejudice"
"21453",1342,"      and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were","Pride and prejudice"

"21464",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"

"21725",1342,"      difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within","Pride and prejudice"
"21726",1342,"      view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and","Pride and prejudice"
"21727",1342,"      agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.","Pride and prejudice"
"21728",1342,"      Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant","Pride and prejudice"

"21730",1342,"      Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a","Pride and prejudice"

"21736",1342,"      this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her","Pride and prejudice"

"21738",1342,"      much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she","Pride and prejudice"
"21739",1342,"      last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of","Pride and prejudice"

"21750",1342,"      all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so","Pride and prejudice"
"21751",1342,"      it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in","Pride and prejudice"
"21752",1342,"      my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves","Pride and prejudice"
"21753",1342,"      before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is","Pride and prejudice"
"21754",1342,"      the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you","Pride and prejudice"

"21970",1342,"      The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent","Pride and prejudice"
"21971",1342,"      from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to","Pride and prejudice"
"21972",1342,"      hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her","Pride and prejudice"
"21973",1342,"      friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as","Pride and prejudice"
"21974",1342,"      it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was","Pride and prejudice"
"21975",1342,"      impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling","Pride and prejudice"
"21976",1342,"      that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined","Pride and prejudice"
"21977",1342,"      not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what","Pride and prejudice"
"21978",1342,"      had been, rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters were","Pride and prejudice"
"21979",1342,"      received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be","Pride and prejudice"
"21980",1342,"      curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she","Pride and prejudice"
"21981",1342,"      would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce","Pride and prejudice"
"21982",1342,"      herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt","Pride and prejudice"
"21983",1342,"      that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she","Pride and prejudice"
"21984",1342,"      might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with","Pride and prejudice"
"21985",1342,"      comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The","Pride and prejudice"
"21986",1342,"      house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her","Pride and prejudice"
"21987",1342,"      taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most friendly and","Pride and prejudice"
"21988",1342,"      obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and Rosings","Pride and prejudice"
"21989",1342,"      rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait","Pride and prejudice"
"21990",1342,"      for her own visit there to know the rest.","Pride and prejudice"
"21991",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"21992",1342,"      Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce","Pride and prejudice"
"21993",1342,"      their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth","Pride and prejudice"
"21994",1342,"      hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.","Pride and prejudice"
"21995",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"21996",1342,"      Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as","Pride and prejudice"
"21997",1342,"      impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without","Pride and prejudice"
"21998",1342,"      either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it,","Pride and prejudice"
"21999",1342,"      however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from","Pride and prejudice"
"22000",1342,"      Longbourn had by some accident been lost.","Pride and prejudice"
"22001",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22002",1342,"      “My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of","Pride and prejudice"

"22005",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22006",1342,"      She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss","Pride and prejudice"
"22007",1342,"      Bingley. “I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words,","Pride and prejudice"
"22008",1342,"      “but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving","Pride and prejudice"
"22009",1342,"      her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my","Pride and prejudice"
"22010",1342,"      last letter had never reached her. I enquired after their","Pride and prejudice"
"22011",1342,"      brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"22012",1342,"      Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy","Pride and prejudice"
"22013",1342,"      was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not","Pride and prejudice"
"22014",1342,"      long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I","Pride and prejudice"
"22015",1342,"      shall see them soon here.”","Pride and prejudice"
"22016",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22017",1342,"      Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that","Pride and prejudice"
"22018",1342,"      accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in","Pride and prejudice"
"22019",1342,"      town.","Pride and prejudice"
"22020",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22021",1342,"      Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She","Pride and prejudice"
"22022",1342,"      endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but","Pride and prejudice"
"22023",1342,"      she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After","Pride and prejudice"
"22024",1342,"      waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing","Pride and prejudice"
"22025",1342,"      every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last","Pride and prejudice"
"22026",1342,"      appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the","Pride and prejudice"
"22027",1342,"      alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no","Pride and prejudice"
"22028",1342,"      longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister","Pride and prejudice"
"22029",1342,"      will prove what she felt.","Pride and prejudice"
"22030",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22031",1342,"      “My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in","Pride and prejudice"
"22032",1342,"      her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to","Pride and prejudice"
"22033",1342,"      have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But,","Pride and prejudice"
"22034",1342,"      my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not","Pride and prejudice"
"22035",1342,"      think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her","Pride and prejudice"
"22036",1342,"      behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I","Pride and prejudice"
"22037",1342,"      do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate","Pride and prejudice"
"22038",1342,"      with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am","Pride and prejudice"
"22039",1342,"      sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit","Pride and prejudice"
"22040",1342,"      till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the","Pride and prejudice"
"22041",1342,"      meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no","Pride and prejudice"
"22042",1342,"      pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not","Pride and prejudice"
"22043",1342,"      calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and","Pride and prejudice"
"22044",1342,"      was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went","Pride and prejudice"
"22045",1342,"      away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no","Pride and prejudice"
"22046",1342,"      longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very","Pride and prejudice"
"22047",1342,"      wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every","Pride and prejudice"
"22048",1342,"      advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because","Pride and prejudice"
"22049",1342,"      she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am","Pride and prejudice"
"22050",1342,"      very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need","Pride and prejudice"
"22051",1342,"      not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know this anxiety to","Pride and prejudice"
"22052",1342,"      be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account","Pride and prejudice"
"22053",1342,"      for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his","Pride and prejudice"
"22054",1342,"      sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural","Pride and prejudice"
"22055",1342,"      and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such","Pride and prejudice"
"22056",1342,"      fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have","Pride and prejudice"
"22057",1342,"      met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from","Pride and prejudice"
"22058",1342,"      something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner","Pride and prejudice"
"22059",1342,"      of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is","Pride and prejudice"
"22060",1342,"      really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were","Pride and prejudice"
"22061",1342,"      not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say","Pride and prejudice"
"22062",1342,"      that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I","Pride and prejudice"
"22063",1342,"      will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of","Pride and prejudice"
"22064",1342,"      what will make me happy—your affection, and the invariable","Pride and prejudice"
"22065",1342,"      kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very","Pride and prejudice"
"22066",1342,"      soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to","Pride and prejudice"
"22067",1342,"      Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any","Pride and prejudice"
"22068",1342,"      certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that","Pride and prejudice"
"22069",1342,"      you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.","Pride and prejudice"
"22070",1342,"      Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you","Pride and prejudice"
"22071",1342,"      will be very comfortable there.—Yours, etc.”","Pride and prejudice"
"22072",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22073",1342,"      This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as","Pride and prejudice"
"22074",1342,"      she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister","Pride and prejudice"
"22075",1342,"      at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely","Pride and prejudice"
"22076",1342,"      over. She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.","Pride and prejudice"
"22077",1342,"      His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for","Pride and prejudice"
"22078",1342,"      him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped","Pride and prejudice"
"22079",1342,"      he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy’s sister, as by Wickham’s","Pride and prejudice"
"22080",1342,"      account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown","Pride and prejudice"
"22081",1342,"      away.","Pride and prejudice"
"22082",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22083",1342,"      Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise","Pride and prejudice"
"22084",1342,"      concerning that gentleman, and required information; and","Pride and prejudice"
"22085",1342,"      Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to","Pride and prejudice"
"22086",1342,"      her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided,","Pride and prejudice"
"22087",1342,"      his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.","Pride and prejudice"
"22088",1342,"      Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it","Pride and prejudice"
"22089",1342,"      and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but","Pride and prejudice"
"22090",1342,"      slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing","Pride and prejudice"
"22091",1342,"      that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted","Pride and prejudice"
"22092",1342,"      it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most","Pride and prejudice"
"22093",1342,"      remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering","Pride and prejudice"
"22094",1342,"      himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in","Pride and prejudice"
"22095",1342,"      this case than in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his","Pride and prejudice"
"22096",1342,"      wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more","Pride and prejudice"
"22097",1342,"      natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few","Pride and prejudice"
"22098",1342,"      struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and","Pride and prejudice"
"22099",1342,"      desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him","Pride and prejudice"
"22100",1342,"      happy.","Pride and prejudice"
"22101",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22102",1342,"      All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating","Pride and prejudice"
"22103",1342,"      the circumstances, she thus went on: “I am now convinced, my dear","Pride and prejudice"
"22104",1342,"      aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really","Pride and prejudice"
"22105",1342,"      experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present","Pride and prejudice"
"22106",1342,"      detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my","Pride and prejudice"
"22107",1342,"      feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even","Pride and prejudice"
"22108",1342,"      impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at","Pride and prejudice"
"22109",1342,"      all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good","Pride and prejudice"
"22110",1342,"      sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness","Pride and prejudice"
"22111",1342,"      has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more","Pride and prejudice"
"22112",1342,"      interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in","Pride and prejudice"
"22113",1342,"      love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative","Pride and prejudice"
"22114",1342,"      insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.","Pride and prejudice"
"22115",1342,"      Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.","Pride and prejudice"
"22116",1342,"      They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the","Pride and prejudice"

"22127",1342,"      sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass","Pride and prejudice"
"22128",1342,"      away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at","Pride and prejudice"
"22129",1342,"      first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she","Pride and prejudice"
"22130",1342,"      soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned","Pride and prejudice"
"22131",1342,"      to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater","Pride and prejudice"
"22132",1342,"      certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte","Pride and prejudice"
"22133",1342,"      again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty","Pride and prejudice"
"22134",1342,"      in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such","Pride and prejudice"
"22135",1342,"      uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little","Pride and prejudice"
"22136",1342,"      change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would","Pride and prejudice"
"22137",1342,"      moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew","Pride and prejudice"
"22138",1342,"      near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything,","Pride and prejudice"
"22139",1342,"      however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to","Pride and prejudice"
"22140",1342,"      Charlotte’s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and","Pride and prejudice"
"22141",1342,"      his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in","Pride and prejudice"

"22144",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22145",1342,"      The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss","Pride and prejudice"

"22169",1342,"      could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and","Pride and prejudice"
"22170",1342,"      knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his","Pride and prejudice"

"22172",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22173",1342,"      It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so","Pride and prejudice"
"22174",1342,"      early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to","Pride and prejudice"
"22175",1342,"      Mr. Gardiner’s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching","Pride and prejudice"
"22176",1342,"      their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to","Pride and prejudice"
"22177",1342,"      welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was","Pride and prejudice"
"22178",1342,"      pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs","Pride and prejudice"
"22179",1342,"      were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their","Pride and prejudice"
"22180",1342,"      cousin’s appearance would not allow them to wait in the","Pride and prejudice"

"22182",1342,"      twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and","Pride and prejudice"
"22183",1342,"      kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in","Pride and prejudice"

"22185",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22186",1342,"      Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object","Pride and prejudice"
"22187",1342,"      was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear,","Pride and prejudice"
"22188",1342,"      in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always","Pride and prejudice"
"22189",1342,"      struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of","Pride and prejudice"
"22190",1342,"      dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would","Pride and prejudice"
"22191",1342,"      not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of","Pride and prejudice"

"22377",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22378",1342,"      The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,","Pride and prejudice"

"22509",1342,"      where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were","Pride and prejudice"
"22510",1342,"      sitting. Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive","Pride and prejudice"

"22518",1342,"      just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat","Pride and prejudice"
"22519",1342,"      without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of","Pride and prejudice"
"22520",1342,"      her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way","Pride and prejudice"
"22521",1342,"      to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and","Pride and prejudice"
"22522",1342,"      could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady","Pride and prejudice"
"22523",1342,"      Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features,","Pride and prejudice"
"22524",1342,"      which might once have been handsome. Her air was not","Pride and prejudice"
"22525",1342,"      conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to","Pride and prejudice"
"22526",1342,"      make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not","Pride and prejudice"
"22527",1342,"      rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken","Pride and prejudice"
"22528",1342,"      in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and","Pride and prejudice"
"22529",1342,"      brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth’s mind; and from the","Pride and prejudice"

"22536",1342,"      Maria’s astonishment at her being so thin and so small. There was","Pride and prejudice"
"22537",1342,"      neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss","Pride and prejudice"
"22538",1342,"      de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain,","Pride and prejudice"
"22539",1342,"      were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low","Pride and prejudice"
"22540",1342,"      voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing","Pride and prejudice"
"22541",1342,"      remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she","Pride and prejudice"

"22549",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22550",1342,"      The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the","Pride and prejudice"
"22551",1342,"      servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had","Pride and prejudice"
"22552",1342,"      promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at","Pride and prejudice"
"22553",1342,"      the bottom of the table, by her ladyship’s desire, and looked as","Pride and prejudice"
"22554",1342,"      if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved,","Pride and prejudice"
"22555",1342,"      and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was","Pride and prejudice"
"22556",1342,"      commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now","Pride and prejudice"
"22557",1342,"      enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a","Pride and prejudice"
"22558",1342,"      manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But","Pride and prejudice"
"22559",1342,"      Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration,","Pride and prejudice"
"22560",1342,"      and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the","Pride and prejudice"
"22561",1342,"      table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much","Pride and prejudice"
"22562",1342,"      conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an","Pride and prejudice"
"22563",1342,"      opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de","Pride and prejudice"
"22564",1342,"      Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady","Pride and prejudice"
"22565",1342,"      Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time.","Pride and prejudice"
"22566",1342,"      Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss","Pride and prejudice"
"22567",1342,"      de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing","Pride and prejudice"
"22568",1342,"      she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,","Pride and prejudice"
"22569",1342,"      and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.","Pride and prejudice"
"22570",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22571",1342,"      When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to","Pride and prejudice"
"22572",1342,"      be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without","Pride and prejudice"
"22573",1342,"      any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on","Pride and prejudice"
"22574",1342,"      every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not","Pride and prejudice"
"22575",1342,"      used to have her judgement controverted. She enquired into","Pride and prejudice"
"22576",1342,"      Charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a","Pride and prejudice"
"22577",1342,"      great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her","Pride and prejudice"
"22578",1342,"      how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as","Pride and prejudice"
"22579",1342,"      hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her","Pride and prejudice"
"22580",1342,"      poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great","Pride and prejudice"
"22581",1342,"      lady’s attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of","Pride and prejudice"
"22582",1342,"      dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.","Pride and prejudice"
"22583",1342,"      Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and","Pride and prejudice"
"22584",1342,"      Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she","Pride and prejudice"
"22585",1342,"      knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very","Pride and prejudice"
"22586",1342,"      genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times,","Pride and prejudice"
"22587",1342,"      how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than","Pride and prejudice"
"22588",1342,"      herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether","Pride and prejudice"
"22589",1342,"      they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage","Pride and prejudice"
"22590",1342,"      her father kept, and what had been her mother’s maiden name?","Pride and prejudice"
"22591",1342,"      Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered","Pride and prejudice"
"22592",1342,"      them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,","Pride and prejudice"

"22596",1342,"      I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It","Pride and prejudice"
"22597",1342,"      was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you","Pride and prejudice"

"22691",1342,"      Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose","Pride and prejudice"
"22692",1342,"      to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting","Pride and prejudice"
"22693",1342,"      Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was","Pride and prejudice"
"22694",1342,"      superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did","Pride and prejudice"
"22695",1342,"      not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her","Pride and prejudice"
"22696",1342,"      fears of Miss de Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or having","Pride and prejudice"
"22697",1342,"      too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the","Pride and prejudice"
"22698",1342,"      other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking—stating the","Pride and prejudice"
"22699",1342,"      mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of","Pride and prejudice"
"22700",1342,"      herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her","Pride and prejudice"
"22701",1342,"      ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and","Pride and prejudice"
"22702",1342,"      apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not","Pride and prejudice"
"22703",1342,"      say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble","Pride and prejudice"

"22706",1342,"      When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they","Pride and prejudice"
"22707",1342,"      chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to","Pride and prejudice"
"22708",1342,"      Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The","Pride and prejudice"
"22709",1342,"      party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine","Pride and prejudice"
"22710",1342,"      determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From","Pride and prejudice"
"22711",1342,"      these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the","Pride and prejudice"

"22714",1342,"      they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her","Pride and prejudice"
"22715",1342,"      cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings,","Pride and prejudice"
"22716",1342,"      which, for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it","Pride and prejudice"
"22717",1342,"      really was. But her commendation, though costing her some","Pride and prejudice"
"22718",1342,"      trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very","Pride and prejudice"
"22719",1342,"      soon obliged to take her ladyship’s praise into his own hands.","Pride and prejudice"

"22726",1342,"      Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was","Pride and prejudice"
"22727",1342,"      long enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most","Pride and prejudice"
"22728",1342,"      comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and","Pride and prejudice"
"22729",1342,"      such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William","Pride and prejudice"
"22730",1342,"      was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out","Pride and prejudice"
"22731",1342,"      in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away,","Pride and prejudice"
"22732",1342,"      the whole family returned to their usual employments, and","Pride and prejudice"
"22733",1342,"      Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her","Pride and prejudice"

"22737",1342,"      in his own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in which","Pride and prejudice"
"22738",1342,"      the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather","Pride and prejudice"
"22739",1342,"      wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for","Pride and prejudice"
"22740",1342,"      common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant","Pride and prejudice"
"22741",1342,"      aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason","Pride and prejudice"
"22742",1342,"      for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been","Pride and prejudice"
"22743",1342,"      much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally","Pride and prejudice"
"22744",1342,"      lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.","Pride and prejudice"
"22745",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22746",1342,"      From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane,","Pride and prejudice"
"22747",1342,"      and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what","Pride and prejudice"
"22748",1342,"      carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh","Pride and prejudice"

"22750",1342,"      them of, though it happened almost every day. She not","Pride and prejudice"
"22751",1342,"      unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes’","Pride and prejudice"
"22752",1342,"      conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon","Pride and prejudice"
"22753",1342,"      to get out.","Pride and prejudice"
"22754",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22755",1342,"      Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to","Pride and prejudice"
"22756",1342,"      Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it","Pride and prejudice"
"22757",1342,"      necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that","Pride and prejudice"
"22758",1342,"      there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could","Pride and prejudice"
"22759",1342,"      not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they","Pride and prejudice"
"22760",1342,"      were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped","Pride and prejudice"
"22761",1342,"      her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.","Pride and prejudice"
"22762",1342,"      She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and","Pride and prejudice"
"22763",1342,"      advised them to do it differently; found fault with the","Pride and prejudice"
"22764",1342,"      arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in","Pride and prejudice"
"22765",1342,"      negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it","Pride and prejudice"
"22766",1342,"      only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of","Pride and prejudice"
"22767",1342,"      meat were too large for her family.","Pride and prejudice"
"22768",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22769",1342,"      Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in","Pride and prejudice"
"22770",1342,"      the commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active","Pride and prejudice"
"22771",1342,"      magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were","Pride and prejudice"
"22772",1342,"      carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers","Pride and prejudice"

"22776",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22777",1342,"      The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a","Pride and prejudice"
"22778",1342,"      week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being","Pride and prejudice"
"22779",1342,"      only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was","Pride and prejudice"
"22780",1342,"      the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few,","Pride and prejudice"
"22781",1342,"      as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond","Pride and prejudice"
"22782",1342,"      Mr. Collins’s reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and","Pride and prejudice"
"22783",1342,"      upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were","Pride and prejudice"
"22784",1342,"      half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the","Pride and prejudice"
"22785",1342,"      weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great","Pride and prejudice"
"22786",1342,"      enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she","Pride and prejudice"
"22787",1342,"      frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine,","Pride and prejudice"
"22788",1342,"      was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where","Pride and prejudice"
"22789",1342,"      there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but","Pride and prejudice"
"22790",1342,"      herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s","Pride and prejudice"
"22791",1342,"      curiosity.","Pride and prejudice"
"22792",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22793",1342,"      In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed","Pride and prejudice"
"22794",1342,"      away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to","Pride and prejudice"
"22795",1342,"      bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a","Pride and prejudice"
"22796",1342,"      circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her","Pride and prejudice"
"22797",1342,"      arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few","Pride and prejudice"
"22798",1342,"      weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom","Pride and prejudice"
"22799",1342,"      she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively","Pride and prejudice"
"22800",1342,"      new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused","Pride and prejudice"
"22801",1342,"      in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him were, by his","Pride and prejudice"
"22802",1342,"      behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by","Pride and prejudice"
"22803",1342,"      Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest","Pride and prejudice"
"22804",1342,"      satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration,","Pride and prejudice"
"22805",1342,"      and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been","Pride and prejudice"
"22806",1342,"      frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.","Pride and prejudice"
"22807",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22808",1342,"      His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was","Pride and prejudice"
"22809",1342,"      walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into","Pride and prejudice"
"22810",1342,"      Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and","Pride and prejudice"
"22811",1342,"      after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park,","Pride and prejudice"
"22812",1342,"      hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following","Pride and prejudice"
"22813",1342,"      morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were","Pride and prejudice"
"22814",1342,"      two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had","Pride and prejudice"
"22815",1342,"      brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his","Pride and prejudice"
"22816",1342,"      uncle Lord ——, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when","Pride and prejudice"
"22817",1342,"      Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte","Pride and prejudice"
"22818",1342,"      had seen them from her husband’s room, crossing the road, and","Pride and prejudice"
"22819",1342,"      immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour","Pride and prejudice"
"22820",1342,"      they might expect, adding:","Pride and prejudice"
"22821",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22822",1342,"      “I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy","Pride and prejudice"
"22823",1342,"      would never have come so soon to wait upon me.”","Pride and prejudice"
"22824",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22825",1342,"      Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the","Pride and prejudice"
"22826",1342,"      compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell,","Pride and prejudice"
"22827",1342,"      and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.","Pride and prejudice"
"22828",1342,"      Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not","Pride and prejudice"
"22829",1342,"      handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"22830",1342,"      Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in","Pride and prejudice"
"22831",1342,"      Hertfordshire—paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to","Pride and prejudice"
"22832",1342,"      Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her","Pride and prejudice"
"22833",1342,"      friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth","Pride and prejudice"
"22834",1342,"      merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.","Pride and prejudice"
"22835",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22836",1342,"      Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the","Pride and prejudice"
"22837",1342,"      readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very","Pride and prejudice"
"22838",1342,"      pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight","Pride and prejudice"
"22839",1342,"      observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some","Pride and prejudice"
"22840",1342,"      time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his","Pride and prejudice"
"22841",1342,"      civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the","Pride and prejudice"
"22842",1342,"      health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and","Pride and prejudice"
"22843",1342,"      after a moment’s pause, added:","Pride and prejudice"
"22844",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22845",1342,"      “My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you","Pride and prejudice"
"22846",1342,"      never happened to see her there?”","Pride and prejudice"
"22847",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22848",1342,"      She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to","Pride and prejudice"
"22849",1342,"      see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed","Pride and prejudice"
"22850",1342,"      between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little","Pride and prejudice"
"22851",1342,"      confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to","Pride and prejudice"
"22852",1342,"      meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the","Pride and prejudice"

"22862",1342,"      to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some","Pride and prejudice"
"22863",1342,"      days, however, before they received any invitation thither—for","Pride and prejudice"
"22864",1342,"      while there were visitors in the house, they could not be","Pride and prejudice"
"22865",1342,"      necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after","Pride and prejudice"
"22866",1342,"      the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by such an","Pride and prejudice"
"22867",1342,"      attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to","Pride and prejudice"
"22868",1342,"      come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very","Pride and prejudice"
"22869",1342,"      little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had","Pride and prejudice"
"22870",1342,"      called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"22871",1342,"      Darcy they had seen only at church.","Pride and prejudice"
"22872",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22873",1342,"      The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they","Pride and prejudice"
"22874",1342,"      joined the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her ladyship","Pride and prejudice"
"22875",1342,"      received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by","Pride and prejudice"
"22876",1342,"      no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she","Pride and prejudice"
"22877",1342,"      was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them,","Pride and prejudice"
"22878",1342,"      especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the","Pride and prejudice"
"22879",1342,"      room.","Pride and prejudice"
"22880",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22881",1342,"      Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was","Pride and prejudice"
"22882",1342,"      a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty","Pride and prejudice"
"22883",1342,"      friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated","Pride and prejudice"
"22884",1342,"      himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and","Pride and prejudice"
"22885",1342,"      Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books","Pride and prejudice"
"22886",1342,"      and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained","Pride and prejudice"
"22887",1342,"      in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and","Pride and prejudice"
"22888",1342,"      flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well","Pride and prejudice"
"22889",1342,"      as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned","Pride and prejudice"
"22890",1342,"      towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship,","Pride and prejudice"
"22891",1342,"      after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged,","Pride and prejudice"
"22892",1342,"      for she did not scruple to call out:","Pride and prejudice"
"22893",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22894",1342,"      “What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are","Pride and prejudice"

"22904",1342,"      who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better","Pride and prejudice"
"22905",1342,"      natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great","Pride and prejudice"

"22934",1342,"      having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the","Pride and prejudice"
"22935",1342,"      instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to","Pride and prejudice"
"22936",1342,"      half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew;","Pride and prejudice"
"22937",1342,"      till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual","Pride and prejudice"

"22944",1342,"      to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play","Pride and prejudice"
"22945",1342,"      so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to","Pride and prejudice"
"22946",1342,"      be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at","Pride and prejudice"

"22948",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22949",1342,"      “I shall not say you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you","Pride and prejudice"
"22950",1342,"      could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming","Pride and prejudice"
"22951",1342,"      you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough","Pride and prejudice"
"22952",1342,"      to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing","Pride and prejudice"
"22953",1342,"      opinions which in fact are not your own.”","Pride and prejudice"
"22954",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22955",1342,"      Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said","Pride and prejudice"
"22956",1342,"      to Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty","Pride and prejudice"
"22957",1342,"      notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am","Pride and prejudice"
"22958",1342,"      particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose","Pride and prejudice"
"22959",1342,"      my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to","Pride and prejudice"
"22960",1342,"      pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it","Pride and prejudice"
"22961",1342,"      is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my","Pride and prejudice"
"22962",1342,"      disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and, give me leave to say, very","Pride and prejudice"
"22963",1342,"      impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such","Pride and prejudice"

"22965",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22966",1342,"      “I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.","Pride and prejudice"

"22972",1342,"      “You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very","Pride and prejudice"

"22974",1342,"      you must know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do you think","Pride and prejudice"
"22975",1342,"      he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce;","Pride and prejudice"
"22976",1342,"      and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was","Pride and prejudice"

"22986",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22987",1342,"      “Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better, had I sought","Pride and prejudice"
"22988",1342,"      an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to","Pride and prejudice"

"22990",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"22991",1342,"      “Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth,","Pride and prejudice"
"22992",1342,"      still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man","Pride and prejudice"
"22993",1342,"      of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill","Pride and prejudice"

"23003",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23004",1342,"      “My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument","Pride and prejudice"
"23005",1342,"      in the masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have","Pride and prejudice"
"23006",1342,"      not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same","Pride and prejudice"
"23007",1342,"      expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own","Pride and prejudice"
"23008",1342,"      fault—because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is","Pride and prejudice"
"23009",1342,"      not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other","Pride and prejudice"

"23011",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23012",1342,"      Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have","Pride and prejudice"
"23013",1342,"      employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege","Pride and prejudice"
"23014",1342,"      of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us","Pride and prejudice"

"23016",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23017",1342,"      Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to","Pride and prejudice"
"23018",1342,"      know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began","Pride and prejudice"
"23019",1342,"      playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening","Pride and prejudice"
"23020",1342,"      for a few minutes, said to Darcy:","Pride and prejudice"
"23021",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23022",1342,"      “Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more,","Pride and prejudice"
"23023",1342,"      and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very","Pride and prejudice"
"23024",1342,"      good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to","Pride and prejudice"
"23025",1342,"      Anne’s. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her","Pride and prejudice"

"23030",1342,"      could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his","Pride and prejudice"
"23031",1342,"      behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss","Pride and prejudice"
"23032",1342,"      Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_,","Pride and prejudice"

"23034",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23035",1342,"      Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance,","Pride and prejudice"
"23036",1342,"      mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.","Pride and prejudice"
"23037",1342,"      Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility,","Pride and prejudice"
"23038",1342,"      and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument","Pride and prejudice"

"23047",1342,"      Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the","Pride and prejudice"
"23048",1342,"      village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain","Pride and prejudice"
"23049",1342,"      signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it","Pride and prejudice"
"23050",1342,"      not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension","Pride and prejudice"
"23051",1342,"      was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape","Pride and prejudice"

"23054",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23055",1342,"      He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for","Pride and prejudice"

"23058",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23059",1342,"      They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were","Pride and prejudice"
"23060",1342,"      made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was","Pride and prejudice"
"23061",1342,"      absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in","Pride and prejudice"
"23062",1342,"      this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in","Pride and prejudice"
"23063",1342,"      Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on","Pride and prejudice"
"23064",1342,"      the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:","Pride and prejudice"

"23066",1342,"      “How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr.","Pride and prejudice"

"23068",1342,"      to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he","Pride and prejudice"
"23069",1342,"      went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope,","Pride and prejudice"

"23081",1342,"      spend very little of his time there in the future. He has many","Pride and prejudice"
"23082",1342,"      friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements","Pride and prejudice"

"23095",1342,"      Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his","Pride and prejudice"

"23099",1342,"      He took the hint, and soon began with, “This seems a very","Pride and prejudice"

"23112",1342,"      understanding—though I am not certain that I consider her","Pride and prejudice"

"23117",1342,"      “It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a","Pride and prejudice"

"23119",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"

"23132",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23133",1342,"      As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she","Pride and prejudice"
"23134",1342,"      understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and","Pride and prejudice"
"23135",1342,"      Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:","Pride and prejudice"

"23137",1342,"      “I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near","Pride and prejudice"

"23139",1342,"      many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the","Pride and prejudice"
"23140",1342,"      expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But","Pride and prejudice"
"23141",1342,"      that is not the case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a","Pride and prejudice"
"23142",1342,"      comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent","Pride and prejudice"
"23143",1342,"      journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself","Pride and prejudice"
"23144",1342,"      _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance.”","Pride and prejudice"
"23145",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23146",1342,"      Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_","Pride and prejudice"
"23147",1342,"      cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_","Pride and prejudice"

"23149",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23150",1342,"      Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change","Pride and prejudice"
"23151",1342,"      of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the","Pride and prejudice"
"23152",1342,"      table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:","Pride and prejudice"
"23153",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23154",1342,"      “Are you pleased with Kent?”","Pride and prejudice"
"23155",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23156",1342,"      A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either","Pride and prejudice"
"23157",1342,"      side calm and concise—and soon put an end to by the entrance of","Pride and prejudice"
"23158",1342,"      Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The","Pride and prejudice"
"23159",1342,"      _tête-à-tête_ surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which","Pride and prejudice"
"23160",1342,"      had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a","Pride and prejudice"
"23161",1342,"      few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.","Pride and prejudice"
"23162",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23163",1342,"      “What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he","Pride and prejudice"
"23164",1342,"      was gone. “My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he","Pride and prejudice"

"23168",1342,"      likely, even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and after","Pride and prejudice"
"23169",1342,"      various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to","Pride and prejudice"
"23170",1342,"      proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was","Pride and prejudice"
"23171",1342,"      the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were","Pride and prejudice"
"23172",1342,"      over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a","Pride and prejudice"
"23173",1342,"      billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and","Pride and prejudice"
"23174",1342,"      in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk","Pride and prejudice"
"23175",1342,"      to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a","Pride and prejudice"
"23176",1342,"      temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.","Pride and prejudice"
"23177",1342,"      They called at various times of the morning, sometimes","Pride and prejudice"
"23178",1342,"      separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by","Pride and prejudice"
"23179",1342,"      their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam","Pride and prejudice"
"23180",1342,"      came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which","Pride and prejudice"
"23181",1342,"      of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded","Pride and prejudice"
"23182",1342,"      by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his","Pride and prejudice"
"23183",1342,"      evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George","Pride and prejudice"
"23184",1342,"      Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less","Pride and prejudice"
"23185",1342,"      captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she","Pride and prejudice"
"23186",1342,"      believed he might have the best informed mind.","Pride and prejudice"
"23187",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23188",1342,"      But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more","Pride and prejudice"
"23189",1342,"      difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he","Pride and prejudice"
"23190",1342,"      frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his","Pride and prejudice"
"23191",1342,"      lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity","Pride and prejudice"
"23192",1342,"      rather than of choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to","Pride and prejudice"
"23193",1342,"      himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew","Pride and prejudice"
"23194",1342,"      not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam’s occasionally","Pride and prejudice"
"23195",1342,"      laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally","Pride and prejudice"
"23196",1342,"      different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told","Pride and prejudice"
"23197",1342,"      her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the","Pride and prejudice"
"23198",1342,"      effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she","Pride and prejudice"
"23199",1342,"      set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him","Pride and prejudice"
"23200",1342,"      whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford;","Pride and prejudice"
"23201",1342,"      but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a","Pride and prejudice"
"23202",1342,"      great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It","Pride and prejudice"
"23203",1342,"      was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether","Pride and prejudice"
"23204",1342,"      there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing","Pride and prejudice"
"23205",1342,"      but absence of mind.","Pride and prejudice"
"23206",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23207",1342,"      She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of","Pride and prejudice"
"23208",1342,"      his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the","Pride and prejudice"
"23209",1342,"      idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the","Pride and prejudice"
"23210",1342,"      subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only","Pride and prejudice"
"23211",1342,"      end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a","Pride and prejudice"
"23212",1342,"      doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would vanish, if she could","Pride and prejudice"
"23213",1342,"      suppose him to be in her power.","Pride and prejudice"
"23214",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23215",1342,"      In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her","Pride and prejudice"
"23216",1342,"      marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most","Pride and prejudice"
"23217",1342,"      pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life","Pride and prejudice"
"23218",1342,"      was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr.","Pride and prejudice"

"23230",1342,"      and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him","Pride and prejudice"
"23231",1342,"      at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could","Pride and prejudice"
"23232",1342,"      occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and","Pride and prejudice"
"23233",1342,"      even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary","Pride and prejudice"

"23236",1342,"      thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never","Pride and prejudice"
"23237",1342,"      said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of","Pride and prejudice"
"23238",1342,"      talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of","Pride and prejudice"
"23239",1342,"      their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected","Pride and prejudice"
"23240",1342,"      questions—about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of","Pride and prejudice"
"23241",1342,"      solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s","Pride and prejudice"
"23242",1342,"      happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly","Pride and prejudice"
"23243",1342,"      understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she","Pride and prejudice"
"23244",1342,"      came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words","Pride and prejudice"
"23245",1342,"      seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his","Pride and prejudice"
"23246",1342,"      thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an","Pride and prejudice"
"23247",1342,"      allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a","Pride and prejudice"

"23287",1342,"      and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money","Pride and prejudice"
"23288",1342,"      from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a","Pride and prejudice"

"23316",1342,"      perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is","Pride and prejudice"

"23459",1342,"      complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any","Pride and prejudice"
"23460",1342,"      communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost","Pride and prejudice"

"23466",1342,"      uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the","Pride and prejudice"
"23467",1342,"      first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s shameful boast of what misery he had","Pride and prejudice"
"23468",1342,"      been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister’s","Pride and prejudice"

"23483",1342,"      before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire","Pride and prejudice"
"23484",1342,"      particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her","Pride and prejudice"
"23485",1342,"      spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter","Pride and prejudice"
"23486",1342,"      amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried","Pride and prejudice"
"23487",1342,"      manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing","Pride and prejudice"
"23488",1342,"      his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered","Pride and prejudice"
"23489",1342,"      him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then","Pride and prejudice"
"23490",1342,"      getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but","Pride and prejudice"
"23491",1342,"      said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came","Pride and prejudice"
"23492",1342,"      towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:","Pride and prejudice"
"23493",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23494",1342,"      “In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not","Pride and prejudice"

"23496",1342,"      and love you.”","Pride and prejudice"
"23497",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23498",1342,"      Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared,","Pride and prejudice"
"23499",1342,"      coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient","Pride and prejudice"
"23500",1342,"      encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long","Pride and prejudice"
"23501",1342,"      felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were","Pride and prejudice"
"23502",1342,"      feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was","Pride and prejudice"
"23503",1342,"      not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His","Pride and prejudice"
"23504",1342,"      sense of her inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family","Pride and prejudice"
"23505",1342,"      obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on","Pride and prejudice"
"23506",1342,"      with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was","Pride and prejudice"
"23507",1342,"      wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.","Pride and prejudice"
"23508",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23509",1342,"      In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be","Pride and prejudice"
"23510",1342,"      insensible to the compliment of such a man’s affection, and","Pride and prejudice"
"23511",1342,"      though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at","Pride and prejudice"
"23512",1342,"      first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to","Pride and prejudice"
"23513",1342,"      resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in","Pride and prejudice"
"23514",1342,"      anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with","Pride and prejudice"
"23515",1342,"      patience, when he should have done. He concluded with","Pride and prejudice"
"23516",1342,"      representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in","Pride and prejudice"
"23517",1342,"      spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer;","Pride and prejudice"
"23518",1342,"      and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her","Pride and prejudice"
"23519",1342,"      acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see","Pride and prejudice"
"23520",1342,"      that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of","Pride and prejudice"
"23521",1342,"      apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real","Pride and prejudice"
"23522",1342,"      security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and,","Pride and prejudice"
"23523",1342,"      when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said:","Pride and prejudice"
"23524",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23525",1342,"      “In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to","Pride and prejudice"
"23526",1342,"      express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however","Pride and prejudice"
"23527",1342,"      unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation","Pride and prejudice"
"23528",1342,"      should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now","Pride and prejudice"
"23529",1342,"      thank you. But I cannot—I have never desired your good opinion,","Pride and prejudice"
"23530",1342,"      and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry","Pride and prejudice"
"23531",1342,"      to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously","Pride and prejudice"
"23532",1342,"      done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings","Pride and prejudice"
"23533",1342,"      which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of","Pride and prejudice"
"23534",1342,"      your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after","Pride and prejudice"
"23535",1342,"      this explanation.”","Pride and prejudice"
"23536",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23537",1342,"      Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes","Pride and prejudice"
"23538",1342,"      fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less","Pride and prejudice"
"23539",1342,"      resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger,","Pride and prejudice"
"23540",1342,"      and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He","Pride and prejudice"
"23541",1342,"      was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not","Pride and prejudice"
"23542",1342,"      open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The","Pride and prejudice"
"23543",1342,"      pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings dreadful. At length, with a","Pride and prejudice"
"23544",1342,"      voice of forced calmness, he said:","Pride and prejudice"
"23545",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23546",1342,"      “And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of","Pride and prejudice"
"23547",1342,"      expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so","Pride and prejudice"
"23548",1342,"      little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of","Pride and prejudice"
"23549",1342,"      small importance.”","Pride and prejudice"
"23550",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23551",1342,"      “I might as well enquire,” replied she, “why with so evident a","Pride and prejudice"
"23552",1342,"      desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that","Pride and prejudice"
"23553",1342,"      you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even","Pride and prejudice"
"23554",1342,"      against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility,","Pride and prejudice"
"23555",1342,"      if I _was_ uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I","Pride and prejudice"
"23556",1342,"      have. Had not my feelings decided against you—had they been","Pride and prejudice"
"23557",1342,"      indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that","Pride and prejudice"
"23558",1342,"      any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been","Pride and prejudice"
"23559",1342,"      the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most","Pride and prejudice"
"23560",1342,"      beloved sister?”","Pride and prejudice"
"23561",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23562",1342,"      As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the","Pride and prejudice"
"23563",1342,"      emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to","Pride and prejudice"
"23564",1342,"      interrupt her while she continued:","Pride and prejudice"
"23565",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23566",1342,"      “I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive","Pride and prejudice"
"23567",1342,"      can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You","Pride and prejudice"
"23568",1342,"      dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if","Pride and prejudice"

"23571",1342,"      the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving","Pride and prejudice"

"23573",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23574",1342,"      She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was","Pride and prejudice"
"23575",1342,"      listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any","Pride and prejudice"
"23576",1342,"      feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of","Pride and prejudice"
"23577",1342,"      affected incredulity.","Pride and prejudice"
"23578",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23579",1342,"      “Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.","Pride and prejudice"
"23580",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23581",1342,"      With assumed tranquillity he then replied: “I have no wish of","Pride and prejudice"

"23583",1342,"      from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_","Pride and prejudice"

"23585",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23586",1342,"      Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil","Pride and prejudice"

"23589",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23590",1342,"      “But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my","Pride and prejudice"
"23591",1342,"      dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of","Pride and prejudice"
"23592",1342,"      you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which","Pride and prejudice"
"23593",1342,"      I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject,","Pride and prejudice"
"23594",1342,"      what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can","Pride and prejudice"

"23597",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23598",1342,"      “You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said","Pride and prejudice"
"23599",1342,"      Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.","Pride and prejudice"
"23600",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23601",1342,"      “Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling","Pride and prejudice"

"23603",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23604",1342,"      “His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yes, his","Pride and prejudice"

"23606",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23607",1342,"      “And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “You have","Pride and prejudice"
"23608",1342,"      reduced him to his present state of poverty—comparative poverty.","Pride and prejudice"
"23609",1342,"      You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been","Pride and prejudice"
"23610",1342,"      designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of","Pride and prejudice"
"23611",1342,"      that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You","Pride and prejudice"
"23612",1342,"      have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his","Pride and prejudice"

"23614",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23615",1342,"      “And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the","Pride and prejudice"

"23617",1342,"      hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults,","Pride and prejudice"
"23618",1342,"      according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,”","Pride and prejudice"
"23619",1342,"      added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, “these","Pride and prejudice"
"23620",1342,"      offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt","Pride and prejudice"
"23621",1342,"      by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented","Pride and prejudice"
"23622",1342,"      my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might","Pride and prejudice"
"23623",1342,"      have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my","Pride and prejudice"

"23631",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23632",1342,"      Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she","Pride and prejudice"
"23633",1342,"      tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:","Pride and prejudice"
"23634",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23635",1342,"      “You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of","Pride and prejudice"
"23636",1342,"      your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared","Pride and prejudice"
"23637",1342,"      me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you","Pride and prejudice"

"23639",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23640",1342,"      She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she","Pride and prejudice"
"23641",1342,"      continued:","Pride and prejudice"
"23642",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23643",1342,"      “You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible","Pride and prejudice"

"23645",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23646",1342,"      Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an","Pride and prejudice"
"23647",1342,"      expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:","Pride and prejudice"

"23651",1342,"      the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your","Pride and prejudice"
"23652",1342,"      selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form","Pride and prejudice"
"23653",1342,"      the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have","Pride and prejudice"
"23654",1342,"      built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month","Pride and prejudice"
"23655",1342,"      before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I","Pride and prejudice"
"23656",1342,"      could ever be prevailed on to marry.”","Pride and prejudice"
"23657",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23658",1342,"      “You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your","Pride and prejudice"
"23659",1342,"      feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have","Pride and prejudice"
"23660",1342,"      been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and","Pride and prejudice"

"23664",1342,"      heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.","Pride and prejudice"
"23665",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23666",1342,"      The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how","Pride and prejudice"
"23667",1342,"      to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried","Pride and prejudice"
"23668",1342,"      for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had","Pride and prejudice"
"23669",1342,"      passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should","Pride and prejudice"
"23670",1342,"      receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have","Pride and prejudice"
"23671",1342,"      been in love with her for so many months! So much in love as to","Pride and prejudice"
"23672",1342,"      wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made","Pride and prejudice"
"23673",1342,"      him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which must","Pride and prejudice"
"23674",1342,"      appear at least with equal force in his own case—was almost","Pride and prejudice"
"23675",1342,"      incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so","Pride and prejudice"
"23676",1342,"      strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride—his","Pride and prejudice"
"23677",1342,"      shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane—his","Pride and prejudice"
"23678",1342,"      unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not","Pride and prejudice"
"23679",1342,"      justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned","Pride and prejudice"
"23680",1342,"      Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to","Pride and prejudice"
"23681",1342,"      deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his","Pride and prejudice"
"23682",1342,"      attachment had for a moment excited. She continued in very","Pride and prejudice"
"23683",1342,"      agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine’s carriage","Pride and prejudice"

"23691",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23692",1342,"      Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and","Pride and prejudice"
"23693",1342,"      meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not","Pride and prejudice"
"23694",1342,"      yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was","Pride and prejudice"
"23695",1342,"      impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for","Pride and prejudice"
"23696",1342,"      employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge","Pride and prejudice"
"23697",1342,"      herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her","Pride and prejudice"
"23698",1342,"      favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s sometimes","Pride and prejudice"
"23699",1342,"      coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she","Pride and prejudice"
"23700",1342,"      turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The","Pride and prejudice"
"23701",1342,"      park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon","Pride and prejudice"
"23702",1342,"      passed one of the gates into the ground.","Pride and prejudice"
"23703",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23704",1342,"      After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she","Pride and prejudice"
"23705",1342,"      was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the","Pride and prejudice"
"23706",1342,"      gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now","Pride and prejudice"
"23707",1342,"      passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and","Pride and prejudice"
"23708",1342,"      every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was","Pride and prejudice"
"23709",1342,"      on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of","Pride and prejudice"
"23710",1342,"      a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was","Pride and prejudice"
"23711",1342,"      moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was","Pride and prejudice"
"23712",1342,"      directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near","Pride and prejudice"
"23713",1342,"      enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,","Pride and prejudice"
"23714",1342,"      pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself","Pride and prejudice"
"23715",1342,"      called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she","Pride and prejudice"
"23716",1342,"      moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it","Pride and prejudice"
"23717",1342,"      also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took,","Pride and prejudice"
"23718",1342,"      said, with a look of haughty composure, “I have been walking in","Pride and prejudice"
"23719",1342,"      the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me","Pride and prejudice"
"23720",1342,"      the honour of reading that letter?” And then, with a slight bow,","Pride and prejudice"
"23721",1342,"      turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.","Pride and prejudice"
"23722",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23723",1342,"      With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest","Pride and prejudice"
"23724",1342,"      curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still","Pride and prejudice"
"23725",1342,"      increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of","Pride and prejudice"
"23726",1342,"      letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The","Pride and prejudice"
"23727",1342,"      envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the","Pride and prejudice"
"23728",1342,"      lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight","Pride and prejudice"
"23729",1342,"      o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:—","Pride and prejudice"
"23730",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23731",1342,"      “Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the","Pride and prejudice"
"23732",1342,"      apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments","Pride and prejudice"
"23733",1342,"      or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to","Pride and prejudice"
"23734",1342,"      you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling","Pride and prejudice"
"23735",1342,"      myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both,","Pride and prejudice"
"23736",1342,"      cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation","Pride and prejudice"
"23737",1342,"      and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been","Pride and prejudice"
"23738",1342,"      spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.","Pride and prejudice"
"23739",1342,"      You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your","Pride and prejudice"
"23740",1342,"      attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but","Pride and prejudice"
"23741",1342,"      I demand it of your justice.","Pride and prejudice"
"23742",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23743",1342,"      “Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of","Pride and prejudice"
"23744",1342,"      equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first","Pride and prejudice"
"23745",1342,"      mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I","Pride and prejudice"
"23746",1342,"      had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I","Pride and prejudice"
"23747",1342,"      had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and","Pride and prejudice"
"23748",1342,"      humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the","Pride and prejudice"
"23749",1342,"      prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown","Pride and prejudice"
"23750",1342,"      off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my","Pride and prejudice"
"23751",1342,"      father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on","Pride and prejudice"
"23752",1342,"      our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its","Pride and prejudice"
"23753",1342,"      exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two","Pride and prejudice"
"23754",1342,"      young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few","Pride and prejudice"
"23755",1342,"      weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that","Pride and prejudice"
"23756",1342,"      blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each","Pride and prejudice"
"23757",1342,"      circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the","Pride and prejudice"
"23758",1342,"      following account of my actions and their motives has been read.","Pride and prejudice"
"23759",1342,"      If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am","Pride and prejudice"
"23760",1342,"      under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive","Pride and prejudice"
"23761",1342,"      to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be","Pride and prejudice"
"23762",1342,"      obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.","Pride and prejudice"
"23763",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23764",1342,"      “I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common","Pride and prejudice"
"23765",1342,"      with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any","Pride and prejudice"
"23766",1342,"      other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening","Pride and prejudice"
"23767",1342,"      of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his","Pride and prejudice"
"23768",1342,"      feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love","Pride and prejudice"
"23769",1342,"      before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you,","Pride and prejudice"
"23770",1342,"      I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental","Pride and prejudice"
"23771",1342,"      information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given","Pride and prejudice"
"23772",1342,"      rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it","Pride and prejudice"
"23773",1342,"      as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.","Pride and prejudice"
"23774",1342,"      From that moment I observed my friend’s behaviour attentively;","Pride and prejudice"
"23775",1342,"      and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was","Pride and prejudice"
"23776",1342,"      beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also","Pride and prejudice"
"23777",1342,"      watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging","Pride and prejudice"
"23778",1342,"      as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I","Pride and prejudice"
"23779",1342,"      remained convinced from the evening’s scrutiny, that though she","Pride and prejudice"
"23780",1342,"      received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by","Pride and prejudice"
"23781",1342,"      any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken","Pride and prejudice"
"23782",1342,"      here, _I_ must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of","Pride and prejudice"
"23783",1342,"      your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have","Pride and prejudice"
"23784",1342,"      been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment","Pride and prejudice"
"23785",1342,"      has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert,","Pride and prejudice"
"23786",1342,"      that the serenity of your sister’s countenance and air was such","Pride and prejudice"
"23787",1342,"      as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that,","Pride and prejudice"
"23788",1342,"      however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily","Pride and prejudice"
"23789",1342,"      touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is","Pride and prejudice"
"23790",1342,"      certain—but I will venture to say that my investigation and","Pride and prejudice"
"23791",1342,"      decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did","Pride and prejudice"
"23792",1342,"      not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed","Pride and prejudice"
"23793",1342,"      it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My","Pride and prejudice"
"23794",1342,"      objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last","Pride and prejudice"
"23795",1342,"      night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion","Pride and prejudice"
"23796",1342,"      to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be","Pride and prejudice"
"23797",1342,"      so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other","Pride and prejudice"
"23798",1342,"      causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and","Pride and prejudice"
"23799",1342,"      existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself","Pride and prejudice"
"23800",1342,"      endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before","Pride and prejudice"
"23801",1342,"      me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of","Pride and prejudice"
"23802",1342,"      your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in","Pride and prejudice"
"23803",1342,"      comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so","Pride and prejudice"
"23804",1342,"      almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger","Pride and prejudice"
"23805",1342,"      sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It","Pride and prejudice"
"23806",1342,"      pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects","Pride and prejudice"
"23807",1342,"      of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this","Pride and prejudice"
"23808",1342,"      representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider","Pride and prejudice"
"23809",1342,"      that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of","Pride and prejudice"
"23810",1342,"      the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and","Pride and prejudice"
"23811",1342,"      your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and","Pride and prejudice"
"23812",1342,"      disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what","Pride and prejudice"
"23813",1342,"      passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and","Pride and prejudice"
"23814",1342,"      every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to","Pride and prejudice"
"23815",1342,"      preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy","Pride and prejudice"
"23816",1342,"      connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,","Pride and prejudice"
"23817",1342,"      as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon","Pride and prejudice"
"23818",1342,"      returning.","Pride and prejudice"
"23819",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"23820",1342,"      “The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters’","Pride and prejudice"
"23821",1342,"      uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence","Pride and prejudice"
"23822",1342,"      of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time","Pride and prejudice"
"23823",1342,"      was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on","Pride and prejudice"
"23824",1342,"      joining him directly in London. We accordingly went—and there I","Pride and prejudice"
"23825",1342,"      readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the","Pride and prejudice"
"23826",1342,"      certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them","Pride and prejudice"
"23827",1342,"      earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or","Pride and prejudice"
"23828",1342,"      delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would","Pride and prejudice"
"23829",1342,"      ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded","Pride and prejudice"
"23830",1342,"      by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s","Pride and prejudice"
"23831",1342,"      indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection","Pride and prejudice"
"23832",1342,"      with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great","Pride and prejudice"
"23833",1342,"      natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than","Pride and prejudice"
"23834",1342,"      on his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived","Pride and prejudice"
"23835",1342,"      himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against","Pride and prejudice"
"23836",1342,"      returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been","Pride and prejudice"
"23837",1342,"      given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself","Pride and prejudice"
"23838",1342,"      for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in","Pride and prejudice"
"23839",1342,"      the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it","Pride and prejudice"
"23840",1342,"      is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to","Pride and prejudice"
"23841",1342,"      conceal from him your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself,","Pride and prejudice"
"23842",1342,"      as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet","Pride and prejudice"
"23843",1342,"      ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence","Pride and prejudice"
"23844",1342,"      is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough","Pride and prejudice"
"23845",1342,"      extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this","Pride and prejudice"
"23846",1342,"      concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however,","Pride and prejudice"
"23847",1342,"      and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more","Pride and prejudice"
"23848",1342,"      to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your","Pride and prejudice"
"23849",1342,"      sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives","Pride and prejudice"
"23850",1342,"      which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient,","Pride and prejudice"
"23851",1342,"      I have not yet learnt to condemn them.","Pride and prejudice"

"23853",1342,"      “With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having","Pride and prejudice"

"23856",1342,"      _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what","Pride and prejudice"

"23874",1342,"      which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best","Pride and prejudice"
"23875",1342,"      friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly","Pride and prejudice"

"23883",1342,"      “My excellent father died about five years ago; and his","Pride and prejudice"
"23884",1342,"      attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his","Pride and prejudice"
"23885",1342,"      will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his","Pride and prejudice"
"23886",1342,"      advancement in the best manner that his profession might","Pride and prejudice"
"23887",1342,"      allow—and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family","Pride and prejudice"
"23888",1342,"      living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a","Pride and prejudice"
"23889",1342,"      legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long","Pride and prejudice"
"23890",1342,"      survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"23891",1342,"      Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against","Pride and prejudice"
"23892",1342,"      taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for","Pride and prejudice"
"23893",1342,"      him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of","Pride and prejudice"
"23894",1342,"      the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some","Pride and prejudice"
"23895",1342,"      intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that","Pride and prejudice"
"23896",1342,"      the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient","Pride and prejudice"
"23897",1342,"      support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be","Pride and prejudice"
"23898",1342,"      sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his","Pride and prejudice"
"23899",1342,"      proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman;","Pride and prejudice"
"23900",1342,"      the business was therefore soon settled—he resigned all claim to","Pride and prejudice"

"23902",1342,"      in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three","Pride and prejudice"
"23903",1342,"      thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved.","Pride and prejudice"
"23904",1342,"      I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his","Pride and prejudice"
"23905",1342,"      society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his","Pride and prejudice"
"23906",1342,"      studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all","Pride and prejudice"
"23907",1342,"      restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For","Pride and prejudice"
"23908",1342,"      about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of","Pride and prejudice"
"23909",1342,"      the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he","Pride and prejudice"
"23910",1342,"      applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His","Pride and prejudice"
"23911",1342,"      circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in","Pride and prejudice"
"23912",1342,"      believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most","Pride and prejudice"
"23913",1342,"      unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being","Pride and prejudice"
"23914",1342,"      ordained, if I would present him to the living in question—of","Pride and prejudice"
"23915",1342,"      which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well","Pride and prejudice"
"23916",1342,"      assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could","Pride and prejudice"
"23917",1342,"      not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will","Pride and prejudice"
"23918",1342,"      hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for","Pride and prejudice"
"23919",1342,"      resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in","Pride and prejudice"
"23920",1342,"      proportion to the distress of his circumstances—and he was","Pride and prejudice"
"23921",1342,"      doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his","Pride and prejudice"
"23922",1342,"      reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of","Pride and prejudice"
"23923",1342,"      acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last","Pride and prejudice"

"23928",1342,"      induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I","Pride and prejudice"
"23929",1342,"      feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten","Pride and prejudice"
"23930",1342,"      years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother’s","Pride and prejudice"
"23931",1342,"      nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she","Pride and prejudice"
"23932",1342,"      was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in","Pride and prejudice"
"23933",1342,"      London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over","Pride and prejudice"
"23934",1342,"      it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly","Pride and prejudice"
"23935",1342,"      by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance","Pride and prejudice"
"23936",1342,"      between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most","Pride and prejudice"
"23937",1342,"      unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far","Pride and prejudice"
"23938",1342,"      recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart","Pride and prejudice"
"23939",1342,"      retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child,","Pride and prejudice"
"23940",1342,"      that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent","Pride and prejudice"
"23941",1342,"      to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her","Pride and prejudice"
"23942",1342,"      excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that","Pride and prejudice"
"23943",1342,"      I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly","Pride and prejudice"
"23944",1342,"      a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana,","Pride and prejudice"
"23945",1342,"      unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother","Pride and prejudice"
"23946",1342,"      whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole","Pride and prejudice"
"23947",1342,"      to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my","Pride and prejudice"
"23948",1342,"      sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I","Pride and prejudice"
"23949",1342,"      wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.","Pride and prejudice"
"23950",1342,"      Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s chief","Pride and prejudice"
"23951",1342,"      object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty","Pride and prejudice"
"23952",1342,"      thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of","Pride and prejudice"
"23953",1342,"      revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge","Pride and prejudice"
"23954",1342,"      would have been complete indeed.","Pride and prejudice"

"23956",1342,"      “This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we","Pride and prejudice"

"23958",1342,"      it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty","Pride and prejudice"
"23959",1342,"      towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form","Pride and prejudice"
"23960",1342,"      of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not","Pride and prejudice"
"23961",1342,"      perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of","Pride and prejudice"

"23968",1342,"      related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of","Pride and prejudice"
"23969",1342,"      Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant","Pride and prejudice"

"23971",1342,"      will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of","Pride and prejudice"

"23989",1342,"      well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a","Pride and prejudice"
"23990",1342,"      contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read","Pride and prejudice"
"23991",1342,"      were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first","Pride and prejudice"
"23992",1342,"      understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and","Pride and prejudice"
"23993",1342,"      steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation","Pride and prejudice"

"23995",1342,"      strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his","Pride and prejudice"
"23996",1342,"      account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an","Pride and prejudice"
"23997",1342,"      eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from","Pride and prejudice"
"23998",1342,"      impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was","Pride and prejudice"
"23999",1342,"      incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.","Pride and prejudice"
"24000",1342,"      His belief of her sister’s insensibility she instantly resolved","Pride and prejudice"
"24001",1342,"      to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to","Pride and prejudice"
"24002",1342,"      the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him","Pride and prejudice"
"24003",1342,"      justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which","Pride and prejudice"
"24004",1342,"      satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was","Pride and prejudice"
"24005",1342,"      all pride and insolence.","Pride and prejudice"
"24006",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24007",1342,"      But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.","Pride and prejudice"

"24009",1342,"      of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion","Pride and prejudice"
"24010",1342,"      of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own","Pride and prejudice"
"24011",1342,"      history of himself—her feelings were yet more acutely painful and","Pride and prejudice"
"24012",1342,"      more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and","Pride and prejudice"
"24013",1342,"      even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely,","Pride and prejudice"
"24014",1342,"      repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false! This cannot be! This","Pride and prejudice"
"24015",1342,"      must be the grossest falsehood!”—and when she had gone through","Pride and prejudice"
"24016",1342,"      the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last","Pride and prejudice"
"24017",1342,"      page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not","Pride and prejudice"

"24020",1342,"      In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on","Pride and prejudice"
"24021",1342,"      nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the","Pride and prejudice"
"24022",1342,"      letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she","Pride and prejudice"
"24023",1342,"      could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related","Pride and prejudice"
"24024",1342,"      to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the","Pride and prejudice"
"24025",1342,"      meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the","Pride and prejudice"
"24026",1342,"      Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the","Pride and prejudice"
"24027",1342,"      kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known","Pride and prejudice"
"24028",1342,"      its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each","Pride and prejudice"
"24029",1342,"      recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the","Pride and prejudice"
"24030",1342,"      difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was","Pride and prejudice"
"24031",1342,"      fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was","Pride and prejudice"
"24032",1342,"      impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side","Pride and prejudice"
"24033",1342,"      or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that","Pride and prejudice"
"24034",1342,"      her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the","Pride and prejudice"
"24035",1342,"      closest attention, the particulars immediately following of","Pride and prejudice"
"24036",1342,"      Wickham’s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his","Pride and prejudice"
"24037",1342,"      receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds,","Pride and prejudice"
"24038",1342,"      again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter,","Pride and prejudice"
"24039",1342,"      weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be","Pride and prejudice"
"24040",1342,"      impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each statement—but","Pride and prejudice"
"24041",1342,"      with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again","Pride and prejudice"
"24042",1342,"      she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair,","Pride and prejudice"
"24043",1342,"      which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could","Pride and prejudice"
"24044",1342,"      so represent as to render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than","Pride and prejudice"
"24045",1342,"      infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely","Pride and prejudice"
"24046",1342,"      blameless throughout the whole.","Pride and prejudice"
"24047",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24048",1342,"      The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to","Pride and prejudice"
"24049",1342,"      lay at Mr. Wickham’s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more","Pride and prejudice"
"24050",1342,"      so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never","Pride and prejudice"
"24051",1342,"      heard of him before his entrance into the ——shire Militia, in","Pride and prejudice"
"24052",1342,"      which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on","Pride and prejudice"
"24053",1342,"      meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight","Pride and prejudice"
"24054",1342,"      acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in","Pride and prejudice"
"24055",1342,"      Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character,","Pride and prejudice"
"24056",1342,"      had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of","Pride and prejudice"
"24057",1342,"      enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him","Pride and prejudice"
"24058",1342,"      at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect","Pride and prejudice"
"24059",1342,"      some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity","Pride and prejudice"
"24060",1342,"      or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"24061",1342,"      Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for","Pride and prejudice"
"24062",1342,"      those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what","Pride and prejudice"
"24063",1342,"      Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’","Pride and prejudice"
"24064",1342,"      continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could","Pride and prejudice"
"24065",1342,"      see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address;","Pride and prejudice"
"24066",1342,"      but she could remember no more substantial good than the general","Pride and prejudice"
"24067",1342,"      approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social","Pride and prejudice"
"24068",1342,"      powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a","Pride and prejudice"
"24069",1342,"      considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas!","Pride and prejudice"
"24070",1342,"      the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received","Pride and prejudice"
"24071",1342,"      some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel","Pride and prejudice"
"24072",1342,"      Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she","Pride and prejudice"
"24073",1342,"      was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel","Pride and prejudice"
"24074",1342,"      Fitzwilliam himself—from whom she had previously received the","Pride and prejudice"
"24075",1342,"      information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs, and","Pride and prejudice"
"24076",1342,"      whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she","Pride and prejudice"
"24077",1342,"      had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked","Pride and prejudice"
"24078",1342,"      by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly","Pride and prejudice"
"24079",1342,"      banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have","Pride and prejudice"
"24080",1342,"      hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his","Pride and prejudice"
"24081",1342,"      cousin’s corroboration.","Pride and prejudice"
"24082",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24083",1342,"      She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in","Pride and prejudice"
"24084",1342,"      conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening","Pride and prejudice"
"24085",1342,"      at Mr. Phillips’s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in","Pride and prejudice"
"24086",1342,"      her memory. She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such","Pride and prejudice"
"24087",1342,"      communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her","Pride and prejudice"
"24088",1342,"      before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he","Pride and prejudice"
"24089",1342,"      had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his","Pride and prejudice"
"24090",1342,"      conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of","Pride and prejudice"
"24091",1342,"      seeing Mr. Darcy—that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that","Pride and prejudice"
"24092",1342,"      _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield","Pride and prejudice"
"24093",1342,"      ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the","Pride and prejudice"
"24094",1342,"      Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story","Pride and prejudice"
"24095",1342,"      to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been","Pride and prejudice"
"24096",1342,"      everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples","Pride and prejudice"
"24097",1342,"      in sinking Mr. Darcy’s character, though he had assured her that","Pride and prejudice"
"24098",1342,"      respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.","Pride and prejudice"
"24099",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24100",1342,"      How differently did everything now appear in which he was","Pride and prejudice"
"24101",1342,"      concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence","Pride and prejudice"
"24102",1342,"      of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of","Pride and prejudice"
"24103",1342,"      her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but","Pride and prejudice"
"24104",1342,"      his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself","Pride and prejudice"
"24105",1342,"      could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been","Pride and prejudice"
"24106",1342,"      deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his","Pride and prejudice"

"24110",1342,"      Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned","Pride and prejudice"
"24111",1342,"      by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair;","Pride and prejudice"
"24112",1342,"      that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in","Pride and prejudice"
"24113",1342,"      the whole course of their acquaintance—an acquaintance which had","Pride and prejudice"
"24114",1342,"      latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of","Pride and prejudice"
"24115",1342,"      intimacy with his ways—seen anything that betrayed him to be","Pride and prejudice"
"24116",1342,"      unprincipled or unjust—anything that spoke him of irreligious or","Pride and prejudice"
"24117",1342,"      immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed","Pride and prejudice"
"24118",1342,"      and valued—that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother,","Pride and prejudice"
"24119",1342,"      and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his","Pride and prejudice"
"24120",1342,"      sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had","Pride and prejudice"
"24121",1342,"      his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a","Pride and prejudice"
"24122",1342,"      violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed","Pride and prejudice"
"24123",1342,"      from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of","Pride and prejudice"

"24125",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24126",1342,"      She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor","Pride and prejudice"
"24127",1342,"      Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind,","Pride and prejudice"
"24128",1342,"      partial, prejudiced, absurd.","Pride and prejudice"
"24129",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"

"24138",1342,"      the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted","Pride and prejudice"

"24141",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24142",1342,"      From herself to Jane—from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a","Pride and prejudice"
"24143",1342,"      line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s","Pride and prejudice"
"24144",1342,"      explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read","Pride and prejudice"
"24145",1342,"      it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.","Pride and prejudice"
"24146",1342,"      How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance,","Pride and prejudice"
"24147",1342,"      which she had been obliged to give in the other? He declared","Pride and prejudice"
"24148",1342,"      himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister’s attachment;","Pride and prejudice"
"24149",1342,"      and she could not help remembering what Charlotte’s opinion had","Pride and prejudice"
"24150",1342,"      always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his","Pride and prejudice"
"24151",1342,"      description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though","Pride and prejudice"
"24152",1342,"      fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant","Pride and prejudice"
"24153",1342,"      complacency in her air and manner not often united with great","Pride and prejudice"

"24156",1342,"      When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were","Pride and prejudice"
"24157",1342,"      mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her","Pride and prejudice"
"24158",1342,"      sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her","Pride and prejudice"
"24159",1342,"      too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he","Pride and prejudice"
"24160",1342,"      particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball,","Pride and prejudice"
"24161",1342,"      and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have","Pride and prejudice"

"24167",1342,"      considered that Jane’s disappointment had in fact been the work","Pride and prejudice"
"24168",1342,"      of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit","Pride and prejudice"
"24169",1342,"      of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt","Pride and prejudice"

"24172",1342,"      After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every","Pride and prejudice"

"24186",1342,"      Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she","Pride and prejudice"

"24216",1342,"      am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be","Pride and prejudice"
"24217",1342,"      so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so","Pride and prejudice"
"24218",1342,"      they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably","Pride and prejudice"
"24219",1342,"      till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,","Pride and prejudice"
"24220",1342,"      more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings","Pride and prejudice"

"24222",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24223",1342,"      Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,","Pride and prejudice"

"24257",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24258",1342,"      Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a","Pride and prejudice"

"24260",1342,"      bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.","Pride and prejudice"
"24261",1342,"      It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have","Pride and prejudice"
"24262",1342,"      the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young","Pride and prejudice"
"24263",1342,"      women should always be properly guarded and attended, according","Pride and prejudice"
"24264",1342,"      to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to","Pride and prejudice"
"24265",1342,"      Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two","Pride and prejudice"

"24267",1342,"      of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with","Pride and prejudice"
"24268",1342,"      propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to","Pride and prejudice"
"24269",1342,"      all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.","Pride and prejudice"
"24270",1342,"      Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would","Pride and prejudice"

"24283",1342,"      with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.","Pride and prejudice"
"24284",1342,"      Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was","Pride and prejudice"

"24288",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24289",1342,"      Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by","Pride and prejudice"
"24290",1342,"      heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its","Pride and prejudice"
"24291",1342,"      writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the","Pride and prejudice"
"24292",1342,"      style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when","Pride and prejudice"
"24293",1342,"      she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him,","Pride and prejudice"
"24294",1342,"      her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed","Pride and prejudice"
"24295",1342,"      feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited","Pride and prejudice"
"24296",1342,"      gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not","Pride and prejudice"
"24297",1342,"      approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or","Pride and prejudice"
"24298",1342,"      feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own","Pride and prejudice"
"24299",1342,"      past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and","Pride and prejudice"
"24300",1342,"      regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of","Pride and prejudice"
"24301",1342,"      yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father,","Pride and prejudice"
"24302",1342,"      contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to","Pride and prejudice"
"24303",1342,"      restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her","Pride and prejudice"
"24304",1342,"      mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely","Pride and prejudice"
"24305",1342,"      insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane","Pride and prejudice"
"24306",1342,"      in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia;","Pride and prejudice"
"24307",1342,"      but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence, what","Pride and prejudice"
"24308",1342,"      chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,","Pride and prejudice"
"24309",1342,"      irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always","Pride and prejudice"
"24310",1342,"      affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless,","Pride and prejudice"
"24311",1342,"      would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and","Pride and prejudice"
"24312",1342,"      vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt","Pride and prejudice"
"24313",1342,"      with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they","Pride and prejudice"
"24314",1342,"      would be going there forever.","Pride and prejudice"
"24315",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24316",1342,"      Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"24317",1342,"      Darcy’s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good","Pride and prejudice"
"24318",1342,"      opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His","Pride and prejudice"
"24319",1342,"      affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct","Pride and prejudice"
"24320",1342,"      cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness","Pride and prejudice"
"24321",1342,"      of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the","Pride and prejudice"
"24322",1342,"      thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so","Pride and prejudice"
"24323",1342,"      replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been","Pride and prejudice"

"24325",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24326",1342,"      When to these recollections was added the development of","Pride and prejudice"

"24329",1342,"      affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear","Pride and prejudice"

"24332",1342,"      Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last","Pride and prejudice"

"24334",1342,"      was spent there; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into","Pride and prejudice"
"24335",1342,"      the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the","Pride and prejudice"
"24336",1342,"      best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of","Pride and prejudice"

"24601",1342,"      the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was enquiring of","Pride and prejudice"
"24602",1342,"      Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.","Pride and prejudice"
"24603",1342,"      Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of","Pride and prejudice"
"24604",1342,"      the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and,","Pride and prejudice"
"24605",1342,"      on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and","Pride and prejudice"
"24606",1342,"      Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person’s, was","Pride and prejudice"
"24607",1342,"      enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who","Pride and prejudice"

"24609",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24610",1342,"      “Oh! Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had","Pride and prejudice"
"24611",1342,"      such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and","Pride and prejudice"
"24612",1342,"      pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone","Pride and prejudice"
"24613",1342,"      so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to","Pride and prejudice"
"24614",1342,"      the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated","Pride and prejudice"
"24615",1342,"      the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and","Pride and prejudice"
"24616",1342,"      if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then","Pride and prejudice"
"24617",1342,"      when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have","Pride and prejudice"
"24618",1342,"      got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we","Pride and prejudice"
"24619",1342,"      were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud,","Pride and prejudice"
"24620",1342,"      that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”","Pride and prejudice"
"24621",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24622",1342,"      To this Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear","Pride and prejudice"
"24623",1342,"      sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be","Pride and prejudice"
"24624",1342,"      congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they","Pride and prejudice"

"24626",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24627",1342,"      But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to","Pride and prejudice"

"24630",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24631",1342,"      In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to","Pride and prejudice"
"24632",1342,"      walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth","Pride and prejudice"
"24633",1342,"      steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss","Pride and prejudice"
"24634",1342,"      Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in","Pride and prejudice"
"24635",1342,"      pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her","Pride and prejudice"
"24636",1342,"      opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was","Pride and prejudice"
"24637",1342,"      resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to _her_ of","Pride and prejudice"
"24638",1342,"      the regiment’s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression.","Pride and prejudice"
"24639",1342,"      In a fortnight they were to go—and once gone, she hoped there","Pride and prejudice"
"24640",1342,"      could be nothing more to plague her on his account.","Pride and prejudice"
"24641",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24642",1342,"      She had not been many hours at home before she found that the","Pride and prejudice"
"24643",1342,"      Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn,","Pride and prejudice"
"24644",1342,"      was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw","Pride and prejudice"
"24645",1342,"      directly that her father had not the smallest intention of","Pride and prejudice"
"24646",1342,"      yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and","Pride and prejudice"
"24647",1342,"      equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never","Pride and prejudice"

"24658",1342,"      her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the","Pride and prejudice"

"24663",1342,"      perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other","Pride and prejudice"

"24665",1342,"      sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but","Pride and prejudice"
"24666",1342,"      still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister’s","Pride and prejudice"

"24668",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24669",1342,"      “His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and","Pride and prejudice"

"24685",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24686",1342,"      She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents","Pride and prejudice"
"24687",1342,"      as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this","Pride and prejudice"
"24688",1342,"      for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world","Pride and prejudice"
"24689",1342,"      without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole","Pride and prejudice"

"24691",1342,"      Darcy’s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of","Pride and prejudice"
"24692",1342,"      consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour","Pride and prejudice"
"24693",1342,"      to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one","Pride and prejudice"

"24754",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24755",1342,"      Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can","Pride and prejudice"

"24781",1342,"      still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the","Pride and prejudice"

"24783",1342,"      letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been","Pride and prejudice"
"24784",1342,"      valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could","Pride and prejudice"

"24795",1342,"      cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even","Pride and prejudice"
"24796",1342,"      fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of","Pride and prejudice"
"24797",1342,"      first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater","Pride and prejudice"
"24798",1342,"      steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so","Pride and prejudice"

"24807",1342,"      determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my","Pride and prejudice"
"24808",1342,"      sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane","Pride and prejudice"
"24809",1342,"      saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving","Pride and prejudice"

"24822",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"24823",1342,"      But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such","Pride and prejudice"

"24976",1342,"      to less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three—very","Pride and prejudice"
"24977",1342,"      silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does","Pride and prejudice"
"24978",1342,"      not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a","Pride and prejudice"
"24979",1342,"      sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she","Pride and prejudice"
"24980",1342,"      is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At","Pride and prejudice"
"24981",1342,"      Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt","Pride and prejudice"
"24982",1342,"      than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth","Pride and prejudice"
"24983",1342,"      their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may","Pride and prejudice"

"24990",1342,"      sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her","Pride and prejudice"
"24991",1342,"      vexations by dwelling on them. She was confident of having","Pride and prejudice"
"24992",1342,"      performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or","Pride and prejudice"

"25001",1342,"      the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present","Pride and prejudice"

"25018",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25019",1342,"      Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having","Pride and prejudice"
"25020",1342,"      been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation","Pride and prejudice"
"25021",1342,"      was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality","Pride and prejudice"
"25022",1342,"      entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very","Pride and prejudice"
"25023",1342,"      gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a","Pride and prejudice"
"25024",1342,"      sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to","Pride and prejudice"
"25025",1342,"      herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the","Pride and prejudice"

"25027",1342,"      had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve,","Pride and prejudice"
"25028",1342,"      after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern","Pride and prejudice"
"25029",1342,"      for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such","Pride and prejudice"
"25030",1342,"      idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed","Pride and prejudice"

"25032",1342,"      that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had","Pride and prejudice"
"25033",1342,"      been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference","Pride and prejudice"

"25040",1342,"      passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"25041",1342,"      Darcy’s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him,","Pride and prejudice"

"25043",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25044",1342,"      He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment’s","Pride and prejudice"
"25045",1342,"      recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly","Pride and prejudice"
"25046",1342,"      seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very","Pride and prejudice"
"25047",1342,"      gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer","Pride and prejudice"
"25048",1342,"      was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon","Pride and prejudice"
"25049",1342,"      afterwards added:","Pride and prejudice"

"25070",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25071",1342,"      “Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very","Pride and prejudice"

"25076",1342,"      something in her countenance which made him listen with an","Pride and prejudice"

"25092",1342,"      direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others,","Pride and prejudice"
"25093",1342,"      for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have","Pride and prejudice"
"25094",1342,"      suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which","Pride and prejudice"
"25095",1342,"      you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his","Pride and prejudice"
"25096",1342,"      visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands","Pride and prejudice"
"25097",1342,"      much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when","Pride and prejudice"
"25098",1342,"      they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish","Pride and prejudice"
"25099",1342,"      of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain","Pride and prejudice"

"25102",1342,"      Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered","Pride and prejudice"
"25103",1342,"      only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted","Pride and prejudice"
"25104",1342,"      to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was","Pride and prejudice"
"25105",1342,"      in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with","Pride and prejudice"

"25277",1342,"      she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they","Pride and prejudice"
"25278",1342,"      bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of","Pride and prejudice"
"25279",1342,"      the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found","Pride and prejudice"
"25280",1342,"      from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their","Pride and prejudice"
"25281",1342,"      direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking","Pride and prejudice"
"25282",1342,"      over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an","Pride and prejudice"
"25283",1342,"      inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his","Pride and prejudice"

"25286",1342,"      “My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have","Pride and prejudice"

"25288",1342,"      of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth","Pride and prejudice"

"25290",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25291",1342,"      Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at","Pride and prejudice"
"25292",1342,"      Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing","Pride and prejudice"
"25293",1342,"      it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after","Pride and prejudice"
"25294",1342,"      going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or","Pride and prejudice"

"25296",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25297",1342,"      Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine","Pride and prejudice"
"25298",1342,"      house richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it","Pride and prejudice"
"25299",1342,"      myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the","Pride and prejudice"

"25301",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25302",1342,"      Elizabeth said no more—but her mind could not acquiesce. The","Pride and prejudice"
"25303",1342,"      possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,","Pride and prejudice"
"25304",1342,"      instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very","Pride and prejudice"
"25305",1342,"      idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt","Pride and prejudice"
"25306",1342,"      than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections;","Pride and prejudice"
"25307",1342,"      and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if","Pride and prejudice"
"25308",1342,"      her private enquiries to the absence of the family were","Pride and prejudice"

"25312",1342,"      whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name","Pride and prejudice"
"25313",1342,"      of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family","Pride and prejudice"
"25314",1342,"      were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the","Pride and prejudice"
"25315",1342,"      last question—and her alarms now being removed, she was at","Pride and prejudice"
"25316",1342,"      leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house","Pride and prejudice"
"25317",1342,"      herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and","Pride and prejudice"
"25318",1342,"      she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper","Pride and prejudice"
"25319",1342,"      air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the","Pride and prejudice"

"25327",1342,"      Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance","Pride and prejudice"
"25328",1342,"      of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length","Pride and prejudice"
"25329",1342,"      they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.","Pride and prejudice"
"25330",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25331",1342,"      The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.","Pride and prejudice"
"25332",1342,"      They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some","Pride and prejudice"
"25333",1342,"      time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.","Pride and prejudice"
"25334",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25335",1342,"      Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and","Pride and prejudice"
"25336",1342,"      admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually","Pride and prejudice"
"25337",1342,"      ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of","Pride and prejudice"
"25338",1342,"      a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was","Pride and prejudice"
"25339",1342,"      instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite","Pride and prejudice"
"25340",1342,"      side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.","Pride and prejudice"
"25341",1342,"      It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising","Pride and prejudice"
"25342",1342,"      ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front,","Pride and prejudice"
"25343",1342,"      a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but","Pride and prejudice"
"25344",1342,"      without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal","Pride and prejudice"
"25345",1342,"      nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen","Pride and prejudice"
"25346",1342,"      a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty","Pride and prejudice"
"25347",1342,"      had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were","Pride and prejudice"
"25348",1342,"      all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt","Pride and prejudice"
"25349",1342,"      that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!","Pride and prejudice"
"25350",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25351",1342,"      They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the","Pride and prejudice"

"25353",1342,"      her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest","Pride and prejudice"
"25354",1342,"      the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place,","Pride and prejudice"
"25355",1342,"      they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited","Pride and prejudice"
"25356",1342,"      for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she","Pride and prejudice"
"25357",1342,"      was.","Pride and prejudice"
"25358",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25359",1342,"      The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much","Pride and prejudice"
"25360",1342,"      less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding","Pride and prejudice"
"25361",1342,"      her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large,","Pride and prejudice"
"25362",1342,"      well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after","Pride and prejudice"
"25363",1342,"      slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.","Pride and prejudice"
"25364",1342,"      The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving","Pride and prejudice"
"25365",1342,"      increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.","Pride and prejudice"
"25366",1342,"      Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the","Pride and prejudice"

"25368",1342,"      winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with","Pride and prejudice"
"25369",1342,"      delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were","Pride and prejudice"
"25370",1342,"      taking different positions; but from every window there were","Pride and prejudice"
"25371",1342,"      beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their","Pride and prejudice"
"25372",1342,"      furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but","Pride and prejudice"
"25373",1342,"      Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither","Pride and prejudice"
"25374",1342,"      gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real","Pride and prejudice"
"25375",1342,"      elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.","Pride and prejudice"

"25384",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25385",1342,"      This was a lucky recollection—it saved her from something very","Pride and prejudice"
"25386",1342,"      like regret.","Pride and prejudice"
"25387",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25388",1342,"      She longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master was","Pride and prejudice"
"25389",1342,"      really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however,","Pride and prejudice"
"25390",1342,"      the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with","Pride and prejudice"
"25391",1342,"      alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, “But we","Pride and prejudice"
"25392",1342,"      expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends.” How","Pride and prejudice"
"25393",1342,"      rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any","Pride and prejudice"

"25395",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25396",1342,"      Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and","Pride and prejudice"
"25397",1342,"      saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other","Pride and prejudice"
"25398",1342,"      miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly,","Pride and prejudice"
"25399",1342,"      how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it","Pride and prejudice"
"25400",1342,"      was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s","Pride and prejudice"
"25401",1342,"      steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense. “He","Pride and prejudice"
"25402",1342,"      is now gone into the army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has","Pride and prejudice"
"25403",1342,"      turned out very wild.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25404",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25405",1342,"      Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth","Pride and prejudice"

"25407",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25408",1342,"      “And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the","Pride and prejudice"
"25409",1342,"      miniatures, “is my master—and very like him. It was drawn at the","Pride and prejudice"
"25410",1342,"      same time as the other—about eight years ago.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25411",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25412",1342,"      “I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs.","Pride and prejudice"

"25415",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25416",1342,"      Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this","Pride and prejudice"

"25418",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25419",1342,"      “Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”","Pride and prejudice"
"25420",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25421",1342,"      Elizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25422",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25423",1342,"      “And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”","Pride and prejudice"
"25424",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25425",1342,"      “Yes, very handsome.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25426",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25427",1342,"      “I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up","Pride and prejudice"
"25428",1342,"      stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.","Pride and prejudice"
"25429",1342,"      This room was my late master’s favourite room, and these","Pride and prejudice"
"25430",1342,"      miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of","Pride and prejudice"
"25431",1342,"      them.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25432",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25433",1342,"      This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.","Pride and prejudice"
"25434",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25435",1342,"      Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy,","Pride and prejudice"

"25437",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"

"25443",1342,"      is a new instrument just come down for her—a present from my","Pride and prejudice"

"25446",1342,"      Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant,","Pride and prejudice"
"25447",1342,"      encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks;","Pride and prejudice"
"25448",1342,"      Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great","Pride and prejudice"
"25449",1342,"      pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.","Pride and prejudice"

"25456",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25457",1342,"      “Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”","Pride and prejudice"

"25463",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25464",1342,"      Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying,","Pride and prejudice"
"25465",1342,"      “It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think","Pride and prejudice"
"25466",1342,"      so.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25467",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25468",1342,"      “I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows","Pride and prejudice"
"25469",1342,"      him,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty","Pride and prejudice"
"25470",1342,"      far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the","Pride and prejudice"
"25471",1342,"      housekeeper added, “I have never known a cross word from him in","Pride and prejudice"
"25472",1342,"      my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25473",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25474",1342,"      This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite","Pride and prejudice"
"25475",1342,"      to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her","Pride and prejudice"
"25476",1342,"      firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed","Pride and prejudice"
"25477",1342,"      to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:","Pride and prejudice"
"25478",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25479",1342,"      “There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are","Pride and prejudice"
"25480",1342,"      lucky in having such a master.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25481",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25482",1342,"      “Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I","Pride and prejudice"
"25483",1342,"      could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that","Pride and prejudice"
"25484",1342,"      they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when","Pride and prejudice"
"25485",1342,"      they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most","Pride and prejudice"

"25487",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25488",1342,"      Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought","Pride and prejudice"
"25489",1342,"      she.","Pride and prejudice"
"25490",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25491",1342,"      “His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.","Pride and prejudice"
"25492",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25493",1342,"      “Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like","Pride and prejudice"
"25494",1342,"      him—just as affable to the poor.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25495",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25496",1342,"      Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for","Pride and prejudice"
"25497",1342,"      more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She","Pride and prejudice"
"25498",1342,"      related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the","Pride and prejudice"
"25499",1342,"      rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner,","Pride and prejudice"
"25500",1342,"      highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he","Pride and prejudice"
"25501",1342,"      attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led","Pride and prejudice"
"25502",1342,"      again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many","Pride and prejudice"
"25503",1342,"      merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.","Pride and prejudice"
"25504",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25505",1342,"      “He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that","Pride and prejudice"
"25506",1342,"      ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of","Pride and prejudice"
"25507",1342,"      nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or","Pride and prejudice"
"25508",1342,"      servants but will give him a good name. Some people call him","Pride and prejudice"
"25509",1342,"      proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it","Pride and prejudice"
"25510",1342,"      is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25511",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25512",1342,"      “In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought","Pride and prejudice"
"25513",1342,"      Elizabeth.","Pride and prejudice"
"25514",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25515",1342,"      “This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked,","Pride and prejudice"
"25516",1342,"      “is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25517",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25518",1342,"      “Perhaps we might be deceived.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25519",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25520",1342,"      “That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25521",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25522",1342,"      On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very","Pride and prejudice"
"25523",1342,"      pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and","Pride and prejudice"
"25524",1342,"      lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it","Pride and prejudice"
"25525",1342,"      was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a","Pride and prejudice"
"25526",1342,"      liking to the room when last at Pemberley.","Pride and prejudice"
"25527",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25528",1342,"      “He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked","Pride and prejudice"
"25529",1342,"      towards one of the windows.","Pride and prejudice"
"25530",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25531",1342,"      Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should","Pride and prejudice"
"25532",1342,"      enter the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added.","Pride and prejudice"
"25533",1342,"      “Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in","Pride and prejudice"
"25534",1342,"      a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25535",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25536",1342,"      The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,","Pride and prejudice"
"25537",1342,"      were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good","Pride and prejudice"
"25538",1342,"      paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such","Pride and prejudice"
"25539",1342,"      as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to","Pride and prejudice"
"25540",1342,"      look at some drawings of Miss Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects","Pride and prejudice"
"25541",1342,"      were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.","Pride and prejudice"
"25542",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25543",1342,"      In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could","Pride and prejudice"
"25544",1342,"      have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked","Pride and prejudice"
"25545",1342,"      in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.","Pride and prejudice"
"25546",1342,"      At last it arrested her—and she beheld a striking resemblance to","Pride and prejudice"
"25547",1342,"      Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to","Pride and prejudice"
"25548",1342,"      have sometimes seen when he looked at her. She stood several","Pride and prejudice"
"25549",1342,"      minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and","Pride and prejudice"
"25550",1342,"      returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs.","Pride and prejudice"
"25551",1342,"      Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father’s","Pride and prejudice"
"25552",1342,"      lifetime.","Pride and prejudice"
"25553",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25554",1342,"      There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more","Pride and prejudice"
"25555",1342,"      gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at","Pride and prejudice"
"25556",1342,"      the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on","Pride and prejudice"
"25557",1342,"      him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is","Pride and prejudice"
"25558",1342,"      more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a","Pride and prejudice"
"25559",1342,"      brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people’s","Pride and prejudice"
"25560",1342,"      happiness were in his guardianship!—how much of pleasure or pain","Pride and prejudice"
"25561",1342,"      was it in his power to bestow!—how much of good or evil must be","Pride and prejudice"
"25562",1342,"      done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the","Pride and prejudice"
"25563",1342,"      housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood","Pride and prejudice"
"25564",1342,"      before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes","Pride and prejudice"
"25565",1342,"      upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment","Pride and prejudice"
"25566",1342,"      of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its","Pride and prejudice"
"25567",1342,"      warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.","Pride and prejudice"
"25568",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25569",1342,"      When all of the house that was open to general inspection had","Pride and prejudice"
"25570",1342,"      been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the","Pride and prejudice"
"25571",1342,"      housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at","Pride and prejudice"
"25572",1342,"      the hall-door.","Pride and prejudice"
"25573",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25574",1342,"      As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth","Pride and prejudice"
"25575",1342,"      turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and","Pride and prejudice"
"25576",1342,"      while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building,","Pride and prejudice"
"25577",1342,"      the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road,","Pride and prejudice"
"25578",1342,"      which led behind it to the stables.","Pride and prejudice"
"25579",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25580",1342,"      They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was","Pride and prejudice"
"25581",1342,"      his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their","Pride and prejudice"
"25582",1342,"      eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with","Pride and prejudice"
"25583",1342,"      the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed","Pride and prejudice"
"25584",1342,"      immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced","Pride and prejudice"
"25585",1342,"      towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of","Pride and prejudice"
"25586",1342,"      perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.","Pride and prejudice"
"25587",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25588",1342,"      She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,","Pride and prejudice"
"25589",1342,"      received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be","Pride and prejudice"
"25590",1342,"      overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the","Pride and prejudice"
"25591",1342,"      picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure","Pride and prejudice"
"25592",1342,"      the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s","Pride and prejudice"
"25593",1342,"      expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately","Pride and prejudice"
"25594",1342,"      have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to","Pride and prejudice"
"25595",1342,"      their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift","Pride and prejudice"
"25596",1342,"      her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to","Pride and prejudice"
"25597",1342,"      his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of","Pride and prejudice"
"25598",1342,"      his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered","Pride and prejudice"
"25599",1342,"      was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the","Pride and prejudice"
"25600",1342,"      impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the","Pride and prejudice"
"25601",1342,"      few minutes in which they continued were some of the most","Pride and prejudice"
"25602",1342,"      uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease;","Pride and prejudice"
"25603",1342,"      when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and","Pride and prejudice"
"25604",1342,"      he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left","Pride and prejudice"
"25605",1342,"      Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so","Pride and prejudice"
"25606",1342,"      hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.","Pride and prejudice"
"25607",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25608",1342,"      At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a","Pride and prejudice"
"25609",1342,"      few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected","Pride and prejudice"
"25610",1342,"      himself, and took leave.","Pride and prejudice"
"25611",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25612",1342,"      The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his","Pride and prejudice"
"25613",1342,"      figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by","Pride and prejudice"
"25614",1342,"      her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered","Pride and prejudice"
"25615",1342,"      by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate,","Pride and prejudice"
"25616",1342,"      the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must","Pride and prejudice"
"25617",1342,"      appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so","Pride and prejudice"
"25618",1342,"      vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself","Pride and prejudice"
"25619",1342,"      in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come","Pride and prejudice"
"25620",1342,"      a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes","Pride and prejudice"
"25621",1342,"      sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his","Pride and prejudice"
"25622",1342,"      discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment","Pride and prejudice"
"25623",1342,"      arrived—that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She","Pride and prejudice"
"25624",1342,"      blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And","Pride and prejudice"
"25625",1342,"      his behaviour, so strikingly altered—what could it mean? That he","Pride and prejudice"
"25626",1342,"      should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak with such","Pride and prejudice"
"25627",1342,"      civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she","Pride and prejudice"
"25628",1342,"      seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with","Pride and prejudice"
"25629",1342,"      such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast","Pride and prejudice"
"25630",1342,"      did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his","Pride and prejudice"
"25631",1342,"      letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to","Pride and prejudice"
"25632",1342,"      account for it.","Pride and prejudice"
"25633",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25634",1342,"      They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,","Pride and prejudice"
"25635",1342,"      and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a","Pride and prejudice"
"25636",1342,"      finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it","Pride and prejudice"
"25637",1342,"      was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and,","Pride and prejudice"
"25638",1342,"      though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her","Pride and prejudice"
"25639",1342,"      uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as","Pride and prejudice"
"25640",1342,"      they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her","Pride and prejudice"
"25641",1342,"      thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House,","Pride and prejudice"
"25642",1342,"      whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to","Pride and prejudice"
"25643",1342,"      know what at the moment was passing in his mind—in what manner he","Pride and prejudice"
"25644",1342,"      thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was","Pride and prejudice"
"25645",1342,"      still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt","Pride and prejudice"
"25646",1342,"      himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was","Pride and prejudice"
"25647",1342,"      not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in","Pride and prejudice"
"25648",1342,"      seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her","Pride and prejudice"
"25649",1342,"      with composure.","Pride and prejudice"
"25650",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25651",1342,"      At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence","Pride and prejudice"
"25652",1342,"      of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more","Pride and prejudice"
"25653",1342,"      like herself.","Pride and prejudice"
"25654",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25655",1342,"      They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a","Pride and prejudice"
"25656",1342,"      while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where","Pride and prejudice"
"25657",1342,"      the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many","Pride and prejudice"
"25658",1342,"      charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long","Pride and prejudice"
"25659",1342,"      range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the","Pride and prejudice"
"25660",1342,"      stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole","Pride and prejudice"
"25661",1342,"      park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant","Pride and prejudice"
"25662",1342,"      smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the","Pride and prejudice"
"25663",1342,"      matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought","Pride and prejudice"
"25664",1342,"      them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to","Pride and prejudice"
"25665",1342,"      the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They","Pride and prejudice"
"25666",1342,"      crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air","Pride and prejudice"
"25667",1342,"      of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet","Pride and prejudice"
"25668",1342,"      visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed","Pride and prejudice"
"25669",1342,"      room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough","Pride and prejudice"
"25670",1342,"      coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its","Pride and prejudice"
"25671",1342,"      windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived","Pride and prejudice"
"25672",1342,"      their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great","Pride and prejudice"
"25673",1342,"      walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the","Pride and prejudice"
"25674",1342,"      carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore,","Pride and prejudice"
"25675",1342,"      obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on","Pride and prejudice"
"25676",1342,"      the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but","Pride and prejudice"
"25677",1342,"      their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to","Pride and prejudice"
"25678",1342,"      indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much","Pride and prejudice"
"25679",1342,"      engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in","Pride and prejudice"
"25680",1342,"      the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced","Pride and prejudice"
"25681",1342,"      but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were","Pride and prejudice"
"25682",1342,"      again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was quite equal to","Pride and prejudice"
"25683",1342,"      what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching","Pride and prejudice"
"25684",1342,"      them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less","Pride and prejudice"
"25685",1342,"      sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before","Pride and prejudice"
"25686",1342,"      they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more","Pride and prejudice"
"25687",1342,"      prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and","Pride and prejudice"
"25688",1342,"      to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a","Pride and prejudice"
"25689",1342,"      few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into","Pride and prejudice"
"25690",1342,"      some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk","Pride and prejudice"
"25691",1342,"      concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was","Pride and prejudice"
"25692",1342,"      immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost","Pride and prejudice"
"25693",1342,"      none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she","Pride and prejudice"
"25694",1342,"      began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she","Pride and prejudice"
"25695",1342,"      had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when","Pride and prejudice"
"25696",1342,"      some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise","Pride and prejudice"
"25697",1342,"      of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her","Pride and prejudice"
"25698",1342,"      colour changed, and she said no more.","Pride and prejudice"
"25699",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25700",1342,"      Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,","Pride and prejudice"
"25701",1342,"      he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to","Pride and prejudice"
"25702",1342,"      her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was","Pride and prejudice"
"25703",1342,"      quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his","Pride and prejudice"
"25704",1342,"      being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people","Pride and prejudice"
"25705",1342,"      against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself.","Pride and prejudice"
"25706",1342,"      “What will be his surprise,” thought she, “when he knows who they","Pride and prejudice"
"25707",1342,"      are? He takes them now for people of fashion.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25708",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25709",1342,"      The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named","Pride and prejudice"
"25710",1342,"      their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to","Pride and prejudice"
"25711",1342,"      see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his","Pride and prejudice"
"25712",1342,"      decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.","Pride and prejudice"
"25713",1342,"      That he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he","Pride and prejudice"
"25714",1342,"      sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going","Pride and prejudice"
"25715",1342,"      away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with","Pride and prejudice"
"25716",1342,"      Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but","Pride and prejudice"
"25717",1342,"      triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some","Pride and prejudice"
"25718",1342,"      relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most","Pride and prejudice"
"25719",1342,"      attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every","Pride and prejudice"
"25720",1342,"      expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his","Pride and prejudice"
"25721",1342,"      intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.","Pride and prejudice"
"25722",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25723",1342,"      The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"25724",1342,"      Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as","Pride and prejudice"
"25725",1342,"      often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood,","Pride and prejudice"
"25726",1342,"      offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and","Pride and prejudice"
"25727",1342,"      pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually","Pride and prejudice"
"25728",1342,"      most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with","Pride and prejudice"
"25729",1342,"      Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said","Pride and prejudice"
"25730",1342,"      nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be","Pride and prejudice"
"25731",1342,"      all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and","Pride and prejudice"
"25732",1342,"      continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what","Pride and prejudice"
"25733",1342,"      can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_—it cannot be for _my_ sake","Pride and prejudice"
"25734",1342,"      that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could","Pride and prejudice"
"25735",1342,"      not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should","Pride and prejudice"
"25736",1342,"      still love me.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25737",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25738",1342,"      After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the","Pride and prejudice"
"25739",1342,"      two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending","Pride and prejudice"
"25740",1342,"      to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some","Pride and prejudice"
"25741",1342,"      curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It","Pride and prejudice"
"25742",1342,"      originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the","Pride and prejudice"
"25743",1342,"      morning, found Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and","Pride and prejudice"
"25744",1342,"      consequently preferred her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by","Pride and prejudice"
"25745",1342,"      her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence,","Pride and prejudice"
"25746",1342,"      the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been","Pride and prejudice"
"25747",1342,"      assured of his absence before she came to the place, and","Pride and prejudice"
"25748",1342,"      accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very","Pride and prejudice"
"25749",1342,"      unexpected—“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that","Pride and prejudice"
"25750",1342,"      you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed,","Pride and prejudice"
"25751",1342,"      before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not","Pride and prejudice"
"25752",1342,"      immediately expected in the country.” He acknowledged the truth","Pride and prejudice"
"25753",1342,"      of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned","Pride and prejudice"
"25754",1342,"      his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with","Pride and prejudice"
"25755",1342,"      whom he had been travelling. “They will join me early to-morrow,”","Pride and prejudice"
"25756",1342,"      he continued, “and among them are some who will claim an","Pride and prejudice"
"25757",1342,"      acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25758",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25759",1342,"      Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were","Pride and prejudice"
"25760",1342,"      instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had","Pride and prejudice"
"25761",1342,"      been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by","Pride and prejudice"
"25762",1342,"      his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.","Pride and prejudice"
"25763",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25764",1342,"      “There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after","Pride and prejudice"
"25765",1342,"      a pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will","Pride and prejudice"
"25766",1342,"      you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to","Pride and prejudice"
"25767",1342,"      your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?”","Pride and prejudice"
"25768",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25769",1342,"      The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too","Pride and prejudice"
"25770",1342,"      great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She","Pride and prejudice"
"25771",1342,"      immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of","Pride and prejudice"
"25772",1342,"      being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,","Pride and prejudice"
"25773",1342,"      without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying","Pride and prejudice"
"25774",1342,"      to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of","Pride and prejudice"
"25775",1342,"      her.","Pride and prejudice"
"25776",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25777",1342,"      They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.","Pride and prejudice"
"25778",1342,"      Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was","Pride and prejudice"
"25779",1342,"      flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her","Pride and prejudice"
"25780",1342,"      was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the","Pride and prejudice"
"25781",1342,"      others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.","Pride and prejudice"
"25782",1342,"      Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.","Pride and prejudice"
"25783",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25784",1342,"      He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself","Pride and prejudice"
"25785",1342,"      not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time","Pride and prejudice"
"25786",1342,"      much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She","Pride and prejudice"
"25787",1342,"      wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every","Pride and prejudice"
"25788",1342,"      subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling,","Pride and prejudice"
"25789",1342,"      and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.","Pride and prejudice"
"25790",1342,"      Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas","Pride and prejudice"
"25791",1342,"      were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.","Pride and prejudice"
"25792",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25793",1342,"      On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go","Pride and prejudice"
"25794",1342,"      into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined,","Pride and prejudice"
"25795",1342,"      and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy","Pride and prejudice"
"25796",1342,"      handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off,","Pride and prejudice"
"25797",1342,"      Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.","Pride and prejudice"
"25798",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25799",1342,"      The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of","Pride and prejudice"
"25800",1342,"      them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they","Pride and prejudice"
"25801",1342,"      had expected. “He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and","Pride and prejudice"
"25802",1342,"      unassuming,” said her uncle.","Pride and prejudice"
"25803",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25804",1342,"      “There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,”","Pride and prejudice"
"25805",1342,"      replied her aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not","Pride and prejudice"
"25806",1342,"      unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some","Pride and prejudice"
"25807",1342,"      people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25808",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25809",1342,"      “I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was","Pride and prejudice"
"25810",1342,"      more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no","Pride and prejudice"
"25811",1342,"      necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was","Pride and prejudice"
"25812",1342,"      very trifling.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25813",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25814",1342,"      “To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as","Pride and prejudice"
"25815",1342,"      Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his","Pride and prejudice"
"25816",1342,"      features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he","Pride and prejudice"
"25817",1342,"      was so disagreeable?”","Pride and prejudice"
"25818",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25819",1342,"      Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had","Pride and prejudice"
"25820",1342,"      liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that","Pride and prejudice"
"25821",1342,"      she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.","Pride and prejudice"
"25822",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25823",1342,"      “But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,”","Pride and prejudice"
"25824",1342,"      replied her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I","Pride and prejudice"
"25825",1342,"      shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind","Pride and prejudice"
"25826",1342,"      another day, and warn me off his grounds.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25827",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25828",1342,"      Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his","Pride and prejudice"
"25829",1342,"      character, but said nothing.","Pride and prejudice"
"25830",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25831",1342,"      “From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I","Pride and prejudice"
"25832",1342,"      really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so","Pride and prejudice"
"25833",1342,"      cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not","Pride and prejudice"
"25834",1342,"      an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing","Pride and prejudice"
"25835",1342,"      about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity","Pride and prejudice"
"25836",1342,"      in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea","Pride and prejudice"
"25837",1342,"      of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his","Pride and prejudice"
"25838",1342,"      house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help","Pride and prejudice"
"25839",1342,"      laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose,","Pride and prejudice"
"25840",1342,"      and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25841",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25842",1342,"      Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in","Pride and prejudice"
"25843",1342,"      vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them","Pride and prejudice"
"25844",1342,"      to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what","Pride and prejudice"
"25845",1342,"      she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were","Pride and prejudice"
"25846",1342,"      capable of a very different construction; and that his character","Pride and prejudice"
"25847",1342,"      was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham’s so amiable, as they had","Pride and prejudice"
"25848",1342,"      been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she","Pride and prejudice"
"25849",1342,"      related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in","Pride and prejudice"
"25850",1342,"      which they had been connected, without actually naming her","Pride and prejudice"
"25851",1342,"      authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.","Pride and prejudice"
"25852",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25853",1342,"      Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now","Pride and prejudice"
"25854",1342,"      approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave","Pride and prejudice"
"25855",1342,"      way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in","Pride and prejudice"
"25856",1342,"      pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its","Pride and prejudice"
"25857",1342,"      environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by","Pride and prejudice"
"25858",1342,"      the morning’s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off","Pride and prejudice"
"25859",1342,"      again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was","Pride and prejudice"
"25860",1342,"      spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many","Pride and prejudice"
"25861",1342,"      years’ discontinuance.","Pride and prejudice"
"25862",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25863",1342,"      The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave","Pride and prejudice"
"25864",1342,"      Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she","Pride and prejudice"
"25865",1342,"      could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s","Pride and prejudice"
"25866",1342,"      civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted","Pride and prejudice"
"25867",1342,"      with his sister.","Pride and prejudice"

"25873",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25874",1342,"      Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to","Pride and prejudice"
"25875",1342,"      visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was","Pride and prejudice"
"25876",1342,"      consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole","Pride and prejudice"
"25877",1342,"      of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very","Pride and prejudice"
"25878",1342,"      morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They","Pride and prejudice"
"25879",1342,"      had been walking about the place with some of their new friends,","Pride and prejudice"
"25880",1342,"      and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining","Pride and prejudice"
"25881",1342,"      with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a","Pride and prejudice"
"25882",1342,"      window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving","Pride and prejudice"
"25883",1342,"      up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery,","Pride and prejudice"
"25884",1342,"      guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her","Pride and prejudice"
"25885",1342,"      surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour","Pride and prejudice"
"25886",1342,"      which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and","Pride and prejudice"
"25887",1342,"      the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the","Pride and prejudice"
"25888",1342,"      circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the","Pride and prejudice"
"25889",1342,"      preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing","Pride and prejudice"
"25890",1342,"      had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no","Pride and prejudice"
"25891",1342,"      other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter","Pride and prejudice"
"25892",1342,"      than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these","Pride and prejudice"
"25893",1342,"      newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation","Pride and prejudice"
"25894",1342,"      of Elizabeth’s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was","Pride and prejudice"
"25895",1342,"      quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of","Pride and prejudice"
"25896",1342,"      disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should","Pride and prejudice"
"25897",1342,"      have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious","Pride and prejudice"
"25898",1342,"      to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing","Pride and prejudice"
"25899",1342,"      would fail her.","Pride and prejudice"
"25900",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25901",1342,"      She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she","Pride and prejudice"
"25902",1342,"      walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw","Pride and prejudice"
"25903",1342,"      such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made","Pride and prejudice"
"25904",1342,"      everything worse.","Pride and prejudice"
"25905",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25906",1342,"      Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable","Pride and prejudice"
"25907",1342,"      introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that","Pride and prejudice"
"25908",1342,"      her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.","Pride and prejudice"
"25909",1342,"      Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was","Pride and prejudice"
"25910",1342,"      exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes","Pride and prejudice"
"25911",1342,"      convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it","Pride and prejudice"
"25912",1342,"      difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.","Pride and prejudice"
"25913",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25914",1342,"      Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,","Pride and prejudice"
"25915",1342,"      though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her","Pride and prejudice"
"25916",1342,"      appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her","Pride and prejudice"
"25917",1342,"      brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her","Pride and prejudice"
"25918",1342,"      manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had","Pride and prejudice"
"25919",1342,"      expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as","Pride and prejudice"
"25920",1342,"      ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such","Pride and prejudice"
"25921",1342,"      different feelings.","Pride and prejudice"
"25922",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25923",1342,"      They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that","Pride and prejudice"
"25924",1342,"      Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time","Pride and prejudice"
"25925",1342,"      to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when","Pride and prejudice"
"25926",1342,"      Bingley’s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he","Pride and prejudice"
"25927",1342,"      entered the room. All Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long","Pride and prejudice"
"25928",1342,"      done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood","Pride and prejudice"
"25929",1342,"      its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he","Pride and prejudice"
"25930",1342,"      expressed himself on seeing her again. He enquired in a friendly,","Pride and prejudice"
"25931",1342,"      though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with","Pride and prejudice"
"25932",1342,"      the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.","Pride and prejudice"
"25933",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25934",1342,"      To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting","Pride and prejudice"
"25935",1342,"      personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The","Pride and prejudice"
"25936",1342,"      whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The","Pride and prejudice"
"25937",1342,"      suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece","Pride and prejudice"
"25938",1342,"      directed their observation towards each with an earnest though","Pride and prejudice"
"25939",1342,"      guarded enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full","Pride and prejudice"
"25940",1342,"      conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of","Pride and prejudice"
"25941",1342,"      the lady’s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that","Pride and prejudice"
"25942",1342,"      the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.","Pride and prejudice"
"25943",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25944",1342,"      Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain","Pride and prejudice"
"25945",1342,"      the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her","Pride and prejudice"
"25946",1342,"      own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter","Pride and prejudice"
"25947",1342,"      object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of","Pride and prejudice"
"25948",1342,"      success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were","Pride and prejudice"
"25949",1342,"      prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was","Pride and prejudice"
"25950",1342,"      eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.","Pride and prejudice"
"25951",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25952",1342,"      In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister;","Pride and prejudice"
"25953",1342,"      and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his","Pride and prejudice"
"25954",1342,"      were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he","Pride and prejudice"
"25955",1342,"      talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased","Pride and prejudice"
"25956",1342,"      herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying","Pride and prejudice"
"25957",1342,"      to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she","Pride and prejudice"
"25958",1342,"      could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had","Pride and prejudice"
"25959",1342,"      been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side","Pride and prejudice"
"25960",1342,"      that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that","Pride and prejudice"
"25961",1342,"      could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon","Pride and prejudice"
"25962",1342,"      satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere","Pride and prejudice"
"25963",1342,"      they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a","Pride and prejudice"
"25964",1342,"      recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of","Pride and prejudice"
"25965",1342,"      saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.","Pride and prejudice"
"25966",1342,"      He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking","Pride and prejudice"
"25967",1342,"      together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that","Pride and prejudice"
"25968",1342,"      it “was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing","Pride and prejudice"
"25969",1342,"      her;” and, before she could reply, he added, “It is above eight","Pride and prejudice"
"25970",1342,"      months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were","Pride and prejudice"
"25971",1342,"      all dancing together at Netherfield.”","Pride and prejudice"
"25972",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25973",1342,"      Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he","Pride and prejudice"
"25974",1342,"      afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of","Pride and prejudice"
"25975",1342,"      the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was","Pride and prejudice"
"25976",1342,"      not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there","Pride and prejudice"
"25977",1342,"      was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.","Pride and prejudice"
"25978",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"25979",1342,"      It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy","Pride and prejudice"
"25980",1342,"      himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an","Pride and prejudice"
"25981",1342,"      expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she","Pride and prejudice"
"25982",1342,"      heard an accent so removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his","Pride and prejudice"
"25983",1342,"      companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners","Pride and prejudice"
"25984",1342,"      which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence","Pride and prejudice"
"25985",1342,"      might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus","Pride and prejudice"
"25986",1342,"      seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people","Pride and prejudice"
"25987",1342,"      with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a","Pride and prejudice"
"25988",1342,"      disgrace—when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to","Pride and prejudice"
"25989",1342,"      the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected","Pride and prejudice"
"25990",1342,"      their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage—the difference, the","Pride and prejudice"
"25991",1342,"      change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she","Pride and prejudice"
"25992",1342,"      could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never,","Pride and prejudice"
"25993",1342,"      even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his","Pride and prejudice"
"25994",1342,"      dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to","Pride and prejudice"
"25995",1342,"      please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as","Pride and prejudice"
"25996",1342,"      now, when no importance could result from the success of his","Pride and prejudice"
"25997",1342,"      endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his","Pride and prejudice"
"25998",1342,"      attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and","Pride and prejudice"
"25999",1342,"      censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.","Pride and prejudice"
"26000",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26001",1342,"      Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they","Pride and prejudice"
"26002",1342,"      arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in","Pride and prejudice"
"26003",1342,"      expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss","Pride and prejudice"
"26004",1342,"      Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.","Pride and prejudice"
"26005",1342,"      Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in","Pride and prejudice"
"26006",1342,"      the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner","Pride and prejudice"
"26007",1342,"      looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the","Pride and prejudice"
"26008",1342,"      invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance,","Pride and prejudice"
"26009",1342,"      but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however, that","Pride and prejudice"
"26010",1342,"      this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment","Pride and prejudice"
"26011",1342,"      than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who","Pride and prejudice"
"26012",1342,"      was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she","Pride and prejudice"
"26013",1342,"      ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next","Pride and prejudice"
"26014",1342,"      was fixed on.","Pride and prejudice"
"26015",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26016",1342,"      Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing","Pride and prejudice"
"26017",1342,"      Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and","Pride and prejudice"
"26018",1342,"      many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.","Pride and prejudice"
"26019",1342,"      Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak","Pride and prejudice"
"26020",1342,"      of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some","Pride and prejudice"
"26021",1342,"      others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of","Pride and prejudice"

"26023",1342,"      while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager","Pride and prejudice"
"26024",1342,"      to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and","Pride and prejudice"
"26025",1342,"      aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their","Pride and prejudice"

"26027",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26028",1342,"      But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity;","Pride and prejudice"
"26029",1342,"      it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident","Pride and prejudice"
"26030",1342,"      that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had","Pride and prejudice"
"26031",1342,"      before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love","Pride and prejudice"
"26032",1342,"      with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify","Pride and prejudice"
"26033",1342,"      enquiry.","Pride and prejudice"
"26034",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26035",1342,"      Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,","Pride and prejudice"
"26036",1342,"      as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.","Pride and prejudice"
"26037",1342,"      They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn","Pride and prejudice"
"26038",1342,"      his character from their own feelings and his servant’s report,","Pride and prejudice"
"26039",1342,"      without any reference to any other account, the circle in","Pride and prejudice"
"26040",1342,"      Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it","Pride and prejudice"
"26041",1342,"      for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing","Pride and prejudice"
"26042",1342,"      the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority","Pride and prejudice"
"26043",1342,"      of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and","Pride and prejudice"
"26044",1342,"      whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily","Pride and prejudice"
"26045",1342,"      rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of","Pride and prejudice"
"26046",1342,"      their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight.","Pride and prejudice"
"26047",1342,"      They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably","Pride and prejudice"
"26048",1342,"      had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants","Pride and prejudice"
"26049",1342,"      of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was","Pride and prejudice"
"26050",1342,"      acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much","Pride and prejudice"

"26058",1342,"      discharged.","Pride and prejudice"
"26059",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26060",1342,"      As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening","Pride and prejudice"
"26061",1342,"      more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it","Pride and prejudice"
"26062",1342,"      seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings","Pride and prejudice"
"26063",1342,"      towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours","Pride and prejudice"
"26064",1342,"      endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him.","Pride and prejudice"
"26065",1342,"      No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been","Pride and prejudice"
"26066",1342,"      ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so","Pride and prejudice"
"26067",1342,"      called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable","Pride and prejudice"
"26068",1342,"      qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some","Pride and prejudice"
"26069",1342,"      time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now","Pride and prejudice"
"26070",1342,"      heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony","Pride and prejudice"
"26071",1342,"      so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in","Pride and prejudice"
"26072",1342,"      so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all,","Pride and prejudice"
"26073",1342,"      above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of","Pride and prejudice"
"26074",1342,"      goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude;","Pride and prejudice"
"26075",1342,"      gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving","Pride and prejudice"
"26076",1342,"      her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony","Pride and prejudice"
"26077",1342,"      of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations","Pride and prejudice"
"26078",1342,"      accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would","Pride and prejudice"
"26079",1342,"      avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental","Pride and prejudice"
"26080",1342,"      meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any","Pride and prejudice"
"26081",1342,"      indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where","Pride and prejudice"
"26082",1342,"      their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good","Pride and prejudice"
"26083",1342,"      opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his","Pride and prejudice"
"26084",1342,"      sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only","Pride and prejudice"
"26085",1342,"      astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be","Pride and prejudice"
"26086",1342,"      attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be","Pride and prejudice"
"26087",1342,"      encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be","Pride and prejudice"
"26088",1342,"      exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to","Pride and prejudice"
"26089",1342,"      him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted","Pride and prejudice"
"26090",1342,"      to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself,","Pride and prejudice"
"26091",1342,"      and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should","Pride and prejudice"
"26092",1342,"      employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed,","Pride and prejudice"
"26093",1342,"      of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.","Pride and prejudice"
"26094",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26095",1342,"      It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the","Pride and prejudice"

"26097",1342,"      see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had","Pride and prejudice"
"26098",1342,"      reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though","Pride and prejudice"
"26099",1342,"      it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their","Pride and prejudice"
"26100",1342,"      side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to","Pride and prejudice"
"26101",1342,"      wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were,","Pride and prejudice"
"26102",1342,"      therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked","Pride and prejudice"
"26103",1342,"      herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.","Pride and prejudice"
"26104",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26105",1342,"      Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme","Pride and prejudice"
"26106",1342,"      had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made","Pride and prejudice"

"26114",1342,"      Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her","Pride and prejudice"
"26115",1342,"      had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how","Pride and prejudice"
"26116",1342,"      unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was","Pride and prejudice"
"26117",1342,"      curious to know with how much civility on that lady’s side the","Pride and prejudice"

"26119",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26120",1342,"      On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the","Pride and prejudice"
"26121",1342,"      saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.","Pride and prejudice"
"26122",1342,"      Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing","Pride and prejudice"

"26126",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26127",1342,"      In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting","Pride and prejudice"
"26128",1342,"      there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom","Pride and prejudice"
"26129",1342,"      she lived in London. Georgiana’s reception of them was very","Pride and prejudice"
"26130",1342,"      civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though","Pride and prejudice"
"26131",1342,"      proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily","Pride and prejudice"
"26132",1342,"      give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her","Pride and prejudice"
"26133",1342,"      being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however,","Pride and prejudice"
"26134",1342,"      did her justice, and pitied her.","Pride and prejudice"
"26135",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26136",1342,"      By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a","Pride and prejudice"
"26137",1342,"      curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such","Pride and prejudice"
"26138",1342,"      pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first","Pride and prejudice"
"26139",1342,"      broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman,","Pride and prejudice"
"26140",1342,"      whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to","Pride and prejudice"
"26141",1342,"      be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between","Pride and prejudice"
"26142",1342,"      her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the","Pride and prejudice"
"26143",1342,"      conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished","Pride and prejudice"
"26144",1342,"      for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a","Pride and prejudice"
"26145",1342,"      short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.","Pride and prejudice"
"26146",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26147",1342,"      Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss","Pride and prejudice"
"26148",1342,"      Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss","Pride and prejudice"
"26149",1342,"      Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not","Pride and prejudice"
"26150",1342,"      have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they","Pride and prejudice"
"26151",1342,"      not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not","Pride and prejudice"
"26152",1342,"      sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts","Pride and prejudice"
"26153",1342,"      were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the","Pride and prejudice"
"26154",1342,"      gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the","Pride and prejudice"
"26155",1342,"      master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished","Pride and prejudice"
"26156",1342,"      or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in","Pride and prejudice"
"26157",1342,"      this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley’s","Pride and prejudice"
"26158",1342,"      voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry","Pride and prejudice"
"26159",1342,"      after the health of her family. She answered with equal","Pride and prejudice"
"26160",1342,"      indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.","Pride and prejudice"
"26161",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26162",1342,"      The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the","Pride and prejudice"
"26163",1342,"      entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all","Pride and prejudice"
"26164",1342,"      the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till","Pride and prejudice"
"26165",1342,"      after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to","Pride and prejudice"
"26166",1342,"      Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was","Pride and prejudice"
"26167",1342,"      now employment for the whole party—for though they could not all","Pride and prejudice"
"26168",1342,"      talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes,","Pride and prejudice"
"26169",1342,"      nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.","Pride and prejudice"
"26170",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26171",1342,"      While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding","Pride and prejudice"
"26172",1342,"      whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"26173",1342,"      Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room;","Pride and prejudice"
"26174",1342,"      and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes","Pride and prejudice"
"26175",1342,"      to predominate, she began to regret that he came.","Pride and prejudice"
"26176",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26177",1342,"      He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three","Pride and prejudice"
"26178",1342,"      other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had","Pride and prejudice"
"26179",1342,"      left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended","Pride and prejudice"
"26180",1342,"      a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than","Pride and prejudice"
"26181",1342,"      Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;","Pride and prejudice"
"26182",1342,"      a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the","Pride and prejudice"
"26183",1342,"      more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the","Pride and prejudice"
"26184",1342,"      whole party were awakened against them, and that there was","Pride and prejudice"
"26185",1342,"      scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first","Pride and prejudice"
"26186",1342,"      came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so","Pride and prejudice"
"26187",1342,"      strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the smiles","Pride and prejudice"
"26188",1342,"      which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its","Pride and prejudice"
"26189",1342,"      objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her","Pride and prejudice"
"26190",1342,"      attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her","Pride and prejudice"
"26191",1342,"      brother’s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and","Pride and prejudice"
"26192",1342,"      Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to","Pride and prejudice"
"26193",1342,"      get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt","Pride and prejudice"
"26194",1342,"      at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this","Pride and prejudice"
"26195",1342,"      likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first","Pride and prejudice"
"26196",1342,"      opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:","Pride and prejudice"
"26197",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26198",1342,"      “Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire Militia removed from","Pride and prejudice"
"26199",1342,"      Meryton? They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”","Pride and prejudice"
"26200",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26201",1342,"      In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name; but","Pride and prejudice"
"26202",1342,"      Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her","Pride and prejudice"
"26203",1342,"      thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave","Pride and prejudice"
"26204",1342,"      her a moment’s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel","Pride and prejudice"
"26205",1342,"      the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a","Pride and prejudice"
"26206",1342,"      tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance","Pride and prejudice"
"26207",1342,"      showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking","Pride and prejudice"
"26208",1342,"      at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to","Pride and prejudice"
"26209",1342,"      lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then","Pride and prejudice"
"26210",1342,"      giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained","Pride and prejudice"
"26211",1342,"      from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose","Pride and prejudice"
"26212",1342,"      Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she","Pride and prejudice"
"26213",1342,"      believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which","Pride and prejudice"
"26214",1342,"      might injure her in Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the","Pride and prejudice"
"26215",1342,"      latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of","Pride and prejudice"
"26216",1342,"      her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had","Pride and prejudice"
"26217",1342,"      ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s meditated elopement. To no","Pride and prejudice"
"26218",1342,"      creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except","Pride and prejudice"
"26219",1342,"      to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections her brother was","Pride and prejudice"
"26220",1342,"      particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which","Pride and prejudice"
"26221",1342,"      Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming","Pride and prejudice"
"26222",1342,"      hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and","Pride and prejudice"
"26223",1342,"      without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate","Pride and prejudice"
"26224",1342,"      him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something","Pride and prejudice"
"26225",1342,"      to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.","Pride and prejudice"
"26226",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26227",1342,"      Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his","Pride and prejudice"
"26228",1342,"      emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not","Pride and prejudice"
"26229",1342,"      approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time,","Pride and prejudice"
"26230",1342,"      though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother,","Pride and prejudice"
"26231",1342,"      whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest","Pride and prejudice"
"26232",1342,"      in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed","Pride and prejudice"
"26233",1342,"      to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on","Pride and prejudice"
"26234",1342,"      her more and more cheerfully.","Pride and prejudice"
"26235",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26236",1342,"      Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer","Pride and prejudice"
"26237",1342,"      above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their","Pride and prejudice"
"26238",1342,"      carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on","Pride and prejudice"
"26239",1342,"      Elizabeth’s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not","Pride and prejudice"
"26240",1342,"      join her. Her brother’s recommendation was enough to ensure her","Pride and prejudice"
"26241",1342,"      favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such","Pride and prejudice"
"26242",1342,"      terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of","Pride and prejudice"
"26243",1342,"      finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy","Pride and prejudice"
"26244",1342,"      returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to","Pride and prejudice"
"26245",1342,"      him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.","Pride and prejudice"
"26246",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26247",1342,"      “How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,”","Pride and prejudice"
"26248",1342,"      she cried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she","Pride and prejudice"
"26249",1342,"      is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and","Pride and prejudice"
"26250",1342,"      I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.”","Pride and prejudice"
"26251",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26252",1342,"      However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he","Pride and prejudice"
"26253",1342,"      contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other","Pride and prejudice"
"26254",1342,"      alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous","Pride and prejudice"
"26255",1342,"      consequence of travelling in the summer.","Pride and prejudice"

"26262",1342,"      her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never","Pride and prejudice"
"26263",1342,"      see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish","Pride and prejudice"

"26269",1342,"      are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat","Pride and prejudice"
"26270",1342,"      nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely","Pride and prejudice"
"26271",1342,"      silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak,","Pride and prejudice"
"26272",1342,"      she continued:","Pride and prejudice"

"26276",1342,"      particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been","Pride and prejudice"
"26277",1342,"      dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_ a beauty!—I should as soon call her","Pride and prejudice"
"26278",1342,"      mother a wit.’ But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I","Pride and prejudice"

"26292",1342,"      particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of","Pride and prejudice"
"26293",1342,"      everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who","Pride and prejudice"

"26326",1342,"      relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just","Pride and prejudice"

"26333",1342,"      Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this","Pride and prejudice"
"26334",1342,"      step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His","Pride and prejudice"
"26335",1342,"      choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can","Pride and prejudice"
"26336",1342,"      give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father","Pride and prejudice"
"26337",1342,"      bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let them know","Pride and prejudice"
"26338",1342,"      what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They","Pride and prejudice"
"26339",1342,"      were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were","Pride and prejudice"
"26340",1342,"      not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent","Pride and prejudice"

"26361",1342,"      for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to","Pride and prejudice"
"26362",1342,"      Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton","Pride and prejudice"
"26363",1342,"      the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s","Pride and prejudice"
"26364",1342,"      short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were","Pride and prejudice"
"26365",1342,"      going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing","Pride and prejudice"
"26366",1342,"      his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia","Pride and prejudice"
"26367",1342,"      at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking","Pride and prejudice"
"26368",1342,"      the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did","Pride and prejudice"
"26369",1342,"      trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering","Pride and prejudice"
"26370",1342,"      that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the","Pride and prejudice"
"26371",1342,"      chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this","Pride and prejudice"
"26372",1342,"      is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not","Pride and prejudice"
"26373",1342,"      what to think. After making every possible enquiry on that side","Pride and prejudice"
"26374",1342,"      London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing","Pride and prejudice"
"26375",1342,"      them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and","Pride and prejudice"
"26376",1342,"      Hatfield, but without any success—no such people had been seen to","Pride and prejudice"
"26377",1342,"      pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn,","Pride and prejudice"
"26378",1342,"      and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to","Pride and prejudice"
"26379",1342,"      his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one","Pride and prejudice"
"26380",1342,"      can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very","Pride and prejudice"
"26381",1342,"      great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think","Pride and prejudice"
"26382",1342,"      so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for","Pride and prejudice"
"26383",1342,"      them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first","Pride and prejudice"
"26384",1342,"      plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young","Pride and prejudice"
"26385",1342,"      woman of Lydia’s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose","Pride and prejudice"
"26386",1342,"      her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however,","Pride and prejudice"
"26387",1342,"      that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he","Pride and prejudice"
"26388",1342,"      shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W.","Pride and prejudice"
"26389",1342,"      was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and","Pride and prejudice"
"26390",1342,"      keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but","Pride and prejudice"
"26391",1342,"      this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my","Pride and prejudice"
"26392",1342,"      life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having","Pride and prejudice"
"26393",1342,"      concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence,","Pride and prejudice"
"26394",1342,"      one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have","Pride and prejudice"
"26395",1342,"      been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as","Pride and prejudice"
"26396",1342,"      the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?","Pride and prejudice"
"26397",1342,"      I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if","Pride and prejudice"
"26398",1342,"      inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have","Pride and prejudice"
"26399",1342,"      just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I","Pride and prejudice"
"26400",1342,"      cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as","Pride and prejudice"
"26401",1342,"      possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not","Pride and prejudice"
"26402",1342,"      afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to","Pride and prejudice"
"26403",1342,"      ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel","Pride and prejudice"
"26404",1342,"      Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I","Pride and prejudice"
"26405",1342,"      am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him","Pride and prejudice"
"26406",1342,"      to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel","Pride and prejudice"
"26407",1342,"      Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In","Pride and prejudice"
"26408",1342,"      such an exigence, my uncle’s advice and assistance would be","Pride and prejudice"
"26409",1342,"      everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I","Pride and prejudice"

"26414",1342,"      without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she","Pride and prejudice"
"26415",1342,"      reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy","Pride and prejudice"
"26416",1342,"      appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and","Pride and prejudice"
"26417",1342,"      before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind","Pride and prejudice"
"26418",1342,"      every idea was superseded by Lydia’s situation, hastily","Pride and prejudice"
"26419",1342,"      exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find","Pride and prejudice"
"26420",1342,"      Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I","Pride and prejudice"
"26421",1342,"      have not an instant to lose.”","Pride and prejudice"
"26422",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26423",1342,"      “Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than","Pride and prejudice"

"26425",1342,"      minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs.","Pride and prejudice"
"26426",1342,"      Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”","Pride and prejudice"
"26427",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26428",1342,"      Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she","Pride and prejudice"
"26429",1342,"      felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.","Pride and prejudice"
"26430",1342,"      Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though","Pride and prejudice"
"26431",1342,"      in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to","Pride and prejudice"
"26432",1342,"      fetch his master and mistress home instantly.","Pride and prejudice"
"26433",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26434",1342,"      On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself,","Pride and prejudice"
"26435",1342,"      and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to","Pride and prejudice"
"26436",1342,"      leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and","Pride and prejudice"
"26437",1342,"      commiseration, “Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could","Pride and prejudice"
"26438",1342,"      take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you","Pride and prejudice"
"26439",1342,"      one? You are very ill.”","Pride and prejudice"
"26440",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26441",1342,"      “No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.","Pride and prejudice"
"26442",1342,"      “There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only","Pride and prejudice"
"26443",1342,"      distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from","Pride and prejudice"
"26444",1342,"      Longbourn.”","Pride and prejudice"
"26445",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26446",1342,"      She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes","Pride and prejudice"
"26447",1342,"      could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could","Pride and prejudice"
"26448",1342,"      only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her","Pride and prejudice"
"26449",1342,"      in compassionate silence. At length she spoke again. “I have just","Pride and prejudice"
"26450",1342,"      had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be","Pride and prejudice"
"26451",1342,"      concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her","Pride and prejudice"
"26452",1342,"      friends—has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"26453",1342,"      Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him","Pride and prejudice"
"26454",1342,"      too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections,","Pride and prejudice"
"26455",1342,"      nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for ever.”","Pride and prejudice"
"26456",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26457",1342,"      Darcy was fixed in astonishment. “When I consider,” she added in","Pride and prejudice"
"26458",1342,"      a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_ might have prevented it! _I_","Pride and prejudice"
"26459",1342,"      who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it","Pride and prejudice"
"26460",1342,"      only—some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his","Pride and prejudice"
"26461",1342,"      character been known, this could not have happened. But it is","Pride and prejudice"

"26463",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26464",1342,"      “I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved—shocked. But is it","Pride and prejudice"

"26466",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26467",1342,"      “Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were","Pride and prejudice"

"26474",1342,"      “My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my","Pride and prejudice"

"26476",1342,"      half-an-hour. But nothing can be done—I know very well that","Pride and prejudice"
"26477",1342,"      nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are","Pride and prejudice"
"26478",1342,"      they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is","Pride and prejudice"

"26486",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26487",1342,"      Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was","Pride and prejudice"
"26488",1342,"      walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow","Pride and prejudice"

"26501",1342,"      soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with","Pride and prejudice"
"26502",1342,"      her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else;","Pride and prejudice"
"26503",1342,"      and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a","Pride and prejudice"
"26504",1342,"      sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a","Pride and prejudice"
"26505",1342,"      manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise","Pride and prejudice"
"26506",1342,"      restraint, said, “I am afraid you have been long desiring my","Pride and prejudice"
"26507",1342,"      absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but","Pride and prejudice"
"26508",1342,"      real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything","Pride and prejudice"
"26509",1342,"      could be either said or done on my part that might offer","Pride and prejudice"
"26510",1342,"      consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with","Pride and prejudice"
"26511",1342,"      vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.","Pride and prejudice"
"26512",1342,"      This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having","Pride and prejudice"

"26537",1342,"      unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often","Pride and prejudice"
"26538",1342,"      described as arising on a first interview with its object, and","Pride and prejudice"
"26539",1342,"      even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in","Pride and prejudice"
"26540",1342,"      her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the","Pride and prejudice"

"26542",1342,"      success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less","Pride and prejudice"
"26543",1342,"      interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go","Pride and prejudice"
"26544",1342,"      with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy","Pride and prejudice"
"26545",1342,"      must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that","Pride and prejudice"
"26546",1342,"      wretched business. Never, since reading Jane’s second letter, had","Pride and prejudice"
"26547",1342,"      she entertained a hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one","Pride and prejudice"
"26548",1342,"      but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an","Pride and prejudice"
"26549",1342,"      expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this","Pride and prejudice"
"26550",1342,"      development. While the contents of the first letter remained in","Pride and prejudice"
"26551",1342,"      her mind, she was all surprise—all astonishment that Wickham","Pride and prejudice"
"26552",1342,"      should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for","Pride and prejudice"
"26553",1342,"      money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared","Pride and prejudice"
"26554",1342,"      incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an","Pride and prejudice"
"26555",1342,"      attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though","Pride and prejudice"
"26556",1342,"      she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an","Pride and prejudice"

"26558",1342,"      difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her","Pride and prejudice"

"26560",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26561",1342,"      She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire,","Pride and prejudice"
"26562",1342,"      that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that","Pride and prejudice"
"26563",1342,"      Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody.","Pride and prejudice"
"26564",1342,"      Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite,","Pride and prejudice"
"26565",1342,"      as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections","Pride and prejudice"
"26566",1342,"      had continually been fluctuating but never without an object. The","Pride and prejudice"
"26567",1342,"      mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a","Pride and prejudice"
"26568",1342,"      girl—oh! how acutely did she now feel it!","Pride and prejudice"
"26569",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26570",1342,"      She was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot","Pride and prejudice"
"26571",1342,"      to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon","Pride and prejudice"
"26572",1342,"      her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable","Pride and prejudice"
"26573",1342,"      of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost","Pride and prejudice"
"26574",1342,"      persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s","Pride and prejudice"
"26575",1342,"      interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered","Pride and prejudice"
"26576",1342,"      the room her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had","Pride and prejudice"
"26577",1342,"      hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant’s account that","Pride and prejudice"
"26578",1342,"      their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly","Pride and prejudice"
"26579",1342,"      on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their","Pride and prejudice"
"26580",1342,"      summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the","Pride and prejudice"
"26581",1342,"      postscript of the last with trembling energy.— Though Lydia had","Pride and prejudice"
"26582",1342,"      never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not","Pride and prejudice"
"26583",1342,"      but be deeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned","Pride and prejudice"
"26584",1342,"      in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror,","Pride and prejudice"
"26585",1342,"      Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth,","Pride and prejudice"
"26586",1342,"      though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude;","Pride and prejudice"
"26587",1342,"      and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating","Pride and prejudice"
"26588",1342,"      to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as","Pride and prejudice"
"26589",1342,"      soon as possible. “But what is to be done about Pemberley?” cried","Pride and prejudice"
"26590",1342,"      Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for","Pride and prejudice"

"26592",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26593",1342,"      “Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our","Pride and prejudice"

"26595",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26596",1342,"      “That is all settled;” repeated the other, as she ran into her","Pride and prejudice"

"26599",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"

"26601",1342,"      in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth","Pride and prejudice"
"26602",1342,"      been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that","Pride and prejudice"
"26603",1342,"      all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but","Pride and prejudice"
"26604",1342,"      she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst","Pride and prejudice"
"26605",1342,"      the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at","Pride and prejudice"
"26606",1342,"      Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour,","Pride and prejudice"
"26607",1342,"      however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile","Pride and prejudice"
"26608",1342,"      having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be","Pride and prejudice"

"26874",1342,"      I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not","Pride and prejudice"
"26875",1342,"      to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,","Pride and prejudice"
"26876",1342,"      for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother,","Pride and prejudice"

"26896",1342,"      their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other","Pride and prejudice"
"26897",1342,"      from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably","Pride and prejudice"
"26898",1342,"      calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss","Pride and prejudice"
"26899",1342,"      of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself","Pride and prejudice"
"26900",1342,"      incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than","Pride and prejudice"
"26901",1342,"      usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress","Pride and prejudice"
"26902",1342,"      enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of","Pride and prejudice"
"26903",1342,"      grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:","Pride and prejudice"

"26905",1342,"      “This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much","Pride and prejudice"
"26906",1342,"      talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the","Pride and prejudice"

"26908",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26909",1342,"      Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she","Pride and prejudice"

"26912",1342,"      irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin;","Pride and prejudice"
"26913",1342,"      that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and","Pride and prejudice"

"26916",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"26917",1342,"      Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much","Pride and prejudice"
"26918",1342,"      oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console","Pride and prejudice"
"26919",1342,"      herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before","Pride and prejudice"

"26924",1342,"      herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane","Pride and prejudice"
"26925",1342,"      was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general","Pride and prejudice"

"26931",1342,"      did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything","Pride and prejudice"

"27177",1342,"      now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a","Pride and prejudice"

"27184",1342,"      circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a","Pride and prejudice"

"27187",1342,"      lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte","Pride and prejudice"
"27188",1342,"      informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your","Pride and prejudice"

"27190",1342,"      though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and","Pride and prejudice"
"27191",1342,"      Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must","Pride and prejudice"
"27192",1342,"      be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity,","Pride and prejudice"
"27193",1342,"      at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to","Pride and prejudice"

"27195",1342,"      but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have","Pride and prejudice"
"27196",1342,"      related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this","Pride and prejudice"

"27198",1342,"      all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself","Pride and prejudice"

"27210",1342,"      Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer","Pride and prejudice"
"27211",1342,"      from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant","Pride and prejudice"

"27216",1342,"      not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any","Pride and prejudice"

"27221",1342,"      had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a","Pride and prejudice"

"27223",1342,"      a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at","Pride and prejudice"
"27224",1342,"      Brighton. He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour","Pride and prejudice"
"27225",1342,"      were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to","Pride and prejudice"
"27226",1342,"      conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard","Pride and prejudice"

"27483",1342,"      continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then","Pride and prejudice"
"27484",1342,"      went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the","Pride and prejudice"

"27496",1342,"      him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like","Pride and prejudice"
"27497",1342,"      it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have","Pride and prejudice"

"27504",1342,"      of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her","Pride and prejudice"
"27505",1342,"      home, and affording her their personal protection and","Pride and prejudice"
"27506",1342,"      countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of","Pride and prejudice"

"27526",1342,"      the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would","Pride and prejudice"
"27527",1342,"      not wish them to make it known to her. He was writing and,","Pride and prejudice"
"27528",1342,"      without raising his head, coolly replied:","Pride and prejudice"

"27538",1342,"      one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight","Pride and prejudice"
"27539",1342,"      preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet","Pride and prejudice"
"27540",1342,"      could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"27541",1342,"      Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married, her joy burst","Pride and prejudice"
"27542",1342,"      forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She","Pride and prejudice"
"27543",1342,"      was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever","Pride and prejudice"
"27544",1342,"      been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter","Pride and prejudice"
"27545",1342,"      would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her","Pride and prejudice"
"27546",1342,"      felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.","Pride and prejudice"
"27547",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"27548",1342,"      “My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried. “This is delightful indeed! She","Pride and prejudice"

"27550",1342,"      sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he","Pride and prejudice"

"27552",1342,"      Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write","Pride and prejudice"
"27553",1342,"      to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run","Pride and prejudice"
"27554",1342,"      down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay,","Pride and prejudice"
"27555",1342,"      stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will","Pride and prejudice"
"27556",1342,"      put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we","Pride and prejudice"

"27563",1342,"      “For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a","Pride and prejudice"

"27566",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"27567",1342,"      “Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it","Pride and prejudice"
"27568",1342,"      but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and","Pride and prejudice"
"27569",1342,"      my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the","Pride and prejudice"
"27570",1342,"      first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few","Pride and prejudice"
"27571",1342,"      presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a","Pride and prejudice"
"27572",1342,"      daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was","Pride and prejudice"
"27573",1342,"      only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter,","Pride and prejudice"
"27574",1342,"      that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you write","Pride and prejudice"
"27575",1342,"      for me. We will settle with your father about the money","Pride and prejudice"

"27577",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"27578",1342,"      She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,","Pride and prejudice"
"27579",1342,"      and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful","Pride and prejudice"

"27581",1342,"      to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s","Pride and prejudice"
"27582",1342,"      delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother","Pride and prejudice"
"27583",1342,"      was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes,","Pride and prejudice"
"27584",1342,"      too, came into her head.","Pride and prejudice"
"27585",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"27586",1342,"      “I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and","Pride and prejudice"

"27588",1342,"      back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and","Pride and prejudice"
"27589",1342,"      order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I","Pride and prejudice"

"27591",1342,"      comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss","Pride and prejudice"
"27592",1342,"      Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of","Pride and prejudice"

"27594",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"27595",1342,"      Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received","Pride and prejudice"
"27596",1342,"      her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this","Pride and prejudice"
"27597",1342,"      folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with","Pride and prejudice"

"27599",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"27600",1342,"      Poor Lydia’s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it","Pride and prejudice"

"27614",1342,"      annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his","Pride and prejudice"

"27617",1342,"      indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now","Pride and prejudice"

"27623",1342,"      anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his","Pride and prejudice"
"27624",1342,"      brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out","Pride and prejudice"

"27628",1342,"      When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be","Pride and prejudice"

"27630",1342,"      son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should","Pride and prejudice"
"27631",1342,"      be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means","Pride and prejudice"

"27635",1342,"      had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be","Pride and prejudice"

"27643",1342,"      This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now","Pride and prejudice"
"27644",1342,"      to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in","Pride and prejudice"

"27648",1342,"      approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil","Pride and prejudice"

"27670",1342,"      the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been","Pride and prejudice"
"27671",1342,"      more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come","Pride and prejudice"
"27672",1342,"      upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded","Pride and prejudice"
"27673",1342,"      from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to","Pride and prejudice"

"27704",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"27705",1342,"      A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was","Pride and prejudice"

"27707",1342,"      amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea","Pride and prejudice"
"27708",1342,"      to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should","Pride and prejudice"

"27710",1342,"      Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be","Pride and prejudice"

"27728",1342,"      depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge","Pride and prejudice"
"27729",1342,"      of a sister’s frailty would have mortified her so much—not,","Pride and prejudice"
"27730",1342,"      however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to","Pride and prejudice"
"27731",1342,"      herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between","Pride and prejudice"

"27743",1342,"      of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by","Pride and prejudice"
"27744",1342,"      it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance","Pride and prejudice"

"27755",1342,"      She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in","Pride and prejudice"

"27757",1342,"      and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her","Pride and prejudice"
"27758",1342,"      wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of","Pride and prejudice"

"27760",1342,"      softened, his manners improved; and from his judgement,","Pride and prejudice"
"27761",1342,"      information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received","Pride and prejudice"

"27778",1342,"      concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be","Pride and prejudice"
"27779",1342,"      mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was","Pride and prejudice"
"27780",1342,"      to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the","Pride and prejudice"

"27783",1342,"      “It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon","Pride and prejudice"
"27784",1342,"      as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me,","Pride and prejudice"
"27785",1342,"      in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable,","Pride and prejudice"
"27786",1342,"      both on his account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention","Pride and prejudice"
"27787",1342,"      to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are","Pride and prejudice"
"27788",1342,"      still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He","Pride and prejudice"
"27789",1342,"      has the promise of an ensigncy in General ——’s regiment, now","Pride and prejudice"
"27790",1342,"      quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from","Pride and prejudice"
"27791",1342,"      this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among","Pride and prejudice"
"27792",1342,"      different people, where they may each have a character to","Pride and prejudice"
"27793",1342,"      preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to","Pride and prejudice"
"27794",1342,"      Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and","Pride and prejudice"
"27795",1342,"      to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"27796",1342,"      Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment,","Pride and prejudice"
"27797",1342,"      for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the","Pride and prejudice"

"27799",1342,"      Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his","Pride and prejudice"
"27800",1342,"      information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he","Pride and prejudice"
"27801",1342,"      has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will","Pride and prejudice"
"27802",1342,"      be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless","Pride and prejudice"
"27803",1342,"      they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.","Pride and prejudice"

"27812",1342,"      Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being","Pride and prejudice"
"27813",1342,"      settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure","Pride and prejudice"
"27814",1342,"      and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her","Pride and prejudice"
"27815",1342,"      plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe","Pride and prejudice"
"27816",1342,"      disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia","Pride and prejudice"

"27826",1342,"      admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,","Pride and prejudice"
"27827",1342,"      received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,","Pride and prejudice"
"27828",1342,"      who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings","Pride and prejudice"
"27829",1342,"      and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by","Pride and prejudice"
"27830",1342,"      her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so","Pride and prejudice"
"27831",1342,"      mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as","Pride and prejudice"
"27832",1342,"      they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they","Pride and prejudice"
"27833",1342,"      thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the","Pride and prejudice"
"27834",1342,"      satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her","Pride and prejudice"
"27835",1342,"      married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to","Pride and prejudice"
"27836",1342,"      the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore,","Pride and prejudice"
"27837",1342,"      he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that","Pride and prejudice"
"27838",1342,"      as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to","Pride and prejudice"
"27839",1342,"      Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should","Pride and prejudice"
"27840",1342,"      consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own","Pride and prejudice"

"27850",1342,"      for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was","Pride and prejudice"
"27851",1342,"      sent to meet them at ——, and they were to return in it by","Pride and prejudice"
"27852",1342,"      dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets,","Pride and prejudice"
"27853",1342,"      and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would","Pride and prejudice"

"27856",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"27857",1342,"      They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to","Pride and prejudice"

"27859",1342,"      carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably","Pride and prejudice"

"27861",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"27862",1342,"      Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown","Pride and prejudice"
"27863",1342,"      open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards,","Pride and prejudice"
"27864",1342,"      embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with","Pride and prejudice"
"27865",1342,"      an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and","Pride and prejudice"

"27868",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"27869",1342,"      Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was","Pride and prejudice"
"27870",1342,"      not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity;","Pride and prejudice"
"27871",1342,"      and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young","Pride and prejudice"
"27872",1342,"      couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was","Pride and prejudice"
"27873",1342,"      disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia","Pride and prejudice"
"27874",1342,"      still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned","Pride and prejudice"
"27875",1342,"      from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when","Pride and prejudice"
"27876",1342,"      at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took","Pride and prejudice"
"27877",1342,"      notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a","Pride and prejudice"

"27883",1342,"      address, while he claimed their relationship, would have","Pride and prejudice"
"27884",1342,"      delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite","Pride and prejudice"
"27885",1342,"      equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within","Pride and prejudice"
"27886",1342,"      herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an","Pride and prejudice"

"27894",1342,"      that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very","Pride and prejudice"
"27895",1342,"      unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have","Pride and prejudice"
"27896",1342,"      the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was","Pride and prejudice"
"27897",1342,"      recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects","Pride and prejudice"

"27913",1342,"      my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the","Pride and prejudice"

"27915",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"27916",1342,"      Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the","Pride and prejudice"
"27917",1342,"      room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through","Pride and prejudice"
"27918",1342,"      the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough","Pride and prejudice"
"27919",1342,"      to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right","Pride and prejudice"

"27991",1342,"      “No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too","Pride and prejudice"

"27994",1342,"      “La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We","Pride and prejudice"

"27996",1342,"      lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should","Pride and prejudice"
"27997",1342,"      all be there by eleven o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to","Pride and prejudice"
"27998",1342,"      go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well,","Pride and prejudice"
"27999",1342,"      Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,","Pride and prejudice"
"28000",1342,"      you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I","Pride and prejudice"
"28001",1342,"      should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the","Pride and prejudice"
"28002",1342,"      time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she","Pride and prejudice"
"28003",1342,"      was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in","Pride and prejudice"
"28004",1342,"      ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I","Pride and prejudice"

"28009",1342,"      uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with","Pride and prejudice"

"28011",1342,"      doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme,","Pride and prejudice"
"28012",1342,"      or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the","Pride and prejudice"
"28013",1342,"      Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came","Pride and prejudice"
"28014",1342,"      to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that","Pride and prejudice"

"28018",1342,"      were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But,","Pride and prejudice"
"28019",1342,"      luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all","Pride and prejudice"
"28020",1342,"      set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he _had_ been","Pride and prejudice"
"28021",1342,"      prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy","Pride and prejudice"

"28039",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28040",1342,"      On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out","Pride and prejudice"

"28109",1342,"      collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and","Pride and prejudice"
"28110",1342,"      came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive","Pride and prejudice"
"28111",1342,"      professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that","Pride and prejudice"

"28115",1342,"      confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his","Pride and prejudice"
"28116",1342,"      private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for","Pride and prejudice"

"28143",1342,"      offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found","Pride and prejudice"
"28144",1342,"      Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared","Pride and prejudice"
"28145",1342,"      for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not","Pride and prejudice"
"28146",1342,"      hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some","Pride and prejudice"
"28147",1342,"      time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were","Pride and prejudice"
"28148",1342,"      her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and","Pride and prejudice"

"28155",1342,"      as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about","Pride and prejudice"

"28649",1342,"      irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful","Pride and prejudice"
"28650",1342,"      degree by a distinction so ill applied.","Pride and prejudice"
"28651",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28652",1342,"      Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a","Pride and prejudice"
"28653",1342,"      question which she could not answer without confusion, said","Pride and prejudice"
"28654",1342,"      scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the","Pride and prejudice"
"28655",1342,"      reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.","Pride and prejudice"
"28656",1342,"      There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.","Pride and prejudice"
"28657",1342,"      But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his","Pride and prejudice"
"28658",1342,"      voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of","Pride and prejudice"
"28659",1342,"      curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found","Pride and prejudice"
"28660",1342,"      him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object","Pride and prejudice"
"28661",1342,"      but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please,","Pride and prejudice"
"28662",1342,"      than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was","Pride and prejudice"
"28663",1342,"      disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.","Pride and prejudice"
"28664",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28665",1342,"      “Could I expect it to be otherwise!” said she. “Yet why did he","Pride and prejudice"
"28666",1342,"      come?”","Pride and prejudice"
"28667",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28668",1342,"      She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself;","Pride and prejudice"
"28669",1342,"      and to him she had hardly courage to speak.","Pride and prejudice"
"28670",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28671",1342,"      She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.","Pride and prejudice"
"28672",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28673",1342,"      “It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs.","Pride and prejudice"
"28674",1342,"      Bennet.","Pride and prejudice"
"28675",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28676",1342,"      He readily agreed to it.","Pride and prejudice"
"28677",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28678",1342,"      “I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People","Pride and prejudice"
"28679",1342,"      _did_ say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas;","Pride and prejudice"
"28680",1342,"      but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have","Pride and prejudice"
"28681",1342,"      happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is","Pride and prejudice"
"28682",1342,"      married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you","Pride and prejudice"
"28683",1342,"      have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It","Pride and prejudice"
"28684",1342,"      was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put","Pride and prejudice"
"28685",1342,"      in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately, George Wickham,","Pride and prejudice"
"28686",1342,"      Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a syllable said","Pride and prejudice"
"28687",1342,"      of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was","Pride and prejudice"
"28688",1342,"      my brother Gardiner’s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to","Pride and prejudice"

"28690",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28691",1342,"      Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.","Pride and prejudice"
"28692",1342,"      Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked,","Pride and prejudice"
"28693",1342,"      therefore, she could not tell.","Pride and prejudice"
"28694",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28695",1342,"      “It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well","Pride and prejudice"
"28696",1342,"      married,” continued her mother, “but at the same time, Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"28697",1342,"      Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.","Pride and prejudice"
"28698",1342,"      They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it","Pride and prejudice"
"28699",1342,"      seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His","Pride and prejudice"
"28700",1342,"      regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving","Pride and prejudice"
"28701",1342,"      the ——shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank","Pride and prejudice"

"28704",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28705",1342,"      Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such","Pride and prejudice"
"28706",1342,"      misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew","Pride and prejudice"
"28707",1342,"      from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else","Pride and prejudice"
"28708",1342,"      had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he","Pride and prejudice"
"28709",1342,"      meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he","Pride and prejudice"
"28710",1342,"      believed.","Pride and prejudice"
"28711",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28712",1342,"      “When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her","Pride and prejudice"
"28713",1342,"      mother, “I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you","Pride and prejudice"
"28714",1342,"      please on Mr. Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy","Pride and prejudice"
"28715",1342,"      to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.”","Pride and prejudice"
"28716",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28717",1342,"      Elizabeth’s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious","Pride and prejudice"
"28718",1342,"      attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had","Pride and prejudice"
"28719",1342,"      flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would","Pride and prejudice"
"28720",1342,"      be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant,","Pride and prejudice"
"28721",1342,"      she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself","Pride and prejudice"
"28722",1342,"      amends for moments of such painful confusion.","Pride and prejudice"
"28723",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28724",1342,"      “The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more","Pride and prejudice"
"28725",1342,"      to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no","Pride and prejudice"
"28726",1342,"      pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me","Pride and prejudice"
"28727",1342,"      never see either one or the other again!”","Pride and prejudice"
"28728",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28729",1342,"      Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no","Pride and prejudice"
"28730",1342,"      compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from","Pride and prejudice"
"28731",1342,"      observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the","Pride and prejudice"
"28732",1342,"      admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had","Pride and prejudice"
"28733",1342,"      spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be","Pride and prejudice"
"28734",1342,"      giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she","Pride and prejudice"
"28735",1342,"      had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though","Pride and prejudice"
"28736",1342,"      not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should","Pride and prejudice"
"28737",1342,"      be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she","Pride and prejudice"
"28738",1342,"      talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that","Pride and prejudice"
"28739",1342,"      she did not always know when she was silent.","Pride and prejudice"
"28740",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28741",1342,"      When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of","Pride and prejudice"
"28742",1342,"      her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine","Pride and prejudice"
"28743",1342,"      at Longbourn in a few days time.","Pride and prejudice"
"28744",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28745",1342,"      “You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for","Pride and prejudice"
"28746",1342,"      when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family","Pride and prejudice"
"28747",1342,"      dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you","Pride and prejudice"
"28748",1342,"      see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did","Pride and prejudice"
"28749",1342,"      not come back and keep your engagement.”","Pride and prejudice"
"28750",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28751",1342,"      Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said","Pride and prejudice"
"28752",1342,"      something of his concern at having been prevented by business.","Pride and prejudice"
"28753",1342,"      They then went away.","Pride and prejudice"
"28754",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28755",1342,"      Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and","Pride and prejudice"

"28757",1342,"      table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be","Pride and prejudice"
"28758",1342,"      good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or","Pride and prejudice"
"28759",1342,"      satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a","Pride and prejudice"

"28768",1342,"      spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on","Pride and prejudice"
"28769",1342,"      those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour","Pride and prejudice"
"28770",1342,"      astonished and vexed her.","Pride and prejudice"
"28771",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28772",1342,"      “Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said","Pride and prejudice"

"28774",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"

"28781",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28782",1342,"      Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the","Pride and prejudice"
"28783",1342,"      approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look,","Pride and prejudice"

"28786",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28787",1342,"      “Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel","Pride and prejudice"
"28788",1342,"      perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be","Pride and prejudice"
"28789",1342,"      embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on","Pride and prejudice"
"28790",1342,"      Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we","Pride and prejudice"

"28803",1342,"      Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy","Pride and prejudice"
"28804",1342,"      schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley,","Pride and prejudice"
"28805",1342,"      in half an hour’s visit, had revived.","Pride and prejudice"
"28806",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28807",1342,"      On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and","Pride and prejudice"
"28808",1342,"      the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their","Pride and prejudice"
"28809",1342,"      punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they","Pride and prejudice"
"28810",1342,"      repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see","Pride and prejudice"

"28812",1342,"      parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother,","Pride and prejudice"
"28813",1342,"      occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by","Pride and prejudice"
"28814",1342,"      herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane","Pride and prejudice"
"28815",1342,"      happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He","Pride and prejudice"
"28816",1342,"      placed himself by her.","Pride and prejudice"
"28817",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28818",1342,"      Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his","Pride and prejudice"
"28819",1342,"      friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have","Pride and prejudice"
"28820",1342,"      imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had","Pride and prejudice"
"28821",1342,"      she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an","Pride and prejudice"
"28822",1342,"      expression of half-laughing alarm.","Pride and prejudice"
"28823",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28824",1342,"      His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as","Pride and prejudice"
"28825",1342,"      showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than","Pride and prejudice"
"28826",1342,"      formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself,","Pride and prejudice"
"28827",1342,"      Jane’s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though","Pride and prejudice"
"28828",1342,"      she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received","Pride and prejudice"
"28829",1342,"      pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the","Pride and prejudice"
"28830",1342,"      animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no","Pride and prejudice"
"28831",1342,"      cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the","Pride and prejudice"
"28832",1342,"      table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She","Pride and prejudice"
"28833",1342,"      knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either,","Pride and prejudice"
"28834",1342,"      or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to","Pride and prejudice"
"28835",1342,"      hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they","Pride and prejudice"
"28836",1342,"      spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner","Pride and prejudice"
"28837",1342,"      whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness, made the sense of","Pride and prejudice"
"28838",1342,"      what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind; and she","Pride and prejudice"
"28839",1342,"      would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him","Pride and prejudice"
"28840",1342,"      that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of","Pride and prejudice"
"28841",1342,"      the family.","Pride and prejudice"
"28842",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28843",1342,"      She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity","Pride and prejudice"
"28844",1342,"      of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not","Pride and prejudice"
"28845",1342,"      pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of","Pride and prejudice"
"28846",1342,"      conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his","Pride and prejudice"
"28847",1342,"      entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the","Pride and prejudice"
"28848",1342,"      drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull","Pride and prejudice"
"28849",1342,"      to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to","Pride and prejudice"
"28850",1342,"      their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure","Pride and prejudice"
"28851",1342,"      for the evening must depend.","Pride and prejudice"
"28852",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28853",1342,"      “If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him","Pride and prejudice"

"28856",1342,"      The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have","Pride and prejudice"
"28857",1342,"      answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the","Pride and prejudice"
"28858",1342,"      table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring","Pride and prejudice"
"28859",1342,"      out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a","Pride and prejudice"
"28860",1342,"      single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the","Pride and prejudice"
"28861",1342,"      gentlemen’s approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her","Pride and prejudice"
"28862",1342,"      than ever, and said, in a whisper:","Pride and prejudice"
"28863",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28864",1342,"      “The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none","Pride and prejudice"
"28865",1342,"      of them; do we?”","Pride and prejudice"
"28866",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28867",1342,"      Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed","Pride and prejudice"
"28868",1342,"      him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely","Pride and prejudice"
"28869",1342,"      patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged","Pride and prejudice"
"28870",1342,"      against herself for being so silly!","Pride and prejudice"
"28871",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28872",1342,"      “A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish","Pride and prejudice"
"28873",1342,"      enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the","Pride and prejudice"
"28874",1342,"      sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second","Pride and prejudice"
"28875",1342,"      proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to","Pride and prejudice"
"28876",1342,"      their feelings!”","Pride and prejudice"
"28877",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28878",1342,"      She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his","Pride and prejudice"
"28879",1342,"      coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:","Pride and prejudice"
"28880",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"28881",1342,"      “Is your sister at Pemberley still?”","Pride and prejudice"
"28882",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"

"28887",1342,"      “Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to","Pride and prejudice"

"29061",1342,"      evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get every","Pride and prejudice"
"29062",1342,"      body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter","Pride and prejudice"
"29063",1342,"      to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon","Pride and prejudice"
"29064",1342,"      after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards,","Pride and prejudice"

"29066",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29067",1342,"      But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was","Pride and prejudice"
"29068",1342,"      finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to","Pride and prejudice"
"29069",1342,"      fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening","Pride and prejudice"
"29070",1342,"      the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together","Pride and prejudice"
"29071",1342,"      over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had","Pride and prejudice"
"29072",1342,"      this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily","Pride and prejudice"
"29073",1342,"      turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it","Pride and prejudice"
"29074",1342,"      all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she thought","Pride and prejudice"
"29075",1342,"      was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and","Pride and prejudice"
"29076",1342,"      Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who","Pride and prejudice"
"29077",1342,"      as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering","Pride and prejudice"
"29078",1342,"      a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.","Pride and prejudice"
"29079",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29080",1342,"      Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence","Pride and prejudice"

"29088",1342,"      Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a","Pride and prejudice"

"29107",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29108",1342,"      “And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious","Pride and prejudice"

"29111",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29112",1342,"      In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with","Pride and prejudice"

"29119",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29120",1342,"      He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good","Pride and prejudice"
"29121",1342,"      wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily","Pride and prejudice"
"29122",1342,"      expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They","Pride and prejudice"
"29123",1342,"      shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came","Pride and prejudice"
"29124",1342,"      down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own","Pride and prejudice"
"29125",1342,"      happiness, and of Jane’s perfections; and in spite of his being a","Pride and prejudice"

"29132",1342,"      It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the","Pride and prejudice"

"29136",1342,"      Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation","Pride and prejudice"
"29137",1342,"      in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked","Pride and prejudice"
"29138",1342,"      to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet","Pride and prejudice"
"29139",1342,"      joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how","Pride and prejudice"
"29140",1342,"      really happy he was.","Pride and prejudice"
"29141",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29142",1342,"      Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till","Pride and prejudice"

"29144",1342,"      gone, he turned to his daughter, and said:","Pride and prejudice"
"29145",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29146",1342,"      “Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”","Pride and prejudice"
"29147",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29148",1342,"      Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his","Pride and prejudice"
"29149",1342,"      goodness.","Pride and prejudice"
"29150",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29151",1342,"      “You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in","Pride and prejudice"
"29152",1342,"      thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of","Pride and prejudice"
"29153",1342,"      your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means","Pride and prejudice"
"29154",1342,"      unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever","Pride and prejudice"
"29155",1342,"      be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and","Pride and prejudice"
"29156",1342,"      so generous, that you will always exceed your income.”","Pride and prejudice"
"29157",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29158",1342,"      “I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters","Pride and prejudice"

"29160",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29161",1342,"      “Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what","Pride and prejudice"
"29162",1342,"      are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and","Pride and prejudice"
"29163",1342,"      very likely more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh! my dear,","Pride and prejudice"
"29164",1342,"      dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep","Pride and prejudice"
"29165",1342,"      all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so,","Pride and prejudice"
"29166",1342,"      at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I","Pride and prejudice"
"29167",1342,"      remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into","Pride and prejudice"
"29168",1342,"      Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you","Pride and prejudice"

"29174",1342,"      younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects","Pride and prejudice"

"29176",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29177",1342,"      Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and","Pride and prejudice"
"29178",1342,"      Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.","Pride and prejudice"
"29179",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29180",1342,"      Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at","Pride and prejudice"
"29181",1342,"      Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always","Pride and prejudice"
"29182",1342,"      remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous","Pride and prejudice"
"29183",1342,"      neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an","Pride and prejudice"

"29185",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29186",1342,"      Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her","Pride and prejudice"
"29187",1342,"      sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow","Pride and prejudice"

"29190",1342,"      In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth,","Pride and prejudice"
"29191",1342,"      for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone,","Pride and prejudice"
"29192",1342,"      Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.","Pride and prejudice"
"29193",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29194",1342,"      “He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me","Pride and prejudice"
"29195",1342,"      that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I","Pride and prejudice"

"29197",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29198",1342,"      “I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account","Pride and prejudice"

"29200",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29201",1342,"      “It must have been his sister’s doing. They were certainly no","Pride and prejudice"

"29205",1342,"      brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we","Pride and prejudice"
"29206",1342,"      shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once","Pride and prejudice"

"29208",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29209",1342,"      “That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I","Pride and prejudice"

"29220",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29221",1342,"      This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his","Pride and prejudice"
"29222",1342,"      diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good","Pride and prejudice"
"29223",1342,"      qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed","Pride and prejudice"
"29224",1342,"      the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most","Pride and prejudice"
"29225",1342,"      generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a","Pride and prejudice"

"29228",1342,"      “I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!”","Pride and prejudice"

"29230",1342,"      blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there","Pride and prejudice"

"29254",1342,"      One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane","Pride and prejudice"
"29255",1342,"      had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting","Pride and prejudice"
"29256",1342,"      together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn","Pride and prejudice"
"29257",1342,"      to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a","Pride and prejudice"
"29258",1342,"      chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the","Pride and prejudice"
"29259",1342,"      morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to","Pride and prejudice"
"29260",1342,"      that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and","Pride and prejudice"
"29261",1342,"      neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded","Pride and prejudice"
"29262",1342,"      it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that","Pride and prejudice"
"29263",1342,"      somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet","Pride and prejudice"
"29264",1342,"      to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with","Pride and prejudice"
"29265",1342,"      him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of","Pride and prejudice"
"29266",1342,"      the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction,","Pride and prejudice"
"29267",1342,"      till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was","Pride and prejudice"

"29269",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29270",1342,"      They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their","Pride and prejudice"
"29271",1342,"      astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of","Pride and prejudice"
"29272",1342,"      Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them,","Pride and prejudice"
"29273",1342,"      even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.","Pride and prejudice"
"29274",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29275",1342,"      She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,","Pride and prejudice"
"29276",1342,"      made no other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight","Pride and prejudice"
"29277",1342,"      inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.","Pride and prejudice"
"29278",1342,"      Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship’s","Pride and prejudice"

"29318",1342,"      calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.","Pride and prejudice"
"29319",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29320",1342,"      Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take","Pride and prejudice"
"29321",1342,"      some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not","Pride and prejudice"
"29322",1342,"      very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up,","Pride and prejudice"
"29323",1342,"      said to Elizabeth,","Pride and prejudice"
"29324",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29325",1342,"      “Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little","Pride and prejudice"

"29353",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29354",1342,"      Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.","Pride and prejudice"

"29358",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"29359",1342,"      “Miss Bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought","Pride and prejudice"

"29361",1342,"      _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character","Pride and prejudice"

"29363",1342,"      a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from","Pride and prejudice"
"29364",1342,"      it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I","Pride and prejudice"
"29365",1342,"      was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most","Pride and prejudice"
"29366",1342,"      advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet,","Pride and prejudice"
"29367",1342,"      would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew,","Pride and prejudice"
"29368",1342,"      my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous","Pride and prejudice"
"29369",1342,"      falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose","Pride and prejudice"
"29370",1342,"      the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for","Pride and prejudice"

"30117",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30118",1342,"      “You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot.","Pride and prejudice"
"30119",1342,"      Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in","Pride and prejudice"
"30120",1342,"      such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the","Pride and prejudice"
"30121",1342,"      last time I shall ever remember it myself.”","Pride and prejudice"
"30122",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30123",1342,"      Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more","Pride and prejudice"
"30124",1342,"      seriously assured her of its truth.","Pride and prejudice"
"30125",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30126",1342,"      “Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,”","Pride and prejudice"
"30127",1342,"      cried Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would—I do congratulate","Pride and prejudice"
"30128",1342,"      you—but are you certain? forgive the question—are you quite","Pride and prejudice"
"30129",1342,"      certain that you can be happy with him?”","Pride and prejudice"
"30130",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30131",1342,"      “There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already,","Pride and prejudice"
"30132",1342,"      that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you","Pride and prejudice"
"30133",1342,"      pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?”","Pride and prejudice"
"30134",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30135",1342,"      “Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself","Pride and prejudice"
"30136",1342,"      more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as","Pride and prejudice"
"30137",1342,"      impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh,","Pride and prejudice"
"30138",1342,"      Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you","Pride and prejudice"
"30139",1342,"      quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?”","Pride and prejudice"
"30140",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30141",1342,"      “Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do,","Pride and prejudice"

"30149",1342,"      “My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very","Pride and prejudice"
"30150",1342,"      seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without","Pride and prejudice"

"30153",1342,"      “It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it","Pride and prejudice"
"30154",1342,"      began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his","Pride and prejudice"

"30156",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30157",1342,"      Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the","Pride and prejudice"

"30161",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30162",1342,"      “Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as","Pride and prejudice"

"30164",1342,"      love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as","Pride and prejudice"
"30165",1342,"      Bingley’s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and","Pride and prejudice"
"30166",1342,"      yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very","Pride and prejudice"
"30167",1342,"      reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at","Pride and prejudice"
"30168",1342,"      Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another,","Pride and prejudice"
"30169",1342,"      not to you.”","Pride and prejudice"
"30170",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30171",1342,"      Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been","Pride and prejudice"
"30172",1342,"      unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own","Pride and prejudice"
"30173",1342,"      feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But","Pride and prejudice"
"30174",1342,"      now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia’s","Pride and prejudice"
"30175",1342,"      marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in","Pride and prejudice"

"30177",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30178",1342,"      “Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the","Pride and prejudice"
"30179",1342,"      next morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here","Pride and prejudice"
"30180",1342,"      again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so","Pride and prejudice"
"30181",1342,"      tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he","Pride and prejudice"
"30182",1342,"      would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us","Pride and prejudice"
"30183",1342,"      with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk","Pride and prejudice"
"30184",1342,"      out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s way.”","Pride and prejudice"
"30185",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30186",1342,"      Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal;","Pride and prejudice"
"30187",1342,"      yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him","Pride and prejudice"
"30188",1342,"      such an epithet.","Pride and prejudice"
"30189",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30190",1342,"      As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively,","Pride and prejudice"
"30191",1342,"      and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good","Pride and prejudice"
"30192",1342,"      information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet,","Pride and prejudice"
"30193",1342,"      have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way","Pride and prejudice"
"30194",1342,"      again to-day?”","Pride and prejudice"
"30195",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"

"30198",1342,"      Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.”","Pride and prejudice"
"30199",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30200",1342,"      “It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I","Pride and prejudice"
"30201",1342,"      am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?” Kitty","Pride and prejudice"
"30202",1342,"      owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great","Pride and prejudice"
"30203",1342,"      curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently","Pride and prejudice"
"30204",1342,"      consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet","Pride and prejudice"
"30205",1342,"      followed her, saying:","Pride and prejudice"
"30206",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30207",1342,"      “I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that","Pride and prejudice"
"30208",1342,"      disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind","Pride and prejudice"
"30209",1342,"      it: it is all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion","Pride and prejudice"
"30210",1342,"      for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put","Pride and prejudice"
"30211",1342,"      yourself to inconvenience.”","Pride and prejudice"
"30212",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30213",1342,"      During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent","Pride and prejudice"
"30214",1342,"      should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved","Pride and prejudice"
"30215",1342,"      to herself the application for her mother’s. She could not","Pride and prejudice"
"30216",1342,"      determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting","Pride and prejudice"
"30217",1342,"      whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome","Pride and prejudice"
"30218",1342,"      her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set","Pride and prejudice"
"30219",1342,"      against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain","Pride and prejudice"
"30220",1342,"      that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her","Pride and prejudice"
"30221",1342,"      sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the","Pride and prejudice"
"30222",1342,"      first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her","Pride and prejudice"
"30223",1342,"      disapprobation.","Pride and prejudice"
"30224",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30225",1342,"      In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library,","Pride and prejudice"
"30226",1342,"      she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on","Pride and prejudice"
"30227",1342,"      seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition,","Pride and prejudice"
"30228",1342,"      but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be","Pride and prejudice"
"30229",1342,"      through her means—that _she_, his favourite child, should be","Pride and prejudice"
"30230",1342,"      distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears","Pride and prejudice"
"30231",1342,"      and regrets in disposing of her—was a wretched reflection, and","Pride and prejudice"
"30232",1342,"      she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at","Pride and prejudice"
"30233",1342,"      him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he","Pride and prejudice"
"30234",1342,"      approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while","Pride and prejudice"
"30235",1342,"      pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, “Go to your","Pride and prejudice"
"30236",1342,"      father, he wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.","Pride and prejudice"
"30237",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30238",1342,"      Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.","Pride and prejudice"
"30239",1342,"      “Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your","Pride and prejudice"
"30240",1342,"      senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”","Pride and prejudice"
"30241",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30242",1342,"      How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been","Pride and prejudice"
"30243",1342,"      more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have","Pride and prejudice"
"30244",1342,"      spared her from explanations and professions which it was","Pride and prejudice"
"30245",1342,"      exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she","Pride and prejudice"
"30246",1342,"      assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.","Pride and prejudice"
"30247",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30248",1342,"      “Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich,","Pride and prejudice"
"30249",1342,"      to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages","Pride and prejudice"
"30250",1342,"      than Jane. But will they make you happy?”","Pride and prejudice"
"30251",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30252",1342,"      “Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief","Pride and prejudice"
"30253",1342,"      of my indifference?”","Pride and prejudice"
"30254",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30255",1342,"      “None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of","Pride and prejudice"
"30256",1342,"      man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.”","Pride and prejudice"
"30257",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30258",1342,"      “I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes, “I","Pride and prejudice"
"30259",1342,"      love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly","Pride and prejudice"
"30260",1342,"      amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain","Pride and prejudice"
"30261",1342,"      me by speaking of him in such terms.”","Pride and prejudice"
"30262",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30263",1342,"      “Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the","Pride and prejudice"
"30264",1342,"      kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything,","Pride and prejudice"
"30265",1342,"      which he condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are","Pride and prejudice"
"30266",1342,"      resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of","Pride and prejudice"
"30267",1342,"      it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be","Pride and prejudice"
"30268",1342,"      neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your","Pride and prejudice"
"30269",1342,"      husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively","Pride and prejudice"
"30270",1342,"      talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal","Pride and prejudice"
"30271",1342,"      marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My","Pride and prejudice"
"30272",1342,"      child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to","Pride and prejudice"
"30273",1342,"      respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.”","Pride and prejudice"
"30274",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30275",1342,"      Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her","Pride and prejudice"
"30276",1342,"      reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was","Pride and prejudice"
"30277",1342,"      really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change","Pride and prejudice"
"30278",1342,"      which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute","Pride and prejudice"
"30279",1342,"      certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had","Pride and prejudice"
"30280",1342,"      stood the test of many months’ suspense, and enumerating with","Pride and prejudice"
"30281",1342,"      energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father’s","Pride and prejudice"
"30282",1342,"      incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.","Pride and prejudice"
"30283",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30284",1342,"      “Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no","Pride and prejudice"
"30285",1342,"      more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not","Pride and prejudice"
"30286",1342,"      have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”","Pride and prejudice"
"30287",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30288",1342,"      To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr.","Pride and prejudice"
"30289",1342,"      Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with","Pride and prejudice"
"30290",1342,"      astonishment.","Pride and prejudice"
"30291",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30292",1342,"      “This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every","Pride and prejudice"
"30293",1342,"      thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s","Pride and prejudice"
"30294",1342,"      debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will","Pride and prejudice"
"30295",1342,"      save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle’s","Pride and prejudice"
"30296",1342,"      doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young","Pride and prejudice"
"30297",1342,"      lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him","Pride and prejudice"
"30298",1342,"      to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and","Pride and prejudice"
"30299",1342,"      there will be an end of the matter.”","Pride and prejudice"
"30300",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30301",1342,"      He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his","Pride and prejudice"
"30302",1342,"      reading Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some","Pride and prejudice"
"30303",1342,"      time, allowed her at last to go—saying, as she quitted the room,","Pride and prejudice"
"30304",1342,"      “If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am","Pride and prejudice"
"30305",1342,"      quite at leisure.”","Pride and prejudice"
"30306",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30307",1342,"      Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and,","Pride and prejudice"
"30308",1342,"      after half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was","Pride and prejudice"
"30309",1342,"      able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was","Pride and prejudice"
"30310",1342,"      too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away;","Pride and prejudice"
"30311",1342,"      there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the","Pride and prejudice"
"30312",1342,"      comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.","Pride and prejudice"
"30313",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30314",1342,"      When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she","Pride and prejudice"
"30315",1342,"      followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect","Pride and prejudice"
"30316",1342,"      was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat","Pride and prejudice"
"30317",1342,"      quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under","Pride and prejudice"
"30318",1342,"      many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard;","Pride and prejudice"
"30319",1342,"      though not in general backward to credit what was for the","Pride and prejudice"
"30320",1342,"      advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to","Pride and prejudice"
"30321",1342,"      any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in","Pride and prejudice"
"30322",1342,"      her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.","Pride and prejudice"
"30323",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30324",1342,"      “Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy!","Pride and prejudice"
"30325",1342,"      Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest","Pride and prejudice"
"30326",1342,"      Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what","Pride and prejudice"
"30327",1342,"      jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane’s is nothing to","Pride and prejudice"
"30328",1342,"      it—nothing at all. I am so pleased—so happy. Such a charming","Pride and prejudice"
"30329",1342,"      man!—so handsome! so tall!—Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for","Pride and prejudice"
"30330",1342,"      my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook","Pride and prejudice"
"30331",1342,"      it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is","Pride and prejudice"
"30332",1342,"      charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord!","Pride and prejudice"
"30333",1342,"      What will become of me. I shall go distracted.”","Pride and prejudice"
"30334",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30335",1342,"      This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be","Pride and prejudice"
"30336",1342,"      doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard","Pride and prejudice"
"30337",1342,"      only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three","Pride and prejudice"
"30338",1342,"      minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.","Pride and prejudice"
"30339",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30340",1342,"      “My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else! Ten","Pride and prejudice"
"30341",1342,"      thousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a Lord!","Pride and prejudice"
"30342",1342,"      And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special","Pride and prejudice"
"30343",1342,"      licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is","Pride and prejudice"
"30344",1342,"      particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.”","Pride and prejudice"
"30345",1342,"","Pride and prejudice"
"30346",1342,"      This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the","Pride and prejudice"
"30347",1342,"      gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in","Pride and prejudice"
"30348",1342,"      the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of","Pride and prejudice"
"30349",1342,"      her relations’ consent, there was still something to be wished","Pride and prejudice"

"30800",5200,"could not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was","Metamorphosis"
"30801",5200,"satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short","Metamorphosis"

"30804",5200,"knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. “Gregor,","Metamorphosis"

"30806",5200,"again with a warning deepness in his voice: “Gregor! Gregor!” At the","Metamorphosis"

"30808",5200,"Do you need anything?” Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”,","Metamorphosis"

"30845",5200,"the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned","Metamorphosis"
"30846",5200,"from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might","Metamorphosis"
"30847",5200,"well, at present, be the most sensitive.","Metamorphosis"
"30848",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"30849",5200,"So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first,","Metamorphosis"
"30850",5200,"carefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily,","Metamorphosis"
"30851",5200,"and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually","Metamorphosis"
"30852",5200,"followed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last","Metamorphosis"
"30853",5200,"got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him","Metamorphosis"
"30854",5200,"that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not","Metamorphosis"
"30855",5200,"injured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the","Metamorphosis"
"30856",5200,"same way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better","Metamorphosis"
"30857",5200,"to stay in bed than lose consciousness.","Metamorphosis"
"30858",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"30859",5200,"It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier,","Metamorphosis"
"30860",5200,"but when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as","Metamorphosis"
"30861",5200,"they struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was","Metamorphosis"
"30862",5200,"possible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this","Metamorphosis"
"30863",5200,"chaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to","Metamorphosis"
"30864",5200,"stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free","Metamorphosis"
"30865",5200,"of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time,","Metamorphosis"
"30866",5200,"though, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was","Metamorphosis"
"30867",5200,"much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this","Metamorphosis"
"30868",5200,"he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he","Metamorphosis"
"30869",5200,"could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was","Metamorphosis"
"30870",5200,"enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to","Metamorphosis"
"30871",5200,"offer him. “Seven o’clock, already”, he said to himself when the clock","Metamorphosis"
"30872",5200,"struck again, “seven o’clock, and there’s still a fog like this.” And","Metamorphosis"
"30873",5200,"he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps","Metamorphosis"
"30874",5200,"expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and","Metamorphosis"
"30875",5200,"natural state.","Metamorphosis"
"30876",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"30877",5200,"But then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven I’ll","Metamorphosis"
"30878",5200,"definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody","Metamorphosis"
"30879",5200,"will have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me as well, as","Metamorphosis"
"30880",5200,"they open up at work before seven o’clock.” And so he set himself to","Metamorphosis"
"30881",5200,"the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all","Metamorphosis"
"30882",5200,"at the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and","Metamorphosis"
"30883",5200,"kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.","Metamorphosis"
"30884",5200,"His back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to","Metamorphosis"
"30885",5200,"it falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he","Metamorphosis"
"30886",5200,"was bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably","Metamorphosis"
"30887",5200,"raise concern if not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.","Metamorphosis"
"30888",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"30889",5200,"When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed—the new method","Metamorphosis"
"30890",5200,"was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and","Metamorphosis"
"30891",5200,"forth—it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody","Metamorphosis"
"30892",5200,"came to help him. Two strong people—he had his father and the maid in","Metamorphosis"
"30893",5200,"mind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push","Metamorphosis"
"30894",5200,"their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend","Metamorphosis"
"30895",5200,"down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over","Metamorphosis"
"30896",5200,"onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.","Metamorphosis"
"30897",5200,"Should he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that","Metamorphosis"
"30898",5200,"all the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he","Metamorphosis"
"30899",5200,"could not suppress a smile at this thought.","Metamorphosis"
"30900",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"30901",5200,"After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have","Metamorphosis"
"30902",5200,"been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time","Metamorphosis"
"30903",5200,"was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very","Metamorphosis"
"30904",5200,"soon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. “That’ll be","Metamorphosis"
"30905",5200,"someone from work”, he said to himself, and froze very still, although","Metamorphosis"
"30906",5200,"his little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around.","Metamorphosis"
"30907",5200,"For a moment everything remained quiet. “They’re not opening the door”,","Metamorphosis"
"30908",5200,"Gregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of","Metamorphosis"
"30909",5200,"course, the maid’s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.","Metamorphosis"
"30910",5200,"Gregor only needed to hear the visitor’s first words of greeting and he","Metamorphosis"
"30911",5200,"knew who it was—the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the","Metamorphosis"
"30912",5200,"only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became","Metamorphosis"
"30913",5200,"highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees,","Metamorphosis"
"30914",5200,"every one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful","Metamorphosis"
"30915",5200,"and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he","Metamorphosis"
"30916",5200,"couldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a couple of hours","Metamorphosis"
"30917",5200,"in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one","Metamorphosis"
"30918",5200,"of the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even","Metamorphosis"
"30919",5200,"necessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have","Metamorphosis"
"30920",5200,"to show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that","Metamorphosis"
"30921",5200,"only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate","Metamorphosis"
"30922",5200,"it? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any","Metamorphosis"
"30923",5200,"proper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.","Metamorphosis"
"30924",5200,"There was a loud thump, but it wasn’t really a loud noise. His fall was","Metamorphosis"
"30925",5200,"softened a little by the carpet, and Gregor’s back was also more","Metamorphosis"
"30926",5200,"elastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too","Metamorphosis"
"30927",5200,"noticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit","Metamorphosis"
"30928",5200,"it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against","Metamorphosis"
"30929",5200,"the carpet.","Metamorphosis"
"30930",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"30931",5200,"“Something’s fallen down in there”, said the chief clerk in the room on","Metamorphosis"
"30932",5200,"the left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that","Metamorphosis"
"30933",5200,"had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you","Metamorphosis"
"30934",5200,"had to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this","Metamorphosis"
"30935",5200,"question, the chief clerk’s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots","Metamorphosis"
"30936",5200,"could now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right,","Metamorphosis"
"30937",5200,"Gregor’s sister whispered to him to let him know: “Gregor, the chief","Metamorphosis"
"30938",5200,"clerk is here.” “Yes, I know”, said Gregor to himself; but without","Metamorphosis"
"30939",5200,"daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.","Metamorphosis"
"30940",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"30941",5200,"“Gregor”, said his father now from the room to his left, “the chief","Metamorphosis"
"30942",5200,"clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn’t leave on the","Metamorphosis"
"30943",5200,"early train. We don’t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to","Metamorphosis"
"30944",5200,"speak to you personally. So please open up this door. I’m sure he’ll be","Metamorphosis"
"30945",5200,"good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.” Then the chief","Metamorphosis"
"30946",5200,"clerk called “Good morning, Mr. Samsa”. “He isn’t well”, said his","Metamorphosis"
"30947",5200,"mother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through","Metamorphosis"
"30948",5200,"the door. “He isn’t well, please believe me. Why else would Gregor have","Metamorphosis"
"30949",5200,"missed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly","Metamorphosis"
"30950",5200,"makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he’s been in","Metamorphosis"
"30951",5200,"town for a week now but stayed home every evening. He sits with us in","Metamorphosis"
"30952",5200,"the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. His","Metamorphosis"
"30953",5200,"idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He’s made a little","Metamorphosis"
"30954",5200,"frame, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you’ll be","Metamorphosis"
"30955",5200,"amazed how nice it is; it’s hanging up in his room; you’ll see it as","Metamorphosis"
"30956",5200,"soon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I’m glad you’re here; we","Metamorphosis"
"30957",5200,"wouldn’t have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves;","Metamorphosis"
"30958",5200,"he’s so stubborn; and I’m sure he isn’t well, he said this morning that","Metamorphosis"
"30959",5200,"he is, but he isn’t.” “I’ll be there in a moment”, said Gregor slowly","Metamorphosis"
"30960",5200,"and thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word","Metamorphosis"
"30961",5200,"of the conversation. “Well I can’t think of any other way of explaining","Metamorphosis"
"30962",5200,"it, Mrs. Samsa”, said the chief clerk, “I hope it’s nothing serious.","Metamorphosis"
"30963",5200,"But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever","Metamorphosis"
"30964",5200,"become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like,","Metamorphosis"
"30965",5200,"we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.” “Can","Metamorphosis"
"30966",5200,"the chief clerk come in to see you now then?”, asked his father","Metamorphosis"
"30967",5200,"impatiently, knocking at the door again. “No”, said Gregor. In the room","Metamorphosis"
"30968",5200,"on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left","Metamorphosis"
"30969",5200,"his sister began to cry.","Metamorphosis"
"30970",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"30971",5200,"So why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only","Metamorphosis"
"30972",5200,"just got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she","Metamorphosis"
"30973",5200,"crying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief","Metamorphosis"
"30974",5200,"clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that","Metamorphosis"
"30975",5200,"happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same","Metamorphosis"
"30976",5200,"demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that","Metamorphosis"
"30977",5200,"yet. Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of","Metamorphosis"
"30978",5200,"abandoning his family. For the time being he just lay there on the","Metamorphosis"
"30979",5200,"carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously","Metamorphosis"
"30980",5200,"have expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor","Metamorphosis"
"30981",5200,"discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later","Metamorphosis"
"30982",5200,"on, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.","Metamorphosis"
"30983",5200,"And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace","Metamorphosis"
"30984",5200,"instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the","Metamorphosis"
"30985",5200,"others didn’t know what was happening, they were worried, that would","Metamorphosis"
"30986",5200,"excuse their behaviour.","Metamorphosis"
"30987",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"30988",5200,"The chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr. Samsa”, he called to him,","Metamorphosis"
"30989",5200,"“what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more","Metamorphosis"
"30990",5200,"than yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary","Metamorphosis"
"30991",5200,"concern to your parents and you fail—and I mention this just by the","Metamorphosis"
"30992",5200,"way—you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite","Metamorphosis"
"30993",5200,"unheard of. I’m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your","Metamorphosis"
"30994",5200,"employer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. I","Metamorphosis"
"30995",5200,"am astonished, quite astonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and","Metamorphosis"
"30996",5200,"sensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with","Metamorphosis"
"30997",5200,"peculiar whims. This morning, your employer did suggest a possible","Metamorphosis"
"30998",5200,"reason for your failure to appear, it’s true—it had to do with the","Metamorphosis"
"30999",5200,"money that was recently entrusted to you—but I came near to giving him","Metamorphosis"
"31000",5200,"my word of honour that that could not be the right explanation. But now","Metamorphosis"
"31001",5200,"that I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish","Metamorphosis"
"31002",5200,"whatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is your position all","Metamorphosis"
"31003",5200,"that secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you in","Metamorphosis"
"31004",5200,"private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good","Metamorphosis"
"31005",5200,"reason I don’t see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your","Metamorphosis"
"31006",5200,"turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it’s","Metamorphosis"
"31007",5200,"not the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that;","Metamorphosis"
"31008",5200,"but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr.","Metamorphosis"
"31009",5200,"Samsa, we cannot allow there to be.”","Metamorphosis"
"31010",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31011",5200,"“But Sir”, called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the","Metamorphosis"
"31012",5200,"excitement, “I’ll open up immediately, just a moment. I’m slightly","Metamorphosis"
"31013",5200,"unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven’t been able to get up. I’m","Metamorphosis"
"31014",5200,"still in bed now. I’m quite fresh again now, though. I’m just getting","Metamorphosis"
"31015",5200,"out of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It’s not quite as easy as I’d","Metamorphosis"
"31016",5200,"thought. I’m quite alright now, though. It’s shocking, what can","Metamorphosis"
"31017",5200,"suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents","Metamorphosis"
"31018",5200,"know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last","Metamorphosis"
"31019",5200,"night already. They must have noticed it. I don’t know why I didn’t let","Metamorphosis"
"31020",5200,"you know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness","Metamorphosis"
"31021",5200,"without staying at home. Please, don’t make my parents suffer! There’s","Metamorphosis"
"31022",5200,"no basis for any of the accusations you’re making; nobody’s ever said a","Metamorphosis"
"31023",5200,"word to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven’t read the latest","Metamorphosis"
"31024",5200,"contracts I sent in. I’ll set off with the eight o’clock train, as","Metamorphosis"
"31025",5200,"well, these few hours of rest have given me strength. You don’t need to","Metamorphosis"
"31026",5200,"wait, sir; I’ll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good","Metamorphosis"
"31027",5200,"as to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!”","Metamorphosis"
"31028",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31029",5200,"And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was","Metamorphosis"
"31030",5200,"saying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers—this was easily","Metamorphosis"
"31031",5200,"done, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed—where","Metamorphosis"
"31032",5200,"he now tried to get himself upright. He really did want to open the","Metamorphosis"
"31033",5200,"door, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief","Metamorphosis"
"31034",5200,"clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn","Metamorphosis"
"31035",5200,"what they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked","Metamorphosis"
"31036",5200,"then it would no longer be Gregor’s responsibility and he could rest.","Metamorphosis"
"31037",5200,"If, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason","Metamorphosis"
"31038",5200,"to be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for","Metamorphosis"
"31039",5200,"eight o’clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth","Metamorphosis"
"31040",5200,"chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself","Metamorphosis"
"31041",5200,"one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was","Metamorphosis"
"31042",5200,"in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let","Metamorphosis"
"31043",5200,"himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the","Metamorphosis"
"31044",5200,"edges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and","Metamorphosis"
"31045",5200,"kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.","Metamorphosis"
"31046",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31047",5200,"“Did you understand a word of all that?” the chief clerk asked his","Metamorphosis"
"31048",5200,"parents, “surely he’s not trying to make fools of us”. “Oh, God!”","Metamorphosis"
"31049",5200,"called his mother, who was already in tears, “he could be seriously ill","Metamorphosis"
"31050",5200,"and we’re making him suffer. Grete! Grete!” she then cried. “Mother?”","Metamorphosis"
"31051",5200,"his sister called from the other side. They communicated across","Metamorphosis"
"31052",5200,"Gregor’s room. “You’ll have to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor","Metamorphosis"
"31053",5200,"is ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just","Metamorphosis"
"31054",5200,"now?” “That was the voice of an animal”, said the chief clerk, with a","Metamorphosis"
"31055",5200,"calmness that was in contrast with his mother’s screams. “Anna! Anna!”","Metamorphosis"
"31056",5200,"his father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping","Metamorphosis"
"31057",5200,"his hands, “get a locksmith here, now!” And the two girls, their skirts","Metamorphosis"
"31058",5200,"swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the","Metamorphosis"
"31059",5200,"front door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get","Metamorphosis"
"31060",5200,"dressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again;","Metamorphosis"
"31061",5200,"they must have left it open; people often do in homes where something","Metamorphosis"
"31062",5200,"awful has happened.","Metamorphosis"
"31063",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31064",5200,"Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn’t","Metamorphosis"
"31065",5200,"understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to","Metamorphosis"
"31066",5200,"him, clearer than before—perhaps his ears had become used to the sound.","Metamorphosis"
"31067",5200,"They had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and","Metamorphosis"
"31068",5200,"were ready to help. The first response to his situation had been","Metamorphosis"
"31069",5200,"confident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he had","Metamorphosis"
"31070",5200,"been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith","Metamorphosis"
"31071",5200,"he expected great and surprising achievements—although he did not","Metamorphosis"
"31072",5200,"really distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be","Metamorphosis"
"31073",5200,"crucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he","Metamorphosis"
"31074",5200,"coughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even","Metamorphosis"
"31075",5200,"this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he","Metamorphosis"
"31076",5200,"was no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had","Metamorphosis"
"31077",5200,"become very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the","Metamorphosis"
"31078",5200,"table whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed","Metamorphosis"
"31079",5200,"against the door and listening.","Metamorphosis"
"31080",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31081",5200,"Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once","Metamorphosis"
"31082",5200,"there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself","Metamorphosis"
"31083",5200,"upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He","Metamorphosis"
"31084",5200,"rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and","Metamorphosis"
"31085",5200,"then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his","Metamorphosis"
"31086",5200,"mouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth—how was he,","Metamorphosis"
"31087",5200,"then, to grasp the key?—but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up","Metamorphosis"
"31088",5200,"for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start","Metamorphosis"
"31089",5200,"the key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some","Metamorphosis"
"31090",5200,"kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the","Metamorphosis"
"31091",5200,"key and dripped onto the floor. “Listen”, said the chief clerk in the","Metamorphosis"
"31092",5200,"next room, “he’s turning the key.” Gregor was greatly encouraged by","Metamorphosis"

"31094",5200,"mother too: “Well done, Gregor”, they should have cried, “keep at it,","Metamorphosis"
"31095",5200,"keep hold of the lock!” And with the idea that they were all excitedly","Metamorphosis"
"31096",5200,"following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying","Metamorphosis"
"31097",5200,"no attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned","Metamorphosis"
"31098",5200,"round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright","Metamorphosis"
"31099",5200,"with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the","Metamorphosis"
"31100",5200,"whole weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it","Metamorphosis"
"31101",5200,"snapped back was Gregor’s sign that he could break his concentration,","Metamorphosis"
"31102",5200,"and as he regained his breath he said to himself: “So, I didn’t need","Metamorphosis"
"31103",5200,"the locksmith after all”. Then he lay his head on the handle of the","Metamorphosis"
"31104",5200,"door to open it completely.","Metamorphosis"
"31105",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31106",5200,"Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open","Metamorphosis"
"31107",5200,"before he could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one","Metamorphosis"
"31108",5200,"of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not","Metamorphosis"
"31109",5200,"want to fall flat on his back before entering the room. He was still","Metamorphosis"
"31110",5200,"occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to","Metamorphosis"
"31111",5200,"anything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud “Oh!”,","Metamorphosis"
"31112",5200,"which sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him—he was","Metamorphosis"
"31113",5200,"the nearest to the door—his hand pressed against his open mouth and","Metamorphosis"
"31114",5200,"slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.","Metamorphosis"
"31115",5200,"Gregor’s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief","Metamorphosis"
"31116",5200,"clerk’s being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms,","Metamorphosis"
"31117",5200,"took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into","Metamorphosis"
"31118",5200,"her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head","Metamorphosis"
"31119",5200,"disappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and","Metamorphosis"
"31120",5200,"clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.","Metamorphosis"
"31121",5200,"Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with","Metamorphosis"
"31122",5200,"his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.","Metamorphosis"
"31123",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31124",5200,"So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the","Metamorphosis"
"31125",5200,"other door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half","Metamorphosis"
"31126",5200,"of his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant","Metamorphosis"
"31127",5200,"over to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had","Metamorphosis"
"31128",5200,"become much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the","Metamorphosis"
"31129",5200,"other side of the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite","Metamorphosis"
"31130",5200,"clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its","Metamorphosis"
"31131",5200,"façade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual","Metamorphosis"
"31132",5200,"droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from","Metamorphosis"
"31133",5200,"breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for","Metamorphosis"
"31134",5200,"Gregor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and","Metamorphosis"
"31135",5200,"he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of","Metamorphosis"
"31136",5200,"different newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph","Metamorphosis"
"31137",5200,"of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand","Metamorphosis"
"31138",5200,"and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his","Metamorphosis"
"31139",5200,"uniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the","Metamorphosis"
"31140",5200,"front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and","Metamorphosis"
"31141",5200,"the stairs where they began their way down below.","Metamorphosis"
"31142",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31143",5200,"“Now, then”, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have","Metamorphosis"
"31144",5200,"kept calm, “I’ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and","Metamorphosis"
"31145",5200,"set off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see”, he said to","Metamorphosis"
"31146",5200,"the chief clerk, “that I’m not stubborn and I like to do my job; being","Metamorphosis"
"31147",5200,"a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn’t","Metamorphosis"
"31148",5200,"earn my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you","Metamorphosis"
"31149",5200,"report everything accurately, then? It’s quite possible for someone to","Metamorphosis"
"31150",5200,"be temporarily unable to work, but that’s just the right time to","Metamorphosis"
"31151",5200,"remember what’s been achieved in the past and consider that later on,","Metamorphosis"
"31152",5200,"once the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all","Metamorphosis"

"31154",5200,"seriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my","Metamorphosis"
"31155",5200,"parents and my sister, so that I’m trapped in a difficult situation,","Metamorphosis"
"31156",5200,"but I will work my way out of it again. Please don’t make things any","Metamorphosis"
"31157",5200,"harder for me than they are already, and don’t take sides against me at","Metamorphosis"
"31158",5200,"the office. I know that nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn","Metamorphosis"
"31159",5200,"an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That’s just","Metamorphosis"
"31160",5200,"prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But","Metamorphosis"
"31161",5200,"you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in","Metamorphosis"
"31162",5200,"fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss","Metamorphosis"
"31163",5200,"himself—it’s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes","Metamorphosis"
"31164",5200,"about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And","Metamorphosis"
"31165",5200,"you’re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year","Metamorphosis"
"31166",5200,"away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip","Metamorphosis"
"31167",5200,"and chance and groundless complaints, and it’s almost impossible to","Metamorphosis"
"31168",5200,"defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don’t usually even hear","Metamorphosis"
"31169",5200,"about them, or if at all it’s when we arrive back home exhausted from a","Metamorphosis"

"31176",5200,"speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his","Metamorphosis"
"31177",5200,"trembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment","Metamorphosis"
"31178",5200,"while Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without","Metamorphosis"
"31179",5200,"taking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been","Metamorphosis"
"31180",5200,"some secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had","Metamorphosis"
"31181",5200,"reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot","Metamorphosis"
"31182",5200,"from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he","Metamorphosis"
"31183",5200,"stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there,","Metamorphosis"
"31184",5200,"there were some supernatural force waiting to save him.","Metamorphosis"
"31185",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31186",5200,"Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk","Metamorphosis"
"31187",5200,"go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into","Metamorphosis"
"31188",5200,"extreme danger. That was something his parents did not understand very","Metamorphosis"
"31189",5200,"well; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would","Metamorphosis"
"31190",5200,"provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much","Metamorphosis"
"31191",5200,"to worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for","Metamorphosis"
"31192",5200,"the future. Gregor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk","Metamorphosis"
"31193",5200,"had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the","Metamorphosis"
"31194",5200,"future of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his sister were","Metamorphosis"
"31195",5200,"here! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still","Metamorphosis"
"31196",5200,"lying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women,","Metamorphosis"
"31197",5200,"surely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the","Metamorphosis"
"31198",5200,"entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was","Metamorphosis"
"31199",5200,"not there, Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without","Metamorphosis"
"31200",5200,"considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move","Metamorphosis"
"31201",5200,"about in his present state, or that his speech still might not—or","Metamorphosis"
"31202",5200,"probably would not—be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself","Metamorphosis"
"31203",5200,"through the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,","Metamorphosis"
"31204",5200,"ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but","Metamorphosis"
"31205",5200,"Gregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought","Metamorphosis"
"31206",5200,"something to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs. Hardly had","Metamorphosis"
"31207",5200,"that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel","Metamorphosis"
"31208",5200,"alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them;","Metamorphosis"
"31209",5200,"to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even","Metamorphosis"
"31210",5200,"making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon","Metamorphosis"
"31211",5200,"believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. He held","Metamorphosis"
"31212",5200,"back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there","Metamorphosis"
"31213",5200,"on the floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed,","Metamorphosis"
"31214",5200,"at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up","Metamorphosis"
"31215",5200,"with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: “Help, for","Metamorphosis"
"31216",5200,"pity’s sake, Help!” The way she held her head suggested she wanted to","Metamorphosis"
"31217",5200,"see Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards","Metamorphosis"
"31218",5200,"showed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind","Metamorphosis"
"31219",5200,"her with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she","Metamorphosis"
"31220",5200,"sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even","Metamorphosis"
"31221",5200,"seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush","Metamorphosis"
"31222",5200,"of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.","Metamorphosis"
"31223",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31224",5200,"“Mother, mother”, said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had","Metamorphosis"
"31225",5200,"completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help","Metamorphosis"
"31226",5200,"himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of","Metamorphosis"
"31227",5200,"coffee. That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and","Metamorphosis"
"31228",5200,"into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her. Gregor, though,","Metamorphosis"
"31229",5200,"had no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already","Metamorphosis"
"31230",5200,"reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for","Metamorphosis"
"31231",5200,"the last time. Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of","Metamorphosis"
"31232",5200,"reaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt","Metamorphosis"
"31233",5200,"down several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all","Metamorphosis"
"31234",5200,"around the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed,","Metamorphosis"
"31235",5200,"unfortunately, to put Gregor’s father into a panic as well. Until then","Metamorphosis"
"31236",5200,"he had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running","Metamorphosis"
"31237",5200,"after the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he","Metamorphosis"
"31238",5200,"ran after him, Gregor’s father seized the chief clerk’s stick in his","Metamorphosis"
"31239",5200,"right hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with","Metamorphosis"
"31240",5200,"his hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with","Metamorphosis"
"31241",5200,"his left, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping","Metamorphosis"
"31242",5200,"his foot at him as he went. Gregor’s appeals to his father were of no","Metamorphosis"
"31243",5200,"help, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly","Metamorphosis"
"31244",5200,"turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.","Metamorphosis"
"31245",5200,"Across the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor’s mother had pulled","Metamorphosis"
"31246",5200,"open a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A","Metamorphosis"
"31247",5200,"strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the","Metamorphosis"
"31248",5200,"curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of","Metamorphosis"
"31249",5200,"them were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor’s father as","Metamorphosis"
"31250",5200,"he drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. Gregor","Metamorphosis"
"31251",5200,"had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go","Metamorphosis"
"31252",5200,"very slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would","Metamorphosis"
"31253",5200,"have been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he","Metamorphosis"
"31254",5200,"took the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there","Metamorphosis"
"31255",5200,"was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in","Metamorphosis"
"31256",5200,"his father’s hand any moment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that","Metamorphosis"
"31257",5200,"he had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable","Metamorphosis"
"31258",5200,"of going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as","Metamorphosis"
"31259",5200,"possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn","Metamorphosis"
"31260",5200,"himself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to","Metamorphosis"
"31261",5200,"see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now","Metamorphosis"
"31262",5200,"and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a","Metamorphosis"
"31263",5200,"distance as to which way to turn. If only his father would stop that","Metamorphosis"
"31264",5200,"unbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused. When he had","Metamorphosis"
"31265",5200,"nearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made","Metamorphosis"
"31266",5200,"a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come. He","Metamorphosis"
"31267",5200,"was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but","Metamorphosis"
"31268",5200,"then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get","Metamorphosis"
"31269",5200,"through it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it","Metamorphosis"
"31270",5200,"obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double","Metamorphosis"
"31271",5200,"doors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was","Metamorphosis"
"31272",5200,"merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room","Metamorphosis"
"31273",5200,"as quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time","Metamorphosis"
"31274",5200,"to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.","Metamorphosis"
"31275",5200,"What he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards","Metamorphosis"
"31276",5200,"all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to","Metamorphosis"
"31277",5200,"Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not","Metamorphosis"
"31278",5200,"a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway","Metamorphosis"
"31279",5200,"without regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted","Metamorphosis"
"31280",5200,"itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the","Metamorphosis"
"31281",5200,"white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,","Metamorphosis"
"31282",5200,"soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by","Metamorphosis"
"31283",5200,"himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while","Metamorphosis"
"31284",5200,"those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then","Metamorphosis"
"31285",5200,"his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from","Metamorphosis"
"31286",5200,"where he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into","Metamorphosis"
"31287",5200,"his room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all","Metamorphosis"
"31288",5200,"was quiet.","Metamorphosis"
"31289",5200,"","Metamorphosis"

"31294",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31295",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31296",5200,"It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke","Metamorphosis"
"31297",5200,"from his deep and coma-like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards","Metamorphosis"
"31298",5200,"anyway even if he hadn’t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and","Metamorphosis"
"31299",5200,"felt fully rested. But he had the impression that some hurried steps","Metamorphosis"
"31300",5200,"and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully","Metamorphosis"
"31301",5200,"shut had woken him. The light from the electric street lamps shone","Metamorphosis"
"31302",5200,"palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but","Metamorphosis"
"31303",5200,"down below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushed himself over to","Metamorphosis"
"31304",5200,"the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae—of which he was","Metamorphosis"
"31305",5200,"now beginning to learn the value—in order to see what had been","Metamorphosis"
"31306",5200,"happening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully","Metamorphosis"
"31307",5200,"stretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the","Metamorphosis"
"31308",5200,"legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning—it was nearly","Metamorphosis"
"31309",5200,"a miracle that only one of them had been—and dragged along lifelessly.","Metamorphosis"
"31310",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31311",5200,"It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it","Metamorphosis"
"31312",5200,"actually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of","Metamorphosis"
"31313",5200,"something to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened","Metamorphosis"
"31314",5200,"milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. He was so","Metamorphosis"
"31315",5200,"pleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been","Metamorphosis"
"31316",5200,"that morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly","Metamorphosis"
"31317",5200,"covering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head back again in","Metamorphosis"
"31318",5200,"disappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it","Metamorphosis"
"31319",5200,"difficult to eat the food—he was only able to eat if his whole body","Metamorphosis"
"31320",5200,"worked together as a snuffling whole—but the milk did not taste at all","Metamorphosis"
"31321",5200,"nice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister","Metamorphosis"
"31322",5200,"had certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned,","Metamorphosis"
"31323",5200,"almost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into","Metamorphosis"
"31324",5200,"the centre of the room.","Metamorphosis"
"31325",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31326",5200,"Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been","Metamorphosis"
"31327",5200,"lit in the living room. His father at this time would normally be sat","Metamorphosis"
"31328",5200,"with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor’s","Metamorphosis"
"31329",5200,"mother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to","Metamorphosis"
"31330",5200,"be heard. Gregor’s sister would often write and tell him about this","Metamorphosis"
"31331",5200,"reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. It","Metamorphosis"
"31332",5200,"was so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody","Metamorphosis"
"31333",5200,"in the flat. “What a quiet life it is the family lead”, said Gregor to","Metamorphosis"
"31334",5200,"himself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he was","Metamorphosis"
"31335",5200,"able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and","Metamorphosis"
"31336",5200,"parents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should","Metamorphosis"
"31337",5200,"come to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that Gregor","Metamorphosis"
"31338",5200,"did not want to think about too much, so he started to move about,","Metamorphosis"
"31339",5200,"crawling up and down the room.","Metamorphosis"
"31340",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31341",5200,"Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was","Metamorphosis"
"31342",5200,"opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on","Metamorphosis"
"31343",5200,"the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the","Metamorphosis"
"31344",5200,"room but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by","Metamorphosis"
"31345",5200,"the door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room","Metamorphosis"
"31346",5200,"in some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened","Metamorphosis"
"31347",5200,"no more that night and Gregor waited in vain. The previous morning","Metamorphosis"

"31349",5200,"but now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had","Metamorphosis"
"31350",5200,"clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the","Metamorphosis"
"31351",5200,"keys were in the other sides.","Metamorphosis"
"31352",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31353",5200,"It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was","Metamorphosis"
"31354",5200,"put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had","Metamorphosis"
"31355",5200,"stayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as","Metamorphosis"
"31356",5200,"they went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come","Metamorphosis"
"31357",5200,"into Gregor’s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time","Metamorphosis"
"31358",5200,"to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.","Metamorphosis"
"31359",5200,"For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain","Metamorphosis"
"31360",5200,"made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he","Metamorphosis"
"31361",5200,"had been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing","Metamorphosis"
"31362",5200,"other than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch. It","Metamorphosis"
"31363",5200,"pressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift","Metamorphosis"
"31364",5200,"his head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only","Metamorphosis"
"31365",5200,"regret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.","Metamorphosis"
"31366",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31367",5200,"He spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light","Metamorphosis"
"31368",5200,"sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his","Metamorphosis"
"31369",5200,"hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes","Metamorphosis"
"31370",5200,"which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being","Metamorphosis"
"31371",5200,"he must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest","Metamorphosis"
"31372",5200,"consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he,","Metamorphosis"
"31373",5200,"in his present condition, was forced to impose on them.","Metamorphosis"
"31374",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31375",5200,"Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions,","Metamorphosis"
"31376",5200,"as early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his","Metamorphosis"
"31377",5200,"sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and","Metamorphosis"
"31378",5200,"looked anxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when she","Metamorphosis"
"31379",5200,"did notice him under the couch—he had to be somewhere, for God’s sake,","Metamorphosis"
"31380",5200,"he couldn’t have flown away—she was so shocked that she lost control of","Metamorphosis"
"31381",5200,"herself and slammed the door shut again from outside. But she seemed to","Metamorphosis"
"31382",5200,"regret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and","Metamorphosis"
"31383",5200,"came in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or","Metamorphosis"
"31384",5200,"even of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the","Metamorphosis"
"31385",5200,"edge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left","Metamorphosis"
"31386",5200,"the milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and","Metamorphosis"
"31387",5200,"bring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn’t do","Metamorphosis"
"31388",5200,"it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,","Metamorphosis"
"31389",5200,"although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the","Metamorphosis"
"31390",5200,"couch, throw himself at his sister’s feet and beg her for something","Metamorphosis"
"31391",5200,"good to eat. However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and","Metamorphosis"
"31392",5200,"looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some","Metamorphosis"
"31393",5200,"surprise. She immediately picked it up—using a rag, not her bare","Metamorphosis"
"31394",5200,"hands—and carried it out. Gregor was extremely curious as to what she","Metamorphosis"
"31395",5200,"would bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he","Metamorphosis"
"31396",5200,"never could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did","Metamorphosis"
"31397",5200,"bring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of","Metamorphosis"
"31398",5200,"things, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten","Metamorphosis"
"31399",5200,"vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that","Metamorphosis"
"31400",5200,"had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had","Metamorphosis"
"31401",5200,"declared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread","Metamorphosis"
"31402",5200,"with butter and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water","Metamorphosis"
"31403",5200,"into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for","Metamorphosis"
"31404",5200,"Gregor’s use, and placed it beside them. Then, out of consideration for","Metamorphosis"
"31405",5200,"Gregor’s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her,","Metamorphosis"
"31406",5200,"she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that","Metamorphosis"
"31407",5200,"Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he","Metamorphosis"
"31408",5200,"liked. Gregor’s little legs whirred, at last he could eat. What’s more,","Metamorphosis"
"31409",5200,"his injuries must already have completely healed as he found no","Metamorphosis"
"31410",5200,"difficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he","Metamorphosis"
"31411",5200,"had cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how his finger","Metamorphosis"
"31412",5200,"had still hurt the day before yesterday. “Am I less sensitive than I","Metamorphosis"
"31413",5200,"used to be, then?”, he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the","Metamorphosis"
"31414",5200,"cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much","Metamorphosis"
"31415",5200,"more than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another,","Metamorphosis"
"31416",5200,"his eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables","Metamorphosis"
"31417",5200,"and the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn’t like at","Metamorphosis"
"31418",5200,"all, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away","Metamorphosis"
"31419",5200,"from them because he couldn’t stand the smell. Long after he had","Metamorphosis"
"31420",5200,"finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly","Metamorphosis"
"31421",5200,"turned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw. He","Metamorphosis"
"31422",5200,"was immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he","Metamorphosis"
"31423",5200,"hurried back under the couch. But he needed great self-control to stay","Metamorphosis"
"31424",5200,"there even for the short time that his sister was in the room, as","Metamorphosis"
"31425",5200,"eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could","Metamorphosis"
"31426",5200,"hardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with","Metamorphosis"
"31427",5200,"bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up","Metamorphosis"
"31428",5200,"the left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at","Metamorphosis"
"31429",5200,"all as if it could not be used any more. She quickly dropped it all","Metamorphosis"
"31430",5200,"into a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out.","Metamorphosis"
"31431",5200,"She had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under","Metamorphosis"
"31432",5200,"the couch and stretched himself.","Metamorphosis"
"31433",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31434",5200,"This was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning","Metamorphosis"
"31435",5200,"while his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time","Metamorphosis"
"31436",5200,"after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would","Metamorphosis"
"31437",5200,"sleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor’s sister would send","Metamorphosis"
"31438",5200,"the maid away on some errand. Gregor’s father and mother certainly did","Metamorphosis"
"31439",5200,"not want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than","Metamorphosis"
"31440",5200,"they could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being","Metamorphosis"
"31441",5200,"told about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what","Metamorphosis"
"31442",5200,"distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.","Metamorphosis"
"31443",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31444",5200,"It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor","Metamorphosis"
"31445",5200,"and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. As","Metamorphosis"
"31446",5200,"nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that","Metamorphosis"
"31447",5200,"he could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister’s","Metamorphosis"
"31448",5200,"sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was","Metamorphosis"
"31449",5200,"only later, when she had become a little more used to everything—there","Metamorphosis"
"31450",5200,"was, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the","Metamorphosis"
"31451",5200,"situation—that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at","Metamorphosis"
"31452",5200,"least a comment that could be construed as friendly. “He’s enjoyed his","Metamorphosis"
"31453",5200,"dinner today”, she might say when he had diligently cleared away all","Metamorphosis"
"31454",5200,"the food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became","Metamorphosis"
"31455",5200,"more and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, “now everything’s","Metamorphosis"
"31456",5200,"just been left there again”.","Metamorphosis"
"31457",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31458",5200,"Although Gregor wasn’t able to hear any news directly he did listen to","Metamorphosis"
"31459",5200,"much of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard anyone","Metamorphosis"
"31460",5200,"speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his","Metamorphosis"
"31461",5200,"whole body against it. There was seldom any conversation, especially at","Metamorphosis"
"31462",5200,"first, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret. For","Metamorphosis"
"31463",5200,"two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they","Metamorphosis"
"31464",5200,"should do now; but even between meals they spoke about the same subject","Metamorphosis"
"31465",5200,"as there were always at least two members of the family at home—nobody","Metamorphosis"
"31466",5200,"wanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to","Metamorphosis"
"31467",5200,"leave the flat entirely empty. And on the very first day the maid had","Metamorphosis"
"31468",5200,"fallen to her knees and begged Gregor’s mother to let her go without","Metamorphosis"
"31469",5200,"delay. It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but","Metamorphosis"
"31470",5200,"she left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor’s","Metamorphosis"
"31471",5200,"mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service.","Metamorphosis"
"31472",5200,"She even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what","Metamorphosis"
"31473",5200,"had happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.","Metamorphosis"
"31474",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31475",5200,"Now Gregor’s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking;","Metamorphosis"
"31476",5200,"although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much. Gregor","Metamorphosis"
"31477",5200,"often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat,","Metamorphosis"
"31478",5200,"and receive no more answer than “no thanks, I’ve had enough” or","Metamorphosis"
"31479",5200,"something similar. No-one drank very much either. His sister would","Metamorphosis"
"31480",5200,"sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the","Metamorphosis"
"31481",5200,"chance to go and fetch it herself. When his father then said nothing","Metamorphosis"
"31482",5200,"she would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send","Metamorphosis"
"31483",5200,"the housekeeper for it, but then his father would close the matter with","Metamorphosis"
"31484",5200,"a big, loud “No”, and no more would be said.","Metamorphosis"
"31485",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31486",5200,"Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained","Metamorphosis"
"31487",5200,"to Gregor’s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were.","Metamorphosis"
"31488",5200,"Now and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or","Metamorphosis"
"31489",5200,"document from the little cash box he had saved from his business when","Metamorphosis"
"31490",5200,"it had collapsed five years earlier. Gregor heard how he opened the","Metamorphosis"
"31491",5200,"complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item","Metamorphosis"
"31492",5200,"he wanted. What he heard his father say was some of the first good news","Metamorphosis"
"31493",5200,"that Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room. He","Metamorphosis"
"31494",5200,"had thought that nothing at all remained from his father’s business, at","Metamorphosis"
"31495",5200,"least he had never told him anything different, and Gregor had never","Metamorphosis"
"31496",5200,"asked him about it anyway. Their business misfortune had reduced the","Metamorphosis"
"31497",5200,"family to a state of total despair, and Gregor’s only concern at that","Metamorphosis"
"31498",5200,"time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it","Metamorphosis"
"31499",5200,"as quickly as possible. So then he started working especially hard,","Metamorphosis"
"31500",5200,"with a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a","Metamorphosis"
"31501",5200,"travelling representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance","Metamorphosis"
"31502",5200,"to earn money in quite different ways. Gregor converted his success at","Metamorphosis"
"31503",5200,"work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the","Metamorphosis"
"31504",5200,"benefit of his astonished and delighted family. They had been good","Metamorphosis"
"31505",5200,"times and they had never come again, at least not with the same","Metamorphosis"
"31506",5200,"splendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a","Metamorphosis"
"31507",5200,"position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. They","Metamorphosis"
"31508",5200,"had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the","Metamorphosis"
"31509",5200,"money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was","Metamorphosis"
"31510",5200,"no longer much warm affection given in return. Gregor only remained","Metamorphosis"
"31511",5200,"close to his sister now. Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a","Metamorphosis"
"31512",5200,"gifted and expressive violinist, it was his secret plan to send her to","Metamorphosis"
"31513",5200,"the conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense","Metamorphosis"
"31514",5200,"that would have to be made up for in some other way. During Gregor’s","Metamorphosis"
"31515",5200,"short periods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to","Metamorphosis"
"31516",5200,"the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that","Metamorphosis"
"31517",5200,"could never be realised. Their parents did not like to hear this","Metamorphosis"
"31518",5200,"innocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he","Metamorphosis"
"31519",5200,"would let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on","Metamorphosis"
"31520",5200,"Christmas day.","Metamorphosis"
"31521",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31522",5200,"That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind","Metamorphosis"
"31523",5200,"in his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.","Metamorphosis"
"31524",5200,"There were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening,","Metamorphosis"
"31525",5200,"when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it","Metamorphosis"
"31526",5200,"up again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be","Metamorphosis"
"31527",5200,"heard next door and they would all go silent. “What’s that he’s doing","Metamorphosis"
"31528",5200,"now”, his father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to","Metamorphosis"
"31529",5200,"the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be","Metamorphosis"
"31530",5200,"taken up again.","Metamorphosis"
"31531",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31532",5200,"When explaining things, his father repeated himself several times,","Metamorphosis"
"31533",5200,"partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these","Metamorphosis"
"31534",5200,"matters himself and partly because Gregor’s mother did not understand","Metamorphosis"
"31535",5200,"everything the first time. From these repeated explanations Gregor","Metamorphosis"
"31536",5200,"learned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was","Metamorphosis"
"31537",5200,"still some money available from the old days. It was not a lot, but it","Metamorphosis"
"31538",5200,"had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated.","Metamorphosis"
"31539",5200,"Besides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had","Metamorphosis"
"31540",5200,"been bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so","Metamorphosis"
"31541",5200,"that that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, Gregor nodded","Metamorphosis"
"31542",5200,"with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution.","Metamorphosis"
"31543",5200,"He could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father’s","Metamorphosis"
"31544",5200,"debt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from","Metamorphosis"
"31545",5200,"that job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better","Metamorphosis"
"31546",5200,"the way his father had done things.","Metamorphosis"
"31547",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31548",5200,"This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to","Metamorphosis"
"31549",5200,"live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one","Metamorphosis"
"31550",5200,"or two years, no more. That’s to say, it was money that should not","Metamorphosis"
"31551",5200,"really be touched but set aside for emergencies; money to live on had","Metamorphosis"
"31552",5200,"to be earned. His father was healthy but old, and lacking in self","Metamorphosis"
"31553",5200,"confidence. During the five years that he had not been working—the","Metamorphosis"
"31554",5200,"first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success—he","Metamorphosis"
"31555",5200,"had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. Would","Metamorphosis"
"31556",5200,"Gregor’s elderly mother now have to go and earn money? She suffered","Metamorphosis"
"31557",5200,"from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home,","Metamorphosis"
"31558",5200,"every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the","Metamorphosis"
"31559",5200,"open window. Would his sister have to go and earn money? She was still","Metamorphosis"
"31560",5200,"a child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable,","Metamorphosis"
"31561",5200,"consisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the","Metamorphosis"
"31562",5200,"business, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all","Metamorphosis"
"31563",5200,"playing the violin. Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn","Metamorphosis"
"31564",5200,"money, Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw","Metamorphosis"
"31565",5200,"himself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot","Metamorphosis"
"31566",5200,"with shame and regret.","Metamorphosis"
"31567",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31568",5200,"He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink","Metamorphosis"
"31569",5200,"but scratching at the leather for hours on end. Or he might go to all","Metamorphosis"
"31570",5200,"the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill","Metamorphosis"
"31571",5200,"and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it.","Metamorphosis"
"31572",5200,"He had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing","Metamorphosis"
"31573",5200,"it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as","Metamorphosis"
"31574",5200,"what he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day,","Metamorphosis"
"31575",5200,"even things that were quite near; he had used to curse the ever-present","Metamorphosis"
"31576",5200,"view of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at","Metamorphosis"
"31577",5200,"all, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which","Metamorphosis"
"31578",5200,"was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could","Metamorphosis"
"31579",5200,"have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where","Metamorphosis"
"31580",5200,"the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant","Metamorphosis"
"31581",5200,"sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always","Metamorphosis"
"31582",5200,"push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied","Metamorphosis"
"31583",5200,"up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then","Metamorphosis"
"31584",5200,"on.","Metamorphosis"
"31585",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31586",5200,"If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for","Metamorphosis"
"31587",5200,"all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to","Metamorphosis"
"31588",5200,"bear it; but as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried","Metamorphosis"
"31589",5200,"as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it,","Metamorphosis"
"31590",5200,"and the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so,","Metamorphosis"
"31591",5200,"but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much","Metamorphosis"
"31592",5200,"better. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she","Metamorphosis"
"31593",5200,"entered the room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly","Metamorphosis"
"31594",5200,"close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the","Metamorphosis"
"31595",5200,"view into Gregor’s room, then she would go straight to the window and","Metamorphosis"
"31596",5200,"pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it","Metamorphosis"
"31597",5200,"was cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little","Metamorphosis"
"31598",5200,"while. She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and","Metamorphosis"
"31599",5200,"noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while,","Metamorphosis"
"31600",5200,"knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this","Metamorphosis"
"31601",5200,"ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him","Metamorphosis"
"31602",5200,"with the windows closed.","Metamorphosis"
"31603",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31604",5200,"One day, about a month after Gregor’s transformation when his sister no","Metamorphosis"

"31606",5200,"came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still","Metamorphosis"
"31607",5200,"staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most","Metamorphosis"
"31608",5200,"horrible. In itself, his sister’s not coming into the room would have","Metamorphosis"
"31609",5200,"been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to","Metamorphosis"
"31610",5200,"immediately open the window while he was still there, but not only did","Metamorphosis"
"31611",5200,"she not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her,","Metamorphosis"
"31612",5200,"a stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite","Metamorphosis"
"31613",5200,"her. Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course,","Metamorphosis"
"31614",5200,"but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she","Metamorphosis"
"31615",5200,"seemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she still","Metamorphosis"
"31616",5200,"found his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she","Metamorphosis"
"31617",5200,"probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little","Metamorphosis"
"31618",5200,"bit of him that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to","Metamorphosis"
"31619",5200,"spare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet","Metamorphosis"
"31620",5200,"over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely","Metamorphosis"
"31621",5200,"covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent","Metamorphosis"
"31622",5200,"down. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to","Metamorphosis"
"31623",5200,"do was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no","Metamorphosis"
"31624",5200,"pleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely. She left the","Metamorphosis"
"31625",5200,"sheet where it was. Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude","Metamorphosis"
"31626",5200,"one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how","Metamorphosis"
"31627",5200,"his sister liked the new arrangement.","Metamorphosis"
"31628",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31629",5200,"For the first fourteen days, Gregor’s parents could not bring","Metamorphosis"
"31630",5200,"themselves to come into the room to see him. He would often hear them","Metamorphosis"
"31631",5200,"say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even","Metamorphosis"
"31632",5200,"though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless","Metamorphosis"
"31633",5200,"and frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father","Metamorphosis"
"31634",5200,"and mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor’s room","Metamorphosis"
"31635",5200,"while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again","Metamorphosis"
"31636",5200,"she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor","Metamorphosis"
"31637",5200,"had eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any","Metamorphosis"
"31638",5200,"slight improvement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go in and","Metamorphosis"
"31639",5200,"visit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first","Metamorphosis"
"31640",5200,"persuaded her against it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and","Metamorphosis"
"31641",5200,"approved fully. Later, though, she had to be held back by force, which","Metamorphosis"
"31642",5200,"made her call out: “Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son!","Metamorphosis"
"31643",5200,"Can’t you understand I have to see him?”, and Gregor would think to","Metamorphosis"
"31644",5200,"himself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every","Metamorphosis"
"31645",5200,"day of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand","Metamorphosis"
"31646",5200,"everything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was","Metamorphosis"
"31647",5200,"still just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult’s","Metamorphosis"
"31648",5200,"appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.","Metamorphosis"
"31649",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31650",5200,"Gregor’s wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration","Metamorphosis"
"31651",5200,"for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during","Metamorphosis"
"31652",5200,"the day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room","Metamorphosis"
"31653",5200,"to crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his","Metamorphosis"
"31654",5200,"food soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain","Metamorphosis"
"31655",5200,"himself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and","Metamorphosis"
"31656",5200,"ceiling. He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was","Metamorphosis"
"31657",5200,"quite different from lying on the floor; he could breathe more freely;","Metamorphosis"
"31658",5200,"his body had a light swing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost","Metamorphosis"
"31659",5200,"happy, it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting","Metamorphosis"
"31660",5200,"go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash. But now, of","Metamorphosis"
"31661",5200,"course, he had far better control of his body than before and, even","Metamorphosis"
"31662",5200,"with a fall as great as that, caused himself no damage. Very soon his","Metamorphosis"
"31663",5200,"sister noticed Gregor’s new way of entertaining himself—he had, after","Metamorphosis"
"31664",5200,"all, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about—and","Metamorphosis"
"31665",5200,"got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing","Metamorphosis"
"31666",5200,"the furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of drawers and","Metamorphosis"
"31667",5200,"the desk. Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by","Metamorphosis"
"31668",5200,"herself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen","Metamorphosis"
"31669",5200,"year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she","Metamorphosis"
"31670",5200,"certainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be","Metamorphosis"
"31671",5200,"allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to","Metamorphosis"
"31672",5200,"open the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no","Metamorphosis"
"31673",5200,"choice but to choose some time when Gregor’s father was not there and","Metamorphosis"
"31674",5200,"fetch his mother to help her. As she approached the room, Gregor could","Metamorphosis"
"31675",5200,"hear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent.","Metamorphosis"
"31676",5200,"First, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that","Metamorphosis"
"31677",5200,"everything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her","Metamorphosis"
"31678",5200,"mother enter. Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the","Metamorphosis"
"31679",5200,"couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if","Metamorphosis"
"31680",5200,"it had just been thrown down by chance. Gregor also refrained, this","Metamorphosis"
"31681",5200,"time, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to","Metamorphosis"
"31682",5200,"see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come. “You","Metamorphosis"
"31683",5200,"can come in, he can’t be seen”, said his sister, obviously leading her","Metamorphosis"
"31684",5200,"in by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of","Metamorphosis"
"31685",5200,"feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it","Metamorphosis"
"31686",5200,"from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the","Metamorphosis"
"31687",5200,"work for herself and ignoring her mother’s warnings that she would","Metamorphosis"
"31688",5200,"strain herself. This lasted a very long time. After labouring at it for","Metamorphosis"
"31689",5200,"fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the","Metamorphosis"
"31690",5200,"chest where it was, for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the","Metamorphosis"
"31691",5200,"job finished before Gregor’s father got home and leaving it in the","Metamorphosis"
"31692",5200,"middle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for another","Metamorphosis"
"31693",5200,"thing it wasn’t even sure that taking the furniture away would really","Metamorphosis"
"31694",5200,"be any help to him. She thought just the opposite; the sight of the","Metamorphosis"
"31695",5200,"bare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn’t Gregor","Metamorphosis"
"31696",5200,"feel the same way about it, he’d been used to this furniture in his","Metamorphosis"
"31697",5200,"room for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an","Metamorphosis"
"31698",5200,"empty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting","Metamorphosis"
"31699",5200,"Gregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone","Metamorphosis"
"31700",5200,"of her voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her","Metamorphosis"
"31701",5200,"words, she added “and by taking the furniture away, won’t it seem like","Metamorphosis"
"31702",5200,"we’re showing that we’ve given up all hope of improvement and we’re","Metamorphosis"
"31703",5200,"abandoning him to cope for himself? I think it’d be best to leave the","Metamorphosis"
"31704",5200,"room exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us","Metamorphosis"
"31705",5200,"again he’ll find everything unchanged and he’ll be able to forget the","Metamorphosis"
"31706",5200,"time in between all the easier”.","Metamorphosis"
"31707",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31708",5200,"Hearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the lack","Metamorphosis"
"31709",5200,"of any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led","Metamorphosis"
"31710",5200,"by the family during these two months, must have made him confused—he","Metamorphosis"
"31711",5200,"could think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had","Metamorphosis"
"31712",5200,"seriously wanted his room emptied out. Had he really wanted to","Metamorphosis"
"31713",5200,"transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice","Metamorphosis"
"31714",5200,"furniture he had inherited? That would have let him crawl around","Metamorphosis"
"31715",5200,"unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quickly","Metamorphosis"
"31716",5200,"forget his past when he had still been human. He had come very close to","Metamorphosis"
"31717",5200,"forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for","Metamorphosis"
"31718",5200,"so long, that had shaken him out of it. Nothing should be removed;","Metamorphosis"
"31719",5200,"everything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the","Metamorphosis"
"31720",5200,"furniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult","Metamorphosis"
"31721",5200,"for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great","Metamorphosis"
"31722",5200,"advantage.","Metamorphosis"
"31723",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31724",5200,"His sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the","Metamorphosis"
"31725",5200,"idea, not without reason, that she was Gregor’s spokesman to his","Metamorphosis"
"31726",5200,"parents about the things that concerned him. This meant that his","Metamorphosis"
"31727",5200,"mother’s advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing","Metamorphosis"
"31728",5200,"not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had thought at","Metamorphosis"
"31729",5200,"first, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch. It was","Metamorphosis"
"31730",5200,"more than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence","Metamorphosis"
"31731",5200,"she had recently acquired, that made her insist; she had indeed noticed","Metamorphosis"
"31732",5200,"that Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the","Metamorphosis"
"31733",5200,"furniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to him at all.","Metamorphosis"
"31734",5200,"Girls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel","Metamorphosis"
"31735",5200,"they must get their way whenever they can. Perhaps this was what","Metamorphosis"
"31736",5200,"tempted Grete to make Gregor’s situation seem even more shocking than","Metamorphosis"
"31737",5200,"it was so that she could do even more for him. Grete would probably be","Metamorphosis"
"31738",5200,"the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling","Metamorphosis"
"31739",5200,"about the bare walls by himself.","Metamorphosis"
"31740",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31741",5200,"So she refused to let her mother dissuade her. Gregor’s mother already","Metamorphosis"
"31742",5200,"looked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped","Metamorphosis"
"31743",5200,"Gregor’s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she","Metamorphosis"
"31744",5200,"had. The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if","Metamorphosis"
"31745",5200,"he had to, but the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the two women","Metamorphosis"
"31746",5200,"pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than Gregor","Metamorphosis"
"31747",5200,"poked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about","Metamorphosis"
"31748",5200,"it. He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but,","Metamorphosis"
"31749",5200,"unfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the","Metamorphosis"
"31750",5200,"next room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it from","Metamorphosis"
"31751",5200,"side to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch. His","Metamorphosis"
"31752",5200,"mother was not used to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill,","Metamorphosis"
"31753",5200,"so Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. In his","Metamorphosis"
"31754",5200,"startlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front","Metamorphosis"
"31755",5200,"from moving a little. It was enough to attract his mother’s attention.","Metamorphosis"
"31756",5200,"She stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out","Metamorphosis"
"31757",5200,"to Grete.","Metamorphosis"
"31758",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31759",5200,"Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was","Metamorphosis"
"31760",5200,"happening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all,","Metamorphosis"
"31761",5200,"but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little","Metamorphosis"
"31762",5200,"calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all","Metamorphosis"
"31763",5200,"these things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides.","Metamorphosis"
"31764",5200,"With his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to","Metamorphosis"
"31765",5200,"the floor, he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand","Metamorphosis"
"31766",5200,"all of this much longer. They were emptying his room out; taking away","Metamorphosis"
"31767",5200,"everything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chest","Metamorphosis"
"31768",5200,"containing his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove","Metamorphosis"
"31769",5200,"the writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk","Metamorphosis"
"31770",5200,"where he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school,","Metamorphosis"
"31771",5200,"even while he had been at infant school—he really could not wait any","Metamorphosis"
"31772",5200,"longer to see whether the two women’s intentions were good. He had","Metamorphosis"
"31773",5200,"nearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to","Metamorphosis"
"31774",5200,"say anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as","Metamorphosis"
"31775",5200,"they stepped heavily on the floor.","Metamorphosis"
"31776",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31777",5200,"So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room","Metamorphosis"
"31778",5200,"catching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not","Metamorphosis"
"31779",5200,"knowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly","Metamorphosis"
"31780",5200,"caught by the picture on the wall—which was already denuded of","Metamorphosis"
"31781",5200,"everything else that had been on it—of the lady dressed in copious fur.","Metamorphosis"
"31782",5200,"He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass,","Metamorphosis"
"31783",5200,"it held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly. This picture at","Metamorphosis"
"31784",5200,"least, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by","Metamorphosis"
"31785",5200,"no-one. He turned his head to face the door into the living room so","Metamorphosis"
"31786",5200,"that he could watch the women when they came back.","Metamorphosis"
"31787",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31788",5200,"They had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon;","Metamorphosis"
"31789",5200,"Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her.","Metamorphosis"
"31790",5200,"“What shall we take now, then?”, said Grete and looked around. Her eyes","Metamorphosis"
"31791",5200,"met those of Gregor on the wall. Perhaps only because her mother was","Metamorphosis"
"31792",5200,"there, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not","Metamorphosis"
"31793",5200,"look round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice:","Metamorphosis"
"31794",5200,"“Come on, let’s go back in the living room for a while?” Gregor could","Metamorphosis"
"31795",5200,"see what Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere","Metamorphosis"
"31796",5200,"safe and then chase him down from the wall. Well, she could certainly","Metamorphosis"
"31797",5200,"try it! He sat unyielding on his picture. He would rather jump at","Metamorphosis"
"31798",5200,"Grete’s face.","Metamorphosis"
"31799",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31800",5200,"But Grete’s words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one","Metamorphosis"
"31801",5200,"side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the","Metamorphosis"
"31802",5200,"wallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw","Metamorphosis"
"31803",5200,"screamed: “Oh God, oh God!” Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch","Metamorphosis"
"31804",5200,"as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. “Gregor!”","Metamorphosis"
"31805",5200,"shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the","Metamorphosis"
"31806",5200,"first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. She","Metamorphosis"
"31807",5200,"ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring","Metamorphosis"
"31808",5200,"her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too—he could save","Metamorphosis"
"31809",5200,"his picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull","Metamorphosis"
"31810",5200,"himself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he","Metamorphosis"
"31811",5200,"could advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand","Metamorphosis"
"31812",5200,"behind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he","Metamorphosis"
"31813",5200,"startled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and","Metamorphosis"
"31814",5200,"broke; a splinter cut Gregor’s face, some kind of caustic medicine","Metamorphosis"
"31815",5200,"splashed all over him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took","Metamorphosis"
"31816",5200,"hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother;","Metamorphosis"
"31817",5200,"she slammed the door shut with her foot. So now Gregor was shut out","Metamorphosis"
"31818",5200,"from his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could","Metamorphosis"
"31819",5200,"not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she","Metamorphosis"
"31820",5200,"had to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait;","Metamorphosis"
"31821",5200,"and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about,","Metamorphosis"
"31822",5200,"he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in","Metamorphosis"
"31823",5200,"his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down","Metamorphosis"
"31824",5200,"into the middle of the dinner table.","Metamorphosis"
"31825",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31826",5200,"He lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was","Metamorphosis"
"31827",5200,"quiet, maybe that was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door.","Metamorphosis"
"31828",5200,"The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete","Metamorphosis"
"31829",5200,"would have to go and answer it. His father had arrived home. “What’s","Metamorphosis"
"31830",5200,"happened?” were his first words; Grete’s appearance must have made","Metamorphosis"
"31831",5200,"everything clear to him. She answered him with subdued voice, and","Metamorphosis"
"31832",5200,"openly pressed her face into his chest: “Mother’s fainted, but she’s","Metamorphosis"
"31833",5200,"better now. Gregor got out.” “Just as I expected”, said his father,","Metamorphosis"
"31834",5200,"“just as I always said, but you women wouldn’t listen, would you.” It","Metamorphosis"
"31835",5200,"was clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father","Metamorphosis"
"31836",5200,"took it to mean that something bad had happened, that he was","Metamorphosis"
"31837",5200,"responsible for some act of violence. That meant Gregor would now have","Metamorphosis"
"31838",5200,"to try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain","Metamorphosis"
"31839",5200,"things to him even if that had been possible. So he fled to the door of","Metamorphosis"
"31840",5200,"his room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he","Metamorphosis"
"31841",5200,"came in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor had the best","Metamorphosis"
"31842",5200,"intentions and would go back into his room without delay, that it would","Metamorphosis"
"31843",5200,"not be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the","Metamorphosis"
"31844",5200,"door and he would disappear.","Metamorphosis"
"31845",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"31846",5200,"His father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that;","Metamorphosis"
"31847",5200,"“Ah!”, he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both angry and","Metamorphosis"
"31848",5200,"glad at the same time. Gregor drew his head back from the door and","Metamorphosis"
"31849",5200,"lifted it towards his father. He really had not imagined his father the","Metamorphosis"
"31850",5200,"way he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about,","Metamorphosis"
"31851",5200,"he had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the","Metamorphosis"
"31852",5200,"flat the way he had done before. He really ought to have expected","Metamorphosis"
"31853",5200,"things to have changed, but still, still, was that really his father?","Metamorphosis"
"31854",5200,"The same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when","Metamorphosis"
"31855",5200,"Gregor came back from his business trips, who would receive him sitting","Metamorphosis"
"31856",5200,"in the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings; who","Metamorphosis"
"31857",5200,"was hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would","Metamorphosis"

"31863",5200,"and, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his","Metamorphosis"

"31871",5200,"an arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his","Metamorphosis"
"31872",5200,"trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and,","Metamorphosis"
"31873",5200,"with look of determination, walked towards Gregor. He probably did not","Metamorphosis"
"31874",5200,"even know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet","Metamorphosis"
"31875",5200,"unusually high. Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of","Metamorphosis"

"31877",5200,"the first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to","Metamorphosis"

"31881",5200,"without anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression","Metamorphosis"
"31882",5200,"of a chase as everything went so slowly. Gregor remained all this time","Metamorphosis"
"31883",5200,"on the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it as","Metamorphosis"
"31884",5200,"especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever he","Metamorphosis"
"31885",5200,"did, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up","Metamorphosis"
"31886",5200,"this running about for long, as for each step his father took he had to","Metamorphosis"
"31887",5200,"carry out countless movements. He became noticeably short of breath,","Metamorphosis"

"31892",5200,"he almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although,","Metamorphosis"
"31893",5200,"here, they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of","Metamorphosis"
"31894",5200,"notches and protrusions—then, right beside him, lightly tossed,","Metamorphosis"
"31895",5200,"something flew down and rolled in front of him. It was an apple; then","Metamorphosis"

"31897",5200,"no longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard","Metamorphosis"
"31898",5200,"him. He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the","Metamorphosis"
"31899",5200,"sideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw","Metamorphosis"
"31900",5200,"one apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the","Metamorphosis"

"32077",5200,"repelled by Gregor. Just by chance one day, rather than any real","Metamorphosis"
"32078",5200,"curiosity, she opened the door to Gregor’s room and found herself face","Metamorphosis"
"32079",5200,"to face with him. He was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing","Metamorphosis"
"32080",5200,"him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in","Metamorphosis"
"32081",5200,"amazement with her hands crossed in front of her. From then on she","Metamorphosis"
"32082",5200,"never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and","Metamorphosis"
"32083",5200,"look briefly in on him. At first she would call to him as she did so","Metamorphosis"
"32084",5200,"with words that she probably considered friendly, such as “come on","Metamorphosis"

"32086",5200,"Gregor never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just","Metamorphosis"
"32087",5200,"remained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been","Metamorphosis"
"32088",5200,"opened. If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every","Metamorphosis"

"32090",5200,"like it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the","Metamorphosis"
"32091",5200,"windowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to","Metamorphosis"
"32092",5200,"speak to him in that way once again. Gregor was so resentful of it that","Metamorphosis"
"32093",5200,"he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it was like","Metamorphosis"
"32094",5200,"a kind of attack. Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up","Metamorphosis"
"32095",5200,"one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth","Metamorphosis"
"32096",5200,"open, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her","Metamorphosis"
"32097",5200,"hand had been slammed down into Gregor’s back. “Aren’t you coming any","Metamorphosis"
"32098",5200,"closer, then?”, she asked when Gregor turned round again, and she","Metamorphosis"

"32103",5200,"some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours","Metamorphosis"
"32104",5200,"and then, more often than not, spit it out again. At first he thought","Metamorphosis"
"32105",5200,"it was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but","Metamorphosis"
"32106",5200,"he had soon got used to the changes made there. They had got into the","Metamorphosis"
"32107",5200,"habit of putting things into this room that they had no room for","Metamorphosis"
"32108",5200,"anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms","Metamorphosis"
"32109",5200,"in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest","Metamorphosis"
"32110",5200,"gentlemen—all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering","Metamorphosis"
"32111",5200,"through the crack in the door one day—were painfully insistent on","Metamorphosis"

"32113",5200,"they had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and","Metamorphosis"
"32114",5200,"especially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they could","Metamorphosis"

"32116",5200,"most of their own furnishings and equipment with them. For this reason,","Metamorphosis"
"32117",5200,"many things had become superfluous which, although they could not be","Metamorphosis"
"32118",5200,"sold, the family did not wish to discard. All these things found their","Metamorphosis"
"32119",5200,"way into Gregor’s room. The dustbins from the kitchen found their way","Metamorphosis"
"32120",5200,"in there too. The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she","Metamorphosis"
"32121",5200,"couldn’t use for the time being she would just chuck in there. He,","Metamorphosis"
"32122",5200,"fortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand","Metamorphosis"
"32123",5200,"that held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out","Metamorphosis"
"32124",5200,"again when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out","Metamorphosis"
"32125",5200,"in one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where","Metamorphosis"
"32126",5200,"they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way","Metamorphosis"
"32127",5200,"through the junk and moved it somewhere else. At first he moved it","Metamorphosis"
"32128",5200,"because, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was","Metamorphosis"
"32129",5200,"forced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in","Metamorphosis"
"32130",5200,"that way left him sad and tired to death, and he would remain immobile","Metamorphosis"
"32131",5200,"for hours afterwards.","Metamorphosis"
"32132",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32133",5200,"The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening","Metamorphosis"
"32134",5200,"meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the","Metamorphosis"
"32135",5200,"door to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But Gregor","Metamorphosis"
"32136",5200,"found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often","Metamorphosis"
"32137",5200,"failed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family","Metamorphosis"
"32138",5200,"having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner. One time,","Metamorphosis"
"32139",5200,"though, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open,","Metamorphosis"
"32140",5200,"and it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in","Metamorphosis"
"32141",5200,"the evening and the light was put on. They sat up at the table where,","Metamorphosis"
"32142",5200,"formerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they","Metamorphosis"
"32143",5200,"unfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks. Gregor’s","Metamorphosis"
"32144",5200,"mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon","Metamorphosis"
"32145",5200,"behind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. The","Metamorphosis"
"32146",5200,"food was steaming, and filled the room with its smell. The gentlemen","Metamorphosis"
"32147",5200,"bent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the","Metamorphosis"
"32148",5200,"food before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to","Metamorphosis"
"32149",5200,"count as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of","Metamorphosis"
"32150",5200,"meat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish","Metamorphosis"
"32151",5200,"whether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to","Metamorphosis"
"32152",5200,"the kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor’s mother and","Metamorphosis"
"32153",5200,"sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and","Metamorphosis"
"32154",5200,"smiled.","Metamorphosis"
"32155",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32156",5200,"The family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Gregor’s father","Metamorphosis"
"32157",5200,"came into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once","Metamorphosis"
"32158",5200,"with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen","Metamorphosis"
"32159",5200,"stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards. Then, once they","Metamorphosis"
"32160",5200,"were alone, they ate in near perfect silence. It seemed remarkable to","Metamorphosis"
"32161",5200,"Gregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth","Metamorphosis"
"32162",5200,"could still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you","Metamorphosis"
"32163",5200,"need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything","Metamorphosis"
"32164",5200,"with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. “I’d like to","Metamorphosis"
"32165",5200,"eat something”, said Gregor anxiously, “but not anything like they’re","Metamorphosis"
"32166",5200,"eating. They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!”","Metamorphosis"
"32167",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32168",5200,"Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the","Metamorphosis"
"32169",5200,"violin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the","Metamorphosis"
"32170",5200,"kitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one","Metamorphosis"
"32171",5200,"in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the","Metamorphosis"
"32172",5200,"others, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and","Metamorphosis"
"32173",5200,"smoking. When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up","Metamorphosis"
"32174",5200,"and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood","Metamorphosis"
"32175",5200,"pressed against each other. Someone must have heard them in the","Metamorphosis"
"32176",5200,"kitchen, as Gregor’s father called out: “Is the playing perhaps","Metamorphosis"
"32177",5200,"unpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away.” “On the","Metamorphosis"
"32178",5200,"contrary”, said the middle gentleman, “would the young lady not like to","Metamorphosis"
"32179",5200,"come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much","Metamorphosis"
"32180",5200,"more cosy and comfortable?” “Oh yes, we’d love to”, called back","Metamorphosis"
"32181",5200,"Gregor’s father as if he had been the violin player himself. The","Metamorphosis"
"32182",5200,"gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. Gregor’s father soon","Metamorphosis"
"32183",5200,"appeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister","Metamorphosis"
"32184",5200,"with the violin. She calmly prepared everything for her to begin","Metamorphosis"
"32185",5200,"playing; his parents, who had never rented a room out before and","Metamorphosis"
"32186",5200,"therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen,","Metamorphosis"
"32187",5200,"did not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his father leant against","Metamorphosis"
"32188",5200,"the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his","Metamorphosis"
"32189",5200,"uniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the","Metamorphosis"
"32190",5200,"gentlemen and sat—leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to","Metamorphosis"
"32191",5200,"have placed it—out of the way in a corner.","Metamorphosis"
"32192",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32193",5200,"His sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one","Metamorphosis"
"32194",5200,"on each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing,","Metamorphosis"
"32195",5200,"Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in","Metamorphosis"
"32196",5200,"the living room. Before, he had taken great pride in how considerate he","Metamorphosis"
"32197",5200,"was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless","Metamorphosis"
"32198",5200,"about the others. What’s more, there was now all the more reason to","Metamorphosis"
"32199",5200,"keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere","Metamorphosis"
"32200",5200,"in his room and flew up at the slightest movement; he carried threads,","Metamorphosis"
"32201",5200,"hairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; he was much too","Metamorphosis"
"32202",5200,"indifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on","Metamorphosis"
"32203",5200,"the carpet like he had used to do several times a day. And despite this","Metamorphosis"
"32204",5200,"condition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the","Metamorphosis"
"32205",5200,"immaculate floor of the living room.","Metamorphosis"
"32206",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32207",5200,"No-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the","Metamorphosis"
"32208",5200,"violin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in","Metamorphosis"
"32209",5200,"their pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look","Metamorphosis"
"32210",5200,"at all the notes being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor’s","Metamorphosis"
"32211",5200,"sister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they withdrew back to","Metamorphosis"
"32212",5200,"the window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half","Metamorphosis"
"32213",5200,"volume, and they stayed by the window while Gregor’s father observed","Metamorphosis"
"32214",5200,"them anxiously. It really now seemed very obvious that they had","Metamorphosis"
"32215",5200,"expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had","Metamorphosis"
"32216",5200,"been disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole performance","Metamorphosis"
"32217",5200,"and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to","Metamorphosis"
"32218",5200,"be disturbed. It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the","Metamorphosis"
"32219",5200,"smoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. Yet","Metamorphosis"
"32220",5200,"Gregor’s sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one","Metamorphosis"
"32221",5200,"side, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy","Metamorphosis"
"32222",5200,"expression. Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head","Metamorphosis"
"32223",5200,"close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came.","Metamorphosis"
"32224",5200,"Was he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that","Metamorphosis"
"32225",5200,"he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been","Metamorphosis"
"32226",5200,"yearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister","Metamorphosis"
"32227",5200,"and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her","Metamorphosis"
"32228",5200,"violin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He","Metamorphosis"
"32229",5200,"never wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway;","Metamorphosis"
"32230",5200,"his shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he","Metamorphosis"
"32231",5200,"wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the","Metamorphosis"
"32232",5200,"attackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though,","Metamorphosis"
"32233",5200,"but stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch","Metamorphosis"
"32234",5200,"with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always","Metamorphosis"
"32235",5200,"intended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told","Metamorphosis"
"32236",5200,"everyone about it last Christmas—had Christmas really come and gone","Metamorphosis"
"32237",5200,"already?—if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and refuse to let","Metamorphosis"
"32238",5200,"anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would","Metamorphosis"
"32239",5200,"break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her","Metamorphosis"
"32240",5200,"shoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to","Metamorphosis"
"32241",5200,"work, she had kept free without any necklace or collar.","Metamorphosis"
"32242",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32243",5200,"“Mr. Samsa!”, shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor’s father,","Metamorphosis"
"32244",5200,"pointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor","Metamorphosis"
"32245",5200,"as he slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the","Metamorphosis"
"32246",5200,"three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and","Metamorphosis"
"32247",5200,"then looked back at Gregor. His father seemed to think it more","Metamorphosis"
"32248",5200,"important to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even","Metamorphosis"
"32249",5200,"though they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more","Metamorphosis"
"32250",5200,"entertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them","Metamorphosis"
"32251",5200,"with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their","Metamorphosis"
"32252",5200,"room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his","Metamorphosis"
"32253",5200,"body. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear","Metamorphosis"
"32254",5200,"whether it was his father’s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning","Metamorphosis"
"32255",5200,"realisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room","Metamorphosis"
"32256",5200,"without knowing it. They asked Gregor’s father for explanations, raised","Metamorphosis"
"32257",5200,"their arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back","Metamorphosis"
"32258",5200,"towards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor’s sister had","Metamorphosis"
"32259",5200,"overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly","Metamorphosis"
"32260",5200,"interrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang","Metamorphosis"
"32261",5200,"limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still","Metamorphosis"
"32262",5200,"playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the","Metamorphosis"
"32263",5200,"instrument on her mother’s lap who still sat laboriously struggling for","Metamorphosis"
"32264",5200,"breath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure","Metamorphosis"
"32265",5200,"from her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.","Metamorphosis"
"32266",5200,"Under his sister’s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds","Metamorphosis"
"32267",5200,"flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the","Metamorphosis"
"32268",5200,"beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the","Metamorphosis"
"32269",5200,"room. Gregor’s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he","Metamorphosis"
"32270",5200,"forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and","Metamorphosis"
"32271",5200,"pressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the","Metamorphosis"
"32272",5200,"middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot","Metamorphosis"
"32273",5200,"and thereby brought Gregor’s father to a halt. “I declare here and","Metamorphosis"
"32274",5200,"now”, he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor’s mother and","Metamorphosis"
"32275",5200,"sister to gain their attention too, “that with regard to the repugnant","Metamorphosis"
"32276",5200,"conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family”—here he","Metamorphosis"
"32277",5200,"looked briefly but decisively at the floor—“I give immediate notice on","Metamorphosis"
"32278",5200,"my room. For the days that I have been living here I will, of course,","Metamorphosis"
"32279",5200,"pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed","Metamorphosis"
"32280",5200,"with some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would","Metamorphosis"
"32281",5200,"be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.” He was silent","Metamorphosis"
"32282",5200,"and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And indeed, his","Metamorphosis"
"32283",5200,"two friends joined in with the words: “And we also give immediate","Metamorphosis"
"32284",5200,"notice.” With that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the","Metamorphosis"
"32285",5200,"door.","Metamorphosis"
"32286",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32287",5200,"Gregor’s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his","Metamorphosis"
"32288",5200,"hands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out","Metamorphosis"
"32289",5200,"for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept","Metamorphosis"
"32290",5200,"nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout","Metamorphosis"
"32291",5200,"all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first","Metamorphosis"
"32292",5200,"seen him. His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps","Metamorphosis"
"32293",5200,"also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to","Metamorphosis"
"32294",5200,"move. He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he","Metamorphosis"
"32295",5200,"waited. He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on","Metamorphosis"
"32296",5200,"his mother’s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on","Metamorphosis"
"32297",5200,"the floor.","Metamorphosis"
"32298",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32299",5200,"“Father, Mother”, said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as","Metamorphosis"
"32300",5200,"introduction, “we can’t carry on like this. Maybe you can’t see it, but","Metamorphosis"
"32301",5200,"I can. I don’t want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is:","Metamorphosis"
"32302",5200,"we have to try and get rid of it. We’ve done all that’s humanly","Metamorphosis"
"32303",5200,"possible to look after it and be patient, I don’t think anyone could","Metamorphosis"
"32304",5200,"accuse us of doing anything wrong.”","Metamorphosis"
"32305",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32306",5200,"“She’s absolutely right”, said Gregor’s father to himself. His mother,","Metamorphosis"
"32307",5200,"who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully,","Metamorphosis"
"32308",5200,"her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her","Metamorphosis"
"32309",5200,"eyes.","Metamorphosis"
"32310",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32311",5200,"Gregor’s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead.","Metamorphosis"
"32312",5200,"Her words seemed to give Gregor’s father some more definite ideas. He","Metamorphosis"
"32313",5200,"sat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the","Metamorphosis"
"32314",5200,"three gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at","Metamorphosis"
"32315",5200,"Gregor as he lay there immobile.","Metamorphosis"
"32316",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32317",5200,"“We have to try and get rid of it”, said Gregor’s sister, now speaking","Metamorphosis"
"32318",5200,"only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to","Metamorphosis"
"32319",5200,"listen, “it’ll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming. We","Metamorphosis"
"32320",5200,"can’t all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured","Metamorphosis"
"32321",5200,"like this, we can’t endure it. I can’t endure it any more.” And she","Metamorphosis"
"32322",5200,"broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her","Metamorphosis"
"32323",5200,"mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements.","Metamorphosis"
"32324",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32325",5200,"“My child”, said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding,","Metamorphosis"
"32326",5200,"“what are we to do?”","Metamorphosis"
"32327",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32328",5200,"His sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness","Metamorphosis"

"32330",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32331",5200,"“If he could just understand us”, said his father almost as a question;","Metamorphosis"

"32333",5200,"of that there was no question.","Metamorphosis"
"32334",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32335",5200,"“If he could just understand us”, repeated Gregor’s father, closing his","Metamorphosis"
"32336",5200,"eyes in acceptance of his sister’s certainty that that was quite","Metamorphosis"
"32337",5200,"impossible, “then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement","Metamorphosis"
"32338",5200,"with him. But as it is ...”","Metamorphosis"
"32339",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32340",5200,"“It’s got to go”, shouted his sister, “that’s the only way, Father.","Metamorphosis"
"32341",5200,"You’ve got to get rid of the idea that that’s Gregor. We’ve only harmed","Metamorphosis"
"32342",5200,"ourselves by believing it for so long. How can that be Gregor? If it","Metamorphosis"
"32343",5200,"were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it’s not possible for","Metamorphosis"
"32344",5200,"human beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of","Metamorphosis"
"32345",5200,"his own free will. We wouldn’t have a brother any more, then, but we","Metamorphosis"
"32346",5200,"could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect. As it is","Metamorphosis"
"32347",5200,"this animal is persecuting us, it’s driven out our tenants, it","Metamorphosis"
"32348",5200,"obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on","Metamorphosis"
"32349",5200,"the streets. Father, look, just look”, she suddenly screamed, “he’s","Metamorphosis"
"32350",5200,"starting again!” In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor’s","Metamorphosis"
"32351",5200,"comprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed","Metamorphosis"
"32352",5200,"herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her","Metamorphosis"
"32353",5200,"own mother than stay anywhere near Gregor. She rushed over to behind","Metamorphosis"
"32354",5200,"her father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up","Metamorphosis"
"32355",5200,"half raising his hands in front of Gregor’s sister as if to protect","Metamorphosis"
"32356",5200,"her.","Metamorphosis"
"32357",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32358",5200,"But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his","Metamorphosis"
"32359",5200,"sister. All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go","Metamorphosis"
"32360",5200,"back into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his","Metamorphosis"
"32361",5200,"pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal","Metamorphosis"
"32362",5200,"of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly","Metamorphosis"
"32363",5200,"raising it and striking it against the floor. He stopped and looked","Metamorphosis"
"32364",5200,"round. They seemed to have realised his good intention and had only","Metamorphosis"
"32365",5200,"been alarmed briefly. Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence.","Metamorphosis"
"32366",5200,"His mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed","Metamorphosis"
"32367",5200,"against each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister","Metamorphosis"
"32368",5200,"sat next to his father with her arms around his neck.","Metamorphosis"
"32369",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32370",5200,"“Maybe now they’ll let me turn round”, thought Gregor and went back to","Metamorphosis"

"32372",5200,"sometimes to stop and take a rest. No-one was making him rush any more,","Metamorphosis"
"32373",5200,"everything was left up to him. As soon as he had finally finished","Metamorphosis"

"32382",5200,"to see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood","Metamorphosis"

"32396",5200,"actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was","Metamorphosis"
"32397",5200,"unnatural. He also felt relatively comfortable. It is true that his","Metamorphosis"
"32398",5200,"entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker","Metamorphosis"

"32412",5200,"she still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she’d arrived and","Metamorphosis"
"32413",5200,"from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace—she made her usual","Metamorphosis"

"32415",5200,"he was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she","Metamorphosis"
"32416",5200,"attributed all possible understanding to him. She happened to be","Metamorphosis"
"32417",5200,"holding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with","Metamorphosis"

"32420",5200,"found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all","Metamorphosis"
"32421",5200,"did she start to pay attention. She soon realised what had really","Metamorphosis"

"32423",5200,"time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness","Metamorphosis"
"32424",5200,"of the bedrooms: “Come and ’ave a look at this, it’s dead, just lying","Metamorphosis"

"32426",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32427",5200,"Mr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to","Metamorphosis"
"32428",5200,"make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they","Metamorphosis"
"32429",5200,"could grasp what she was saying. But then, each from his own side, they","Metamorphosis"
"32430",5200,"hurried out of bed. Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders,","Metamorphosis"
"32431",5200,"Mrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is how they went","Metamorphosis"
"32432",5200,"into Gregor’s room. On the way they opened the door to the living room","Metamorphosis"
"32433",5200,"where Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in;","Metamorphosis"
"32434",5200,"she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness","Metamorphosis"
"32435",5200,"of her face seemed to confirm this. “Dead?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, looking","Metamorphosis"
"32436",5200,"at the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for","Metamorphosis"
"32437",5200,"herself and could have known it even without checking. “That’s what I","Metamorphosis"
"32438",5200,"said”, replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor’s body","Metamorphosis"
"32439",5200,"another shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor.","Metamorphosis"
"32440",5200,"Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but","Metamorphosis"
"32441",5200,"did not complete it. “Now then”, said Mr. Samsa, “let’s give thanks to","Metamorphosis"
"32442",5200,"God for that”. He crossed himself, and the three women followed his","Metamorphosis"
"32443",5200,"example. Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: “Just","Metamorphosis"
"32444",5200,"look how thin he was. He didn’t eat anything for so long. The food came","Metamorphosis"
"32445",5200,"out again just the same as when it went in”. Gregor’s body was indeed","Metamorphosis"
"32446",5200,"completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now","Metamorphosis"
"32447",5200,"he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make","Metamorphosis"

"32449",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32450",5200,"“Grete, come with us in here for a little while”, said Mrs. Samsa with","Metamorphosis"
"32451",5200,"a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not","Metamorphosis"
"32452",5200,"without looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened","Metamorphosis"
"32453",5200,"the window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh","Metamorphosis"
"32454",5200,"air had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of","Metamorphosis"

"32456",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32457",5200,"The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in","Metamorphosis"
"32458",5200,"amazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. “Where","Metamorphosis"
"32459",5200,"is our breakfast?”, the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably.","Metamorphosis"
"32460",5200,"She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to","Metamorphosis"
"32461",5200,"the men that they might like to come into Gregor’s room. They did so,","Metamorphosis"
"32462",5200,"and stood around Gregor’s corpse with their hands in the pockets of","Metamorphosis"
"32463",5200,"their well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room.","Metamorphosis"
"32464",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32465",5200,"Then the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his","Metamorphosis"
"32466",5200,"uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of","Metamorphosis"
"32467",5200,"them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her face","Metamorphosis"
"32468",5200,"against her father’s arm.","Metamorphosis"

"32470",5200,"“Leave my home. Now!”, said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and without","Metamorphosis"
"32471",5200,"letting the women from him. “What do you mean?”, asked the middle of","Metamorphosis"
"32472",5200,"the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly. The","Metamorphosis"
"32473",5200,"other two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed","Metamorphosis"
"32474",5200,"them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could","Metamorphosis"
"32475",5200,"only end in their favour. “I mean just what I said”, answered Mr.","Metamorphosis"
"32476",5200,"Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards","Metamorphosis"
"32477",5200,"the man. At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if","Metamorphosis"
"32478",5200,"the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new","Metamorphosis"
"32479",5200,"positions. “Alright, we’ll go then”, he said, and looked up at Mr.","Metamorphosis"
"32480",5200,"Samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted","Metamorphosis"
"32481",5200,"permission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision. Mr. Samsa merely","Metamorphosis"
"32482",5200,"opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times. At that,","Metamorphosis"
"32483",5200,"and without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the","Metamorphosis"
"32484",5200,"front hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some","Metamorphosis"
"32485",5200,"time before and had been listening to what was being said. Now they","Metamorphosis"
"32486",5200,"jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr.","Metamorphosis"
"32487",5200,"Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the","Metamorphosis"
"32488",5200,"connection with their leader. Once there, all three took their hats","Metamorphosis"
"32489",5200,"from the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a word","Metamorphosis"
"32490",5200,"and left the premises. Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out","Metamorphosis"
"32491",5200,"onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men’s","Metamorphosis"
"32492",5200,"intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three","Metamorphosis"
"32493",5200,"gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As they","Metamorphosis"
"32494",5200,"turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a","Metamorphosis"
"32495",5200,"few moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa","Metamorphosis"
"32496",5200,"family lost interest in them; when a butcher’s boy, proud of posture","Metamorphosis"
"32497",5200,"with his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer","Metamorphosis"
"32498",5200,"than they were, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and","Metamorphosis"
"32499",5200,"went, as if relieved, back into the flat.","Metamorphosis"
"32500",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32501",5200,"They decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation","Metamorphosis"
"32502",5200,"and to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but","Metamorphosis"
"32503",5200,"they were in serious need of it. So they sat at the table and wrote","Metamorphosis"
"32504",5200,"three letters of excusal, Mr. Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her","Metamorphosis"
"32505",5200,"contractor and Grete to her principal. The cleaner came in while they","Metamorphosis"
"32506",5200,"were writing to tell them she was going, she’d finished her work for","Metamorphosis"
"32507",5200,"that morning. The three of them at first just nodded without looking up","Metamorphosis"
"32508",5200,"from what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did","Metamorphosis"
"32509",5200,"not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. “Well?”,","Metamorphosis"
"32510",5200,"asked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her","Metamorphosis"
"32511",5200,"face as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only","Metamorphosis"
"32512",5200,"do it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich","Metamorphosis"
"32513",5200,"feather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa","Metamorphosis"
"32514",5200,"all the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all","Metamorphosis"
"32515",5200,"directions. “What is it you want then?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the","Metamorphosis"
"32516",5200,"cleaner had the most respect for. “Yes”, she answered, and broke into a","Metamorphosis"
"32517",5200,"friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, “well then,","Metamorphosis"
"32518",5200,"that thing in there, you needn’t worry about how you’re going to get","Metamorphosis"
"32519",5200,"rid of it. That’s all been sorted out.” Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down","Metamorphosis"
"32520",5200,"over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were","Metamorphosis"
"32521",5200,"writing; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing","Metamorphosis"
"32522",5200,"everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite","Metamorphosis"
"32523",5200,"clear that she was not to. So, as she was prevented from telling them","Metamorphosis"
"32524",5200,"all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and,","Metamorphosis"
"32525",5200,"clearly peeved, called out “Cheerio then, everyone”, turned round","Metamorphosis"
"32526",5200,"sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.","Metamorphosis"
"32527",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32528",5200,"“Tonight she gets sacked”, said Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply","Metamorphosis"
"32529",5200,"from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have","Metamorphosis"
"32530",5200,"destroyed the peace they had only just gained. They got up and went","Metamorphosis"
"32531",5200,"over to the window where they remained with their arms around each","Metamorphosis"
"32532",5200,"other. Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat","Metamorphosis"
"32533",5200,"there watching for a while. Then he called out: “Come here, then. Let’s","Metamorphosis"
"32534",5200,"forget about all that old stuff, shall we. Come and give me a bit of","Metamorphosis"
"32535",5200,"attention”. The two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to","Metamorphosis"
"32536",5200,"him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished","Metamorphosis"
"32537",5200,"their letters.","Metamorphosis"
"32538",5200,"","Metamorphosis"
"32539",5200,"After that, the three of them left the flat together, which was","Metamorphosis"
"32540",5200,"something they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the","Metamorphosis"
"32541",5200,"open country outside the town. They had the tram, filled with warm","Metamorphosis"
"32542",5200,"sunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on their seats,","Metamorphosis"
"32543",5200,"they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination","Metamorphosis"
"32544",5200,"they were not at all bad—until then they had never asked each other","Metamorphosis"
"32545",5200,"about their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held","Metamorphosis"
"32546",5200,"particularly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement for","Metamorphosis"
"32547",5200,"the time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving","Metamorphosis"
"32548",5200,"house; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper","Metamorphosis"
"32549",5200,"than the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a","Metamorphosis"
"32550",5200,"better location and, most of all, more practical. All the time, Grete","Metamorphosis"
"32551",5200,"was becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late","Metamorphosis"
"32552",5200,"her cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs.","Metamorphosis"
"32553",5200,"Samsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their","Metamorphosis"

"32555",5200,"They became quieter. Just from each other’s glance and almost without","Metamorphosis"

"32689",7849,"Grubach was his landlady&mdash;but today she didn't come. That had never","The Trial"

"32693",7849,"disconcerted, rang the bell. There was immediately a knock at the door","The Trial"
"32694",7849,"and a man entered. He had never seen the man in this house before. He","The Trial"
"32695",7849,"was slim but firmly built, his clothes were black and close-fitting,","The Trial"
"32696",7849,"with many folds and pockets, buckles and buttons and a belt, all of","The Trial"
"32697",7849,"which gave the impression of being very practical but without making it","The Trial"
"32698",7849,"very clear what they were actually for. ""Who are you?"" asked K., sitting","The Trial"
"32699",7849,"half upright in his bed. The man, however, ignored the question as if","The Trial"
"32700",7849,"his arrival simply had to be accepted, and merely replied, ""You rang?""","The Trial"
"32701",7849,"""Anna should have brought me my breakfast,"" said K. He tried to work","The Trial"
"32702",7849,"out who the man actually was, first in silence, just through","The Trial"
"32703",7849,"observation and by thinking about it, but the man didn't stay still to","The Trial"
"32704",7849,"be looked at for very long. Instead he went over to the door, opened it","The Trial"
"32705",7849,"slightly, and said to someone who was clearly standing immediately","The Trial"
"32706",7849,"behind it, ""He","The Trial"
"32707",7849,"wants Anna to bring him his breakfast."" There was a little laughter in","The Trial"
"32708",7849,"the neighbouring room, it was not clear from the sound of it whether","The Trial"
"32709",7849,"there were several people laughing. The strange man could not have","The Trial"
"32710",7849,"learned anything from it that he hadn't known already, but now he said","The Trial"
"32711",7849,"to K., as if making his report ""It is not possible."" ""It would be the","The Trial"
"32712",7849,"first time that's happened,"" said K., as he jumped out of bed and","The Trial"
"32713",7849,"quickly pulled on his trousers. ""I want to see who that is in the next","The Trial"
"32714",7849,"room, and why it is that Mrs. Grubach has let me be disturbed in this","The Trial"
"32715",7849,"way."" It immediately occurred to him that he needn't have said this out","The Trial"
"32716",7849,"loud, and that he must to some extent have acknowledged their authority","The Trial"
"32717",7849,"by doing so, but that didn't seem important to him at the time. That, at","The Trial"
"32718",7849,"least, is how the stranger took it, as he said, ""Don't you think you'd","The Trial"
"32719",7849,"better stay where you are?"" ""I want neither to stay here nor to be","The Trial"
"32720",7849,"spoken to by you until you've introduced yourself."" ""I meant it for your","The Trial"
"32721",7849,"own good,"" said the stranger and opened the door, this time without","The Trial"
"32722",7849,"being asked. The next room, which K. entered more slowly than he had","The Trial"
"32723",7849,"intended, looked at first glance exactly the same as it had the previous","The Trial"
"32724",7849,"evening. It was Mrs. Grubach's living room, over-filled with furniture,","The Trial"
"32725",7849,"tablecloths, porcelain and photographs. Perhaps there was a little more","The Trial"
"32726",7849,"space in there than usual today, but if so it was not immediately","The Trial"
"32727",7849,"obvious, especially as the main difference was the presence of a man","The Trial"
"32728",7849,"sitting by the open window with a book from which he now looked up.","The Trial"
"32729",7849,"""You should have stayed in your room! Didn't Franz tell you?"" ""And what","The Trial"
"32730",7849,"is it you want, then?"" said K., looking back and forth between this new","The Trial"
"32731",7849,"acquaintance and the one named Franz, who had remained in the doorway.","The Trial"
"32732",7849,"Through the open window he noticed the old woman again, who had come","The Trial"
"32733",7849,"close to the window opposite so that she could continue to see","The Trial"
"32734",7849,"everything. She was showing an inquisitiveness that really made it seem","The Trial"
"32735",7849,"like she was going senile. ""I want to see Mrs. Grubach ...,"" said K.,","The Trial"
"32736",7849,"making a movement as if tearing himself away from the two men&mdash;even","The Trial"
"32737",7849,"though they were standing well away from him&mdash;and wanted to go. ""No,""","The Trial"
"32738",7849,"said the man at the window, who threw his book down on a coffee table","The Trial"
"32739",7849,"and stood up. ""You can't go away when you're under arrest."" ""That's how","The Trial"
"32740",7849,"it seems,"" said K. ""And why am I under arrest?"" he then asked. ""That's","The Trial"
"32741",7849,"something we're not allowed to tell you. Go into your room and wait","The Trial"
"32742",7849,"there. Proceedings are underway and you'll learn about everything all in","The Trial"
"32743",7849,"good time. It's not really part of my job to be friendly towards you","The Trial"
"32744",7849,"like this, but I hope no-one, apart from Franz, will hear about it, and","The Trial"
"32745",7849,"he's been more friendly towards you than he should have been, under the","The Trial"
"32746",7849,"rules, himself. If you carry on having as much good luck as you have","The Trial"
"32747",7849,"been with your arresting officers then you can reckon on things going","The Trial"
"32748",7849,"well with you."" K. wanted to sit down, but then he saw that, apart from","The Trial"
"32749",7849,"the chair by the window, there was nowhere anywhere in the room where he","The Trial"
"32750",7849,"could sit. ""You'll get the chance to see for yourself how true all this","The Trial"
"32751",7849,"is,"" said Franz and both men then walked up to K. They were","The Trial"
"32752",7849,"significantly bigger than him, especially the second man, who frequently","The Trial"
"32753",7849,"slapped him on the shoulder. The two of them felt K.'s nightshirt, and","The Trial"
"32754",7849,"said he would now have to wear one that was of much lower quality, but","The Trial"
"32755",7849,"that they would keep the nightshirt along with his other underclothes","The Trial"
"32756",7849,"and return them to him if his case turned out well. ""It's better for you","The Trial"
"32757",7849,"if you give us the things than if you leave them in the storeroom,"" they","The Trial"
"32758",7849,"said. ""Things have a tendency to go missing in the storeroom, and after","The Trial"
"32759",7849,"a certain amount of time they sell things off, whether the case involved","The Trial"
"32760",7849,"has come to an end or not. And cases like this can last a long time,","The Trial"
"32761",7849,"especially the ones that have been coming up lately. They'd give you the","The Trial"
"32762",7849,"money they got for them, but it wouldn't be very much as it's not what","The Trial"
"32763",7849,"they're offered for them when they sell them that counts, it's how much","The Trial"
"32764",7849,"they get slipped on the side, and things like that lose their value","The Trial"
"32765",7849,"anyway when they get passed on from hand to hand, year after year."" K.","The Trial"
"32766",7849,"paid hardly any attention to what they were saying, he did not place","The Trial"
"32767",7849,"much value on what he may have still possessed or on who decided what","The Trial"
"32768",7849,"happened to them. It was much more important to him to get a clear","The Trial"
"32769",7849,"understanding of his position, but he could not think clearly while","The Trial"
"32770",7849,"these people were here, the second policeman's belly&mdash;and they could","The Trial"
"32771",7849,"only be policemen&mdash;looked friendly enough, sticking out towards him, but","The Trial"
"32772",7849,"when K. looked up and saw his dry, bony face it did not seem to fit","The Trial"
"32773",7849,"with the body. His strong nose twisted to one side as if ignoring K. and","The Trial"
"32774",7849,"sharing an understanding with the other policeman. What sort of people","The Trial"
"32775",7849,"were these? What were they talking about? What office did they belong","The Trial"
"32776",7849,"to? K. was living in a free country, after all, everywhere was at peace,","The Trial"
"32777",7849,"all laws were decent and were upheld, who was it who dared accost him in","The Trial"
"32778",7849,"his own home. He was always inclined to take life as lightly as he","The Trial"
"32779",7849,"could, to cross bridges when he came to them, pay no heed for the","The Trial"
"32780",7849,"future, even when everything seemed under threat. But here that did not","The Trial"
"32781",7849,"seem the right thing to do. He could have taken it all as a joke, a big","The Trial"
"32782",7849,"joke set up by his colleagues at the bank for some unknown reason, or","The Trial"
"32783",7849,"also perhaps because today was his thirtieth birthday, it was all","The Trial"
"32784",7849,"possible of course, maybe all he had to do was laugh in the policemen's","The Trial"
"32785",7849,"face in some way and they would laugh with him, maybe they were","The Trial"
"32786",7849,"tradesmen from the corner of the street, they looked like they might","The Trial"
"32787",7849,"be&mdash;but he was nonetheless determined, ever since he first caught sight","The Trial"
"32788",7849,"of the one called Franz, not to lose any slight advantage he might have","The Trial"
"32789",7849,"had over these people. There was a very slight risk that people would","The Trial"
"32790",7849,"later say he couldn't understand a joke, but&mdash;although he wasn't","The Trial"
"32791",7849,"normally in the habit of learning from experience&mdash;he might also have","The Trial"
"32792",7849,"had a few unimportant occasions in mind when, unlike his more cautious","The Trial"
"32793",7849,"friends, he had acted with no thought at all for what might follow and","The Trial"
"32794",7849,"had been made to suffer for it. He didn't want that to happen again, not","The Trial"
"32795",7849,"this time at least; if they were play-acting he would act along with","The Trial"
"32796",7849,"them.</p>","The Trial"
"32797",7849,"","The Trial"
"32798",7849,"<p>He still had time. ""Allow me,"" he said, and hurried between the two","The Trial"
"32799",7849,"policemen through into his room. ""He seems sensible enough,"" he heard","The Trial"
"32800",7849,"them say behind him. Once in his room, he quickly pulled open the drawer","The Trial"
"32801",7849,"of his writing desk, everything in it was very tidy but in his","The Trial"
"32802",7849,"agitation he was unable to find the identification documents he was","The Trial"
"32803",7849,"looking for straight away. He finally found his bicycle permit and was","The Trial"
"32804",7849,"about to go back to the policemen with it when it seemed to him too","The Trial"
"32805",7849,"petty, so he carried on searching until he found his birth certificate.","The Trial"
"32806",7849,"Just as he got back in the adjoining room the door on the other side","The Trial"
"32807",7849,"opened and Mrs. Grubach was about to enter. He only saw her for an","The Trial"
"32808",7849,"instant, for as soon as she recognised K. she was clearly embarrassed,","The Trial"
"32809",7849,"asked for forgiveness and disappeared, closing the door behind her very","The Trial"
"32810",7849,"carefully. ""Do come in,"" K. could have said just then. But now he stood","The Trial"
"32811",7849,"in the middle of the room with his papers in his hand and still looking","The Trial"
"32812",7849,"at the door which did not open again. He stayed like that until he was","The Trial"
"32813",7849,"startled out of it by the shout of the policeman who sat at the little","The Trial"
"32814",7849,"table at the open window and, as K. now saw, was eating his breakfast.","The Trial"
"32815",7849,"""Why didn't she come in?"" he asked. ""She's not allowed to,"" said the","The Trial"
"32816",7849,"big policeman. ""You're under arrest, aren't you?"" ""But how can I be","The Trial"
"32817",7849,"under arrest? And how come it's like this?"" ""Now you're starting again,""","The Trial"
"32818",7849,"said the policeman, dipping a piece of buttered bread in the honeypot.","The Trial"
"32819",7849,"""We don't answer questions like that."" ""You will have to answer them,""","The Trial"
"32820",7849,"said K. ""Here are my identification papers, now show me yours and I","The Trial"
"32821",7849,"certainly want to see the arrest warrant."" ""Oh, my God!"" said the","The Trial"
"32822",7849,"policeman. ""In a position like yours, and you think you can start giving","The Trial"
"32823",7849,"orders, do you. It won't do you any good to get us on the wrong side,","The Trial"
"32824",7849,"even if you think it will&mdash;we're probably more on your side that anyone","The Trial"
"32825",7849,"else you know!"" ""That's true, you know, you'd better believe it,"" said","The Trial"
"32826",7849,"Franz, holding a cup of coffee in his hand which he did not lift to his","The Trial"
"32827",7849,"mouth but looked at K. in a way that was probably meant to be full of","The Trial"
"32828",7849,"meaning but could not actually be understood. K. found himself, without","The Trial"
"32829",7849,"intending it, in a mute dialogue with Franz, but then slapped his hand","The Trial"
"32830",7849,"down on his papers and said, ""Here are my identity documents."" ""And what","The Trial"
"32831",7849,"do you want us to do about it?"" replied the big policeman, loudly. ""The","The Trial"
"32832",7849,"way you're carrying on, it's worse than a child. What is it you want? Do","The Trial"
"32833",7849,"you want to get this great, bloody trial of yours over with quickly by","The Trial"
"32834",7849,"talking about ID and arrest warrants with us? We're just coppers, that's","The Trial"
"32835",7849,"all we are. Junior officers like us hardly know one end of an ID card","The Trial"
"32836",7849,"from another, all we've got to do with you is keep an eye on you for","The Trial"
"32837",7849,"ten hours a day and get paid for it. That's all we are. Mind you, what","The Trial"
"32838",7849,"we can do is make sure that the high officials we work for find out","The Trial"
"32839",7849,"just what sort of person it is they're going to arrest, and why he","The Trial"
"32840",7849,"should be arrested, before they issue the warrant. There's no mistake","The Trial"
"32841",7849,"there. Our authorities as far as I know, and I only know the lowest","The Trial"
"32842",7849,"grades, don't go out looking for guilt among the public; it's the guilt","The Trial"
"32843",7849,"that draws them out, like it says in the law, and they have to send us","The Trial"
"32844",7849,"police officers out. That's the law. Where d'you think there'd be any","The Trial"
"32845",7849,"mistake there?"" ""I don't know this law,"" said K. ""So much the worse for","The Trial"
"32846",7849,"you, then,"" said the policeman. ""It's probably exists only in your","The Trial"
"32847",7849,"heads,"" said K., he wanted, in some way, to insinuate his way into the","The Trial"
"32848",7849,"thoughts of the policemen, to re-shape those thoughts to his benefit or","The Trial"
"32849",7849,"to make himself at home there. But the policeman just said dismissively,","The Trial"
"32850",7849,"""You'll find out when it affects you."" Franz joined in, and said, ""Look","The Trial"
"32851",7849,"at this, Willem, he admits he doesn't know the law and at the same time","The Trial"
"32852",7849,"insists he's innocent."" ""You're quite right, but we can't get him to","The Trial"
"32853",7849,"understand a thing,"" said the other. K. stopped talking with them; do I,","The Trial"
"32854",7849,"he thought to himself, do I really have to carry on getting tangled up","The Trial"
"32855",7849,"with the chattering of base functionaries like this?&mdash;and they admit","The Trial"
"32856",7849,"themselves that they are of the lowest position. They're talking about","The Trial"
"32857",7849,"things of which they don't have the slightest understanding, anyway.","The Trial"
"32858",7849,"It's only because of their stupidity that they're able to be so sure of","The Trial"
"32859",7849,"themselves. I just need few words with someone of the same social","The Trial"
"32860",7849,"standing as myself and everything will be incomparably clearer, much","The Trial"
"32861",7849,"clearer than a long conversation with these two can make it. He walked","The Trial"
"32862",7849,"up and down the free space in the room a couple of times, across the","The Trial"
"32863",7849,"street he could see the old woman who, now, had pulled an old man, much","The Trial"
"32864",7849,"older than herself, up to the window and had her arms around him. K. had","The Trial"
"32865",7849,"to put an end to this display, ""Take me to your superior,"" he said. ""As","The Trial"
"32866",7849,"soon as he wants to see you. Not before,"" said the policeman, the one","The Trial"
"32867",7849,"called Willem. ""And now my advice to you,"" he added, ""is to go into your","The Trial"
"32868",7849,"room, stay calm, and wait and see what's to be done with you. If you","The Trial"
"32869",7849,"take our advice, you won't tire yourself out thinking about things to no","The Trial"
"32870",7849,"purpose, you need to pull yourself together as there's a lot that's","The Trial"
"32871",7849,"going to required of you. You've not behaved towards us the way we","The Trial"
"32872",7849,"deserve after being so good to you, you forget that we, whatever we are,","The Trial"
"32873",7849,"we're still free men and you're not, and that's quite an advantage. But","The Trial"
"32874",7849,"in spite of all that we're still willing, if you've got the money, to go","The Trial"

"32876",7849,"","The Trial"
"32877",7849,"<p>Without giving any answer to this offer, K. stood still for some time.","The Trial"
"32878",7849,"Perhaps, if he opened the door of the next room or even the front door,","The Trial"
"32879",7849,"the two of them would not dare to stand in his way, perhaps that would","The Trial"
"32880",7849,"be the simplest way to settle the whole thing, by bringing it to a head.","The Trial"
"32881",7849,"But maybe they would grab him, and if he were thrown down on the ground","The Trial"
"32882",7849,"he would lose all the advantage he, in a certain respect, had over them.","The Trial"
"32883",7849,"So he decided on the more certain solution, the way things would go in","The Trial"

"32889",7849,"breakfast. Now it was all the breakfast he had and anyway, as he","The Trial"
"32890",7849,"confirmed as soon as he took his first, big bite of it, it was far","The Trial"
"32891",7849,"better than a breakfast he could have had through the good will of the","The Trial"
"32892",7849,"policemen from the dirty café. He felt well and confident, he had failed","The Trial"
"32893",7849,"to go into work at the bank this morning but that could easily be","The Trial"
"32894",7849,"excused because of the relatively high position he held there. Should he","The Trial"
"32895",7849,"really send in his explanation? He wondered about it. If nobody believed","The Trial"
"32896",7849,"him, and in this case that would be understandable, he could bring Mrs.","The Trial"
"32897",7849,"Grubach in as a witness, or even the old pair from across the street,","The Trial"
"32898",7849,"who probably even now were on their way over to the window opposite. It","The Trial"
"32899",7849,"puzzled K., at least it puzzled him looking at it from the policemen's","The Trial"
"32900",7849,"point of view, that they had made him go into the room and left him","The Trial"
"32901",7849,"alone there, where he had ten different ways of killing himself. At the","The Trial"
"32902",7849,"same time, though, he asked himself, this time looking at it from his","The Trial"
"32903",7849,"own point of view, what reason he could have to do so. Because those two","The Trial"
"32904",7849,"were sitting there in the next room and had taken his breakfast,","The Trial"
"32905",7849,"perhaps. It would have been so pointless to kill himself that, even if","The Trial"
"32906",7849,"he had wanted to, the pointlessness would have made him unable. Maybe,","The Trial"
"32907",7849,"if the policemen had not been so obviously limited in their mental","The Trial"
"32908",7849,"abilities, it could have been supposed that they had come to the same","The Trial"
"32909",7849,"conclusion and saw no danger in leaving him alone because of it. They","The Trial"
"32910",7849,"could watch now, if they wanted, and see how he went over to the","The Trial"
"32911",7849,"cupboard in the wall where he kept a bottle of good schnapps, how he","The Trial"
"32912",7849,"first emptied a glass of it in place of his breakfast and how he then","The Trial"
"32913",7849,"took a second glassful in order to give himself courage, the last one","The Trial"
"32914",7849,"just as a precaution for the unlikely chance it would be needed.</p>","The Trial"
"32915",7849,"","The Trial"
"32916",7849,"<p>Then he was so startled by a shout to him from the other room that he","The Trial"
"32917",7849,"struck his teeth against the glass. ""The supervisor wants to see you!"" a","The Trial"
"32918",7849,"voice said. It was only the shout that startled him, this curt, abrupt,","The Trial"
"32919",7849,"military shout, that he would not have expected from the policeman","The Trial"
"32920",7849,"called Franz. In itself, he found the order very welcome. ""At last!"" he","The Trial"
"32921",7849,"called back, locked the cupboard and, without delay, hurried into the","The Trial"
"32922",7849,"next room. The two policemen were standing there and chased him back","The Trial"
"32923",7849,"into his bedroom as if that were a matter of course. ""What d'you think","The Trial"
"32924",7849,"you're doing?"" they cried. ""Think you're going to see the supervisor","The Trial"
"32925",7849,"dressed in just your shirt, do you? He'd see to it you got a right","The Trial"
"32926",7849,"thumping, and us and all!"" ""Let go of me for God's sake!"" called K., who","The Trial"
"32927",7849,"had already been pushed back as far as his wardrobe, ""if you accost me","The Trial"
"32928",7849,"when I'm still in bed you can't expect to find me in my evening dress.""","The Trial"
"32929",7849,"""That won't help you,"" said the policemen, who always became very quiet,","The Trial"
"32930",7849,"almost sad, when K. began to shout, and in that way confused him or, to","The Trial"
"32931",7849,"some extent, brought him to his senses. ""Ridiculous formalities!"" he","The Trial"
"32932",7849,"grumbled, as he lifted his coat from the chair and kept it in both his","The Trial"
"32933",7849,"hands for a little while, as if holding it out for the policemen's","The Trial"
"32934",7849,"inspection. They shook their heads. ""It's got to be a black coat,""","The Trial"
"32935",7849,"they said. At that, K. threw the coat to the floor and said&mdash;without","The Trial"
"32936",7849,"knowing even himself what he meant by it&mdash;""Well it's not going to be the","The Trial"
"32937",7849,"main trial, after all."" The policemen laughed, but continued to insist,","The Trial"
"32938",7849,"""It's got to be a black coat."" ""Well that's alright by me if it makes","The Trial"
"32939",7849,"things go any faster,"" said K. He opened the wardrobe himself, spent a","The Trial"
"32940",7849,"long time searching through all the clothes, and chose his best black","The Trial"
"32941",7849,"suit which had a short jacket that had greatly surprised those who knew","The Trial"
"32942",7849,"him, then he also pulled out a fresh shirt and began, carefully, to get","The Trial"
"32943",7849,"dressed. He secretly told himself that he had succeeded in speeding","The Trial"
"32944",7849,"things up by letting the policemen forget to make him have a bath. He","The Trial"
"32945",7849,"watched them to see if they might remember after all, but of course it","The Trial"
"32946",7849,"never occurred to them, although Willem did not forget to send Franz up","The Trial"
"32947",7849,"to the supervisor with the message saying that K. was getting dressed.</p>","The Trial"
"32948",7849,"","The Trial"
"32949",7849,"<p>Once he was properly dressed, K. had to pass by Willem as he went","The Trial"
"32950",7849,"through the next room into the one beyond, the door of which was already","The Trial"
"32951",7849,"wide open. K. knew very well that this room had recently been let to a","The Trial"
"32952",7849,"typist called 'Miss Bürstner'. She was in the habit of going out to work","The Trial"
"32953",7849,"very early and coming back home very late, and K. had never exchanged","The Trial"
"32954",7849,"more than a few words of greeting with her. Now, her bedside table had","The Trial"
"32955",7849,"been pulled into the middle of the room to be used as a desk for these","The Trial"
"32956",7849,"proceedings, and the supervisor sat behind it. He had his legs crossed,","The Trial"
"32957",7849,"and had thrown one arm over the backrest of the chair.</p>","The Trial"
"32958",7849,"","The Trial"
"32959",7849,"<p>In one corner of the room there were three young people looking at the","The Trial"
"32960",7849,"photographs belonging to Miss Bürstner that had been put into a piece of","The Trial"
"32961",7849,"fabric on the wall. Hung up on the handle of the open window was a white","The Trial"
"32962",7849,"blouse. At the window across the street, there was the old pair again,","The Trial"
"32963",7849,"although now their number had increased, as behind them, and far taller","The Trial"
"32964",7849,"than they were, stood a man with an open shirt that showed his chest and","The Trial"
"32965",7849,"a reddish goatee beard which he squeezed and twisted with his fingers.","The Trial"
"32966",7849,"""Josef K.?"" asked the supervisor, perhaps merely to attract K.'s","The Trial"
"32967",7849,"attention as he looked round the room. K. nodded. ""I daresay you were","The Trial"
"32968",7849,"quite surprised by all that's been taking place this morning,"" said the","The Trial"
"32969",7849,"supervisor as, with both hands, he pushed away the few items on the","The Trial"
"32970",7849,"bedside table&mdash;the candle and box of matches, a book and a pin cushion","The Trial"
"32971",7849,"which lay there as if they were things he would need for his own","The Trial"
"32972",7849,"business. ""Certainly,"" said K., and he began to feel relaxed now that,","The Trial"
"32973",7849,"at last, he stood in front of someone with some sense, someone with whom","The Trial"
"32974",7849,"he would be able to talk about his situation. ""Certainly I'm surprised,","The Trial"
"32975",7849,"but I'm not in any way very surprised."" ""You're not very surprised?""","The Trial"
"32976",7849,"asked the supervisor, as he positioned the candle in the middle of the","The Trial"
"32977",7849,"table and the other things in a group around it. ""Perhaps you don't","The Trial"
"32978",7849,"quite understand me,"" K. hurriedly pointed out. ""What I mean is ...""","The Trial"
"32979",7849,"here K. broke off what he was saying and looked round for somewhere to","The Trial"
"32980",7849,"sit. ""I may sit down, mayn't I?"" he asked. ""That's not usual,"" the","The Trial"
"32981",7849,"supervisor answered. ""What I mean is ...,"" said K. without delaying a","The Trial"
"32982",7849,"second time, ""that, yes, I am very surprised but when you've been in the","The Trial"
"32983",7849,"world for thirty years already and had to make your own way through","The Trial"
"32984",7849,"everything yourself, which has been my lot, then you become hardened to","The Trial"
"32985",7849,"surprises and don't take them too hard. Especially not what's happened","The Trial"
"32986",7849,"today."" ""Why especially not what's happened today?"" ""I wouldn't want to","The Trial"
"32987",7849,"say that I see all of this as a joke, you seem to have gone to too much","The Trial"
"32988",7849,"trouble making all these arrangements for that. Everyone in the house","The Trial"
"32989",7849,"must be taking part in it as well as all of you, that would be going","The Trial"
"32990",7849,"beyond what could be a joke. So I don't want to say that this is a","The Trial"
"32991",7849,"joke."" ""Quite right,"" said the supervisor, looking to see how many","The Trial"
"32992",7849,"matches were left in the box. ""But on the other hand,"" K. went on,","The Trial"
"32993",7849,"looking round at everyone there and even wishing he could get the","The Trial"
"32994",7849,"attention of the three who were looking at the photographs, ""on the","The Trial"
"32995",7849,"other hand this really can't be all that important. That follows from","The Trial"
"32996",7849,"the fact that I've been indicted, but can't think of the slightest","The Trial"
"32997",7849,"offence for which I could be indicted. But even that is all beside the","The Trial"
"32998",7849,"point, the main question is: Who is issuing the indictment? What office","The Trial"
"32999",7849,"is conducting this affair? Are you officials? None of you is wearing a","The Trial"
"33000",7849,"uniform, unless what you are wearing""&mdash;here he turned towards Franz&mdash;""is","The Trial"
"33001",7849,"meant to be a uniform, it's actually more of a travelling suit. I","The Trial"
"33002",7849,"require a clear answer to all these questions, and I'm quite sure that","The Trial"
"33003",7849,"once things have been made clear we can take our leave of each other on","The Trial"
"33004",7849,"the best of terms."" The supervisor slammed the box of matches down on","The Trial"
"33005",7849,"the table. ""You're making a big mistake,"" he said. ""These gentlemen and","The Trial"
"33006",7849,"I have got nothing to do with your business, in fact we know almost","The Trial"
"33007",7849,"nothing about you. We could be wearing uniforms as proper and exact as","The Trial"
"33008",7849,"you like and your situation wouldn't be any the worse for it. As to","The Trial"
"33009",7849,"whether you're on a charge, I can't give you any sort of clear answer to","The Trial"
"33010",7849,"that, I don't even know whether you are or not. You're under arrest,","The Trial"
"33011",7849,"you're quite right about that, but I don't know any more than that.","The Trial"
"33012",7849,"Maybe these officers have been chit-chatting with you, well if they have","The Trial"
"33013",7849,"that's all it is, chit-chat. I can't give you an answer to your","The Trial"
"33014",7849,"questions, but I can give you a bit of advice: You'd better think less","The Trial"
"33015",7849,"about us and what's going to happen to you, and think a bit more about","The Trial"
"33016",7849,"yourself. And stop making all this fuss about your sense of innocence;","The Trial"
"33017",7849,"you don't make such a bad impression, but with all this fuss you're","The Trial"
"33018",7849,"damaging it. And you ought to do a bit less talking, too. Almost","The Trial"
"33019",7849,"everything you've said so far has been things we could have taken from","The Trial"
"33020",7849,"your behaviour, even if you'd said no more than a few words. And what","The Trial"
"33021",7849,"you have said has not exactly been in your favour.""</p>","The Trial"
"33022",7849,"","The Trial"
"33023",7849,"<p>K. stared at the supervisor. Was this man, probably younger than he was,","The Trial"
"33024",7849,"lecturing him like a schoolmaster. Was he being punished for his honesty","The Trial"
"33025",7849,"with a telling off. And was he to learn nothing about the reasons for","The Trial"
"33026",7849,"his arrest or those who were arresting him. He became somewhat cross and","The Trial"
"33027",7849,"began to walk up and down. No-one stopped him doing this and he pushed","The Trial"
"33028",7849,"his sleeves back, felt his chest, straightened his hair, went over to","The Trial"
"33029",7849,"the three men, said, ""It makes no sense,"" at which these three turned","The Trial"
"33030",7849,"round to face him and came towards him with serious expressions. He","The Trial"
"33031",7849,"finally came again to a halt in front of the supervisor's desk. ""State","The Trial"
"33032",7849,"Attorney Hasterer is a good friend of mine,"" he said, ""can I telephone","The Trial"
"33033",7849,"him?"" ""Certainly,"" said the supervisor, ""but I don't know what the point","The Trial"
"33034",7849,"of that will be, I suppose you must have some private matter you want to","The Trial"
"33035",7849,"discuss with him."" ""What the point is?"" shouted K., more disconcerted","The Trial"
"33036",7849,"that cross. ""Who do you think you are? You want to see some point in it","The Trial"
"33037",7849,"while you're carrying out something as pointless as it could be. It's","The Trial"
"33038",7849,"enough to make you cry! These gentlemen first accost me, and now they","The Trial"
"33039",7849,"sit or stand about in here and let me be hauled up in front of you.","The Trial"
"33040",7849,"What point there would be, in telephoning a state attorney when I'm","The Trial"
"33041",7849,"ostensibly under arrest? Very well, I won't make the telephone call.""","The Trial"
"33042",7849,"""You can call him if you want to,"" said the supervisor, stretching his","The Trial"
"33043",7849,"hand out towards the outer room where the telephone was, ""please, go on,","The Trial"
"33044",7849,"do make your phone call."" ""No, I don't want to any more,"" said K., and","The Trial"
"33045",7849,"went over to the window. Across the street, the people were still there","The Trial"
"33046",7849,"at the window, and it was only now that K. had gone up to his window","The Trial"
"33047",7849,"that they seemed to become uneasy about quietly watching what was going","The Trial"
"33048",7849,"on. The old couple wanted to get up but the man behind them calmed them","The Trial"
"33049",7849,"down. ""We've got some kind of audience over there,"" called K. to the","The Trial"
"33050",7849,"supervisor, quite loudly, as he pointed out with his forefinger. ""Go","The Trial"
"33051",7849,"away,"" he then called across to them. And the three of them did","The Trial"
"33052",7849,"immediately retreat a few steps, the old pair even found themselves","The Trial"
"33053",7849,"behind the man who then concealed them with the breadth of his body and","The Trial"
"33054",7849,"seemed, going by the movements of his mouth, to be saying something","The Trial"
"33055",7849,"incomprehensible into the distance. They did not disappear entirely,","The Trial"
"33056",7849,"though, but seemed to be waiting for the moment when they could come","The Trial"
"33057",7849,"back to the window without being noticed. ""Intrusive, thoughtless","The Trial"
"33058",7849,"people!"" said K. as he turned back into the room. The supervisor may","The Trial"
"33059",7849,"have agreed with him, at least K. thought that was what he saw from the","The Trial"
"33060",7849,"corner of his eye. But it was just as possible that he had not even been","The Trial"
"33061",7849,"listening as he had his hand pressed firmly down on the table and seemed","The Trial"
"33062",7849,"to be comparing the length of his fingers. The two policemen were","The Trial"
"33063",7849,"sitting on a chest covered with a coloured blanket, rubbing their knees.","The Trial"
"33064",7849,"The three young people had put their hands on their hips and were","The Trial"
"33065",7849,"looking round aimlessly. Everything was still, like in some office that","The Trial"
"33066",7849,"has been forgotten about. ""Now, gentlemen,"" called out K., and for a","The Trial"
"33067",7849,"moment it seemed as if he was carrying all of them on his shoulders, ""it","The Trial"
"33068",7849,"looks like your business with me is over with. In my opinion, it's best","The Trial"
"33069",7849,"now to stop wondering about whether you're proceeding correctly or","The Trial"
"33070",7849,"incorrectly, and to bring the matter to a peaceful close with a mutual","The Trial"
"33071",7849,"handshake. If you are of the same opinion, then please...."" and he","The Trial"
"33072",7849,"walked up to the supervisor's desk and held out his hand to him. The","The Trial"
"33073",7849,"supervisor raised his eyes, bit his lip and looked at K.'s outstretched","The Trial"
"33074",7849,"hand; K. still believed the supervisor would do as he suggested. But","The Trial"
"33075",7849,"instead, he stood up, picked up a hard round hat that was laying on","The Trial"
"33076",7849,"Miss Bürstner's bed and put it carefully onto his head, using both hands","The Trial"
"33077",7849,"as if trying on a new hat. ""Everything seems so simple to you, doesn't","The Trial"
"33078",7849,"it,"" he said to K. as he did so, ""so you think we should bring the","The Trial"
"33079",7849,"matter to a peaceful close, do you? No, no, that won't do. Mind you, on","The Trial"
"33080",7849,"the other hand I certainly wouldn't want you to think there's no hope","The Trial"
"33081",7849,"for you. No, why should you think that? You're simply under arrest,","The Trial"
"33082",7849,"nothing more than that. That's what I had to tell you, that's what I've","The Trial"
"33083",7849,"done and now I've seen how you've taken it. That's enough for one day","The Trial"
"33084",7849,"and we can take our leave of each other, for the time being at least. I","The Trial"
"33085",7849,"expect you'll want to go in to the bank now, won't you?"" ""In to the","The Trial"
"33086",7849,"bank?"" asked K., ""I thought I was under arrest."" K. said this with a","The Trial"
"33087",7849,"certain amount of defiance as, although his handshake had not been","The Trial"
"33088",7849,"accepted, he was feeling more independent of all these people,","The Trial"
"33089",7849,"especially since the supervisor had stood up. He was playing with them.","The Trial"
"33090",7849,"If they left, he had decided he would run after them and offer to let","The Trial"
"33091",7849,"them arrest him. That's why he even repeated, ""How can I go in to the","The Trial"
"33092",7849,"bank when I'm under arrest?"" ""I see you've misunderstood me,"" said the","The Trial"
"33093",7849,"supervisor who was already at the door. ""It's true that you're under","The Trial"
"33094",7849,"arrest, but that shouldn't stop you from carrying out your job. And","The Trial"
"33095",7849,"there shouldn't be anything to stop you carrying on with your usual","The Trial"
"33096",7849,"life."" ""In that case it's not too bad, being under arrest,"" said K., and","The Trial"
"33097",7849,"went up close to the supervisor. ""I never meant it should be anything","The Trial"
"33098",7849,"else,"" he replied. ""It hardly seems to have been necessary to notify me","The Trial"
"33099",7849,"of the arrest in that case,"" said K., and went even closer. The others","The Trial"
"33100",7849,"had also come closer. All of them had gathered together into a narrow","The Trial"
"33101",7849,"space by the door. ""That was my duty,"" said the supervisor. ""A silly","The Trial"
"33102",7849,"duty,"" said K., unyielding. ""Maybe so,"" replied the supervisor, ""only","The Trial"
"33103",7849,"don't let's waste our time talking on like this. I had assumed you'd be","The Trial"
"33104",7849,"wanting to go to the bank. As you're paying close attention to every","The Trial"
"33105",7849,"word I'll add this: I'm not forcing you to go to the bank, I'd just","The Trial"
"33106",7849,"assumed you wanted to. And to make things easier for you, and to let you","The Trial"
"33107",7849,"get to the bank with as little fuss as possible I've put these three","The Trial"
"33108",7849,"gentlemen, colleagues of yours, at your disposal."" ""What's that?""","The Trial"
"33109",7849,"exclaimed K., and looked at the three in astonishment. He could only","The Trial"
"33110",7849,"remember seeing them in their group by the photographs, but these","The Trial"
"33111",7849,"characterless, anaemic young people were indeed officials from his bank,","The Trial"
"33112",7849,"not colleagues of his, that was putting it too high and it showed a gap","The Trial"
"33113",7849,"in the omniscience of the supervisor, but they were nonetheless junior","The Trial"
"33114",7849,"members of staff at the bank. How could K. have failed to see that? How","The Trial"
"33115",7849,"occupied he must have been with the supervisor and the policemen not to","The Trial"
"33116",7849,"have recognised these three! Rabensteiner, with his stiff demeanour and","The Trial"
"33117",7849,"swinging hands, Kullich, with his blonde hair and deep-set eyes, and","The Trial"
"33118",7849,"Kaminer, with his involuntary grin caused by chronic muscle spasms.","The Trial"
"33119",7849,"""Good morning,"" said K. after a while, extending his hand to the","The Trial"
"33120",7849,"gentlemen as they bowed correctly to him. ""I didn't recognise you at","The Trial"
"33121",7849,"all. So, we'll go into work now, shall we?"" The gentlemen laughed and","The Trial"
"33122",7849,"nodded enthusiastically, as if that was what they had been waiting for","The Trial"
"33123",7849,"all the time, except that K. had left his hat in his room so they all","The Trial"
"33124",7849,"dashed, one after another, into the room to fetch it, which caused a","The Trial"
"33125",7849,"certain amount of embarrassment. K. stood where he was and watched them","The Trial"
"33126",7849,"through the open double doorway, the last to go, of course, was the","The Trial"
"33127",7849,"apathetic Rabensteiner who had broken into no more than an elegant trot.","The Trial"
"33128",7849,"Kaminer got to the hat and K., as he often had to do at the bank,","The Trial"
"33129",7849,"forcibly reminded himself that the grin was not deliberate, that he in","The Trial"
"33130",7849,"fact wasn't able to grin deliberately. At that moment Mrs. Grubach","The Trial"
"33131",7849,"opened the door from the hallway into the living room where all the","The Trial"
"33132",7849,"people were. She did not seem to feel guilty about anything at all, and","The Trial"
"33133",7849,"K., as often before, looked down at the belt of her apron which, for no","The Trial"
"33134",7849,"reason, cut so deeply into her hefty body. Once downstairs, K., with his","The Trial"
"33135",7849,"watch in his hand, decided to take a taxi&mdash;he had already been delayed","The Trial"
"33136",7849,"by half an hour and there was no need to make the delay any longer.","The Trial"
"33137",7849,"Kaminer ran to the corner to summon it, and the two others were making","The Trial"
"33138",7849,"obvious efforts to keep K. diverted when Kullich pointed to the doorway","The Trial"
"33139",7849,"of the house on the other side of the street where the large man with","The Trial"
"33140",7849,"the blonde goatee beard appeared and, a little embarrassed at first at","The Trial"
"33141",7849,"letting himself be seen in his full height, stepped back to the wall and","The Trial"
"33142",7849,"leant against it. The old couple were probably still on the stairs. K.","The Trial"
"33143",7849,"was cross with Kullich for pointing out this man whom he had already","The Trial"
"33144",7849,"seen himself, in fact whom he had been expecting. ""Don't look at him!""","The Trial"
"33145",7849,"he snapped, without noticing how odd it was to speak to free men in this","The Trial"
"33146",7849,"way. But there was no explanation needed anyway as just then the taxi","The Trial"
"33147",7849,"arrived, they sat inside and set off. Inside the taxi, K. remembered","The Trial"
"33148",7849,"that he had not noticed the supervisor and the policemen leaving&mdash;the","The Trial"
"33149",7849,"supervisor had stopped him noticing the three bank staff and now the","The Trial"
"33150",7849,"three bank staff had stopped him noticing the supervisor. This showed","The Trial"
"33151",7849,"that K. was not very attentive, and he resolved to watch himself more","The Trial"
"33152",7849,"carefully in this respect. Nonetheless, he gave it no thought as he","The Trial"
"33153",7849,"twisted himself round and leant over onto the rear shelf of the car to","The Trial"
"33154",7849,"catch sight of the supervisor and the policemen if he could. But he","The Trial"
"33155",7849,"turned back round straight away and leant comfortably into the corner of","The Trial"
"33156",7849,"the taxi without even having made the effort to see anyone. Although it","The Trial"
"33157",7849,"did not seem like it, now was just the time when he needed some","The Trial"
"33158",7849,"encouragement, but the gentlemen seemed tired just then, Rabensteiner","The Trial"
"33159",7849,"looked out of the car to the right, Kullich to the left and only Kaminer","The Trial"
"33160",7849,"was there with his grin at K.'s service. It would have been inhumane to","The Trial"
"33161",7849,"make fun of that.</p>","The Trial"
"33162",7849,"","The Trial"
"33163",7849,"<p>That spring, whenever possible, K. usually spent his evenings after","The Trial"

"33165",7849,"walk, either by himself or in the company of some of the bank officials,","The Trial"
"33166",7849,"and then he would go into a pub where he would sit at the regulars'","The Trial"

"33168",7849,"exceptions to this habit, times, for instance, when K. was invited by","The Trial"
"33169",7849,"the bank's manager (whom he greatly respected for his industry and","The Trial"
"33170",7849,"trustworthiness) to go with him for a ride in his car or to eat dinner","The Trial"
"33171",7849,"with him at his large house. K. would also go, once a week, to see a","The Trial"
"33172",7849,"girl called Elsa who worked as a waitress in a wine bar through the","The Trial"
"33173",7849,"night until late in the morning. During the daytime she only received","The Trial"

"33176",7849,"<p>That evening, though,&mdash;the day had passed quickly with a lot of hard","The Trial"
"33177",7849,"work and many respectful and friendly birthday greetings&mdash;K. wanted to","The Trial"
"33178",7849,"go straight home. Each time he had any small break from the day's work","The Trial"
"33179",7849,"he considered, without knowing exactly what he had in mind, that Mrs.","The Trial"
"33180",7849,"Grubach's flat seemed to have been put into great disarray by the events","The Trial"

"33182",7849,"Once order had been restored, every trace of those events would have","The Trial"
"33183",7849,"been erased and everything would take its previous course once more. In","The Trial"

"33185",7849,"they had immersed themselves back into their paperwork and there was no","The Trial"
"33186",7849,"alteration to be seen in them. K. had called each of them, separately or","The Trial"
"33187",7849,"all together, into his office that day for no other reason than to","The Trial"

"33193",7849,"standing there, his legs apart and smoking a pipe. ""Who are you?""","The Trial"
"33194",7849,"immediately asked K., bringing his face close to the lad's, as it was","The Trial"
"33195",7849,"hard to see in the half light of the landing. ""I'm the landlord's son,","The Trial"
"33196",7849,"sir,"" answered the lad, taking the pipe from his mouth and stepping to","The Trial"
"33197",7849,"one side. ""The landlord's son?"" asked K., and impatiently knocked on the","The Trial"
"33198",7849,"ground with his stick. ""Did you want anything, sir? Would you like me","The Trial"
"33199",7849,"to fetch my father?"" ""No, no,"" said K., there was something forgiving","The Trial"
"33200",7849,"in his voice, as if the boy had harmed him in some way and he was","The Trial"
"33201",7849,"excusing him. ""It's alright,"" he said then, and went on, but before","The Trial"
"33202",7849,"going up the stairs he turned round once more.</p>","The Trial"
"33203",7849,"","The Trial"
"33204",7849,"<p>He could have gone directly to his room, but as he wanted to speak with","The Trial"
"33205",7849,"Mrs. Grubach he went straight to her door and knocked. She was sat at","The Trial"
"33206",7849,"the table with a knitted stocking and a pile of old stockings in front","The Trial"
"33207",7849,"of her. K. apologised, a little embarrassed at coming so late, but Mrs.","The Trial"
"33208",7849,"Grubach was very friendly and did not want to hear any apology, she was","The Trial"
"33209",7849,"always ready to speak to him, he knew very well that he was her best and","The Trial"
"33210",7849,"her favourite tenant. K. looked round the room, it looked exactly as it","The Trial"
"33211",7849,"usually did, the breakfast dishes, which had been on the table by the","The Trial"
"33212",7849,"window that morning, had already been cleared away. ""A woman's hands","The Trial"
"33213",7849,"will do many things when no-one's looking,"" he thought, he might himself","The Trial"
"33214",7849,"have smashed all the dishes on the spot but certainly would not have","The Trial"
"33215",7849,"been able to carry it all out. He looked at Mrs. Grubach with some","The Trial"
"33216",7849,"gratitude. ""Why are you working so late?"" he asked. They were now both","The Trial"
"33217",7849,"sitting at the table, and K. now and then sank his hands into the pile","The Trial"
"33218",7849,"of stockings. ""There's a lot of work to do,"" she said, ""during the day I","The Trial"
"33219",7849,"belong to the tenants; if I'm to sort out my own things there are only","The Trial"
"33220",7849,"the evenings left to me."" ""I fear I may have caused you some exceptional","The Trial"
"33221",7849,"work today."" ""How do you mean, Mr. K.?"" she asked, becoming more","The Trial"
"33222",7849,"interested and leaving her work in her lap. ""I mean the men who were","The Trial"
"33223",7849,"here this morning."" ""Oh, I see,"" she said, and went peacefully back to","The Trial"
"33224",7849,"what she was doing, ""that was no trouble, not especially."" K. looked on","The Trial"
"33225",7849,"in silence as she took up the knitted stocking once more. She seems","The Trial"
"33226",7849,"surprised at my mentioning it, he thought, she seems to think it's","The Trial"
"33227",7849,"improper for me to mention it. All the more important for me to do so.","The Trial"
"33228",7849,"An old woman is the only person I can speak about it with. ""But it must","The Trial"
"33229",7849,"have caused some work for you,"" he said then, ""but it won't happen","The Trial"
"33230",7849,"again."" ""No, it can't happen again,"" she agreed, and smiled at K. in a","The Trial"
"33231",7849,"way that was almost pained. ""Do you mean that seriously?"" asked K.","The Trial"
"33232",7849,"""Yes,"" she said, more gently, ""but the important thing is you mustn't","The Trial"
"33233",7849,"take it too hard. There are so many awful things happening in the world!","The Trial"
"33234",7849,"As you're being so honest with me, Mr. K., I can admit to you that I","The Trial"
"33235",7849,"listened to a little of what was going on from behind the door, and that","The Trial"
"33236",7849,"those two policemen told me one or two things as well. It's all to do","The Trial"
"33237",7849,"with your happiness, and that's something that's quite close to my","The Trial"
"33238",7849,"heart, perhaps more than it should be as I am, after all, only your","The Trial"
"33239",7849,"landlady. Anyway, so I heard one or two things but I can't really say","The Trial"
"33240",7849,"that it's about anything very serious. No. You have been arrested, but","The Trial"
"33241",7849,"it's not in the same way as when they arrest a thief. If you're arrested","The Trial"
"33242",7849,"in the same way as a thief, then it's bad, but an arrest like this....","The Trial"
"33243",7849,"It seems to me that it's something very complicated&mdash;forgive me if I'm","The Trial"
"33244",7849,"saying something stupid&mdash;something very complicated that I don't","The Trial"
"33245",7849,"understand, but something that you don't really need to understand","The Trial"
"33246",7849,"anyway.""</p>","The Trial"
"33247",7849,"","The Trial"
"33248",7849,"<p>""There's nothing stupid about what you've said, Mrs. Grubach, or at","The Trial"
"33249",7849,"least I partly agree with you, only, the way I judge the whole thing is","The Trial"
"33250",7849,"harsher than yours, and think it's not only not something complicated","The Trial"
"33251",7849,"but simply a fuss about nothing. I was just caught unawares, that's what","The Trial"
"33252",7849,"happened. If I had got up as soon as I was awake without letting myself","The Trial"
"33253",7849,"get confused because Anna wasn't there, if I'd got up and paid no regard","The Trial"
"33254",7849,"to anyone who might have been in my way and come straight to you, if I'd","The Trial"
"33255",7849,"done something like having my breakfast in the kitchen as an exception,","The Trial"
"33256",7849,"asked you to bring my clothes from my room, in short, if I had behaved","The Trial"
"33257",7849,"sensibly then nothing more would have happened, everything that was","The Trial"
"33258",7849,"waiting to happen would have been stifled. People are so often","The Trial"
"33259",7849,"unprepared. In the bank, for example, I am well prepared, nothing of","The Trial"
"33260",7849,"this sort could possibly happen to me there, I have my own assistant","The Trial"
"33261",7849,"there, there are telephones for internal and external calls in front of","The Trial"
"33262",7849,"me on the desk, I continually receive visits from people,","The Trial"
"33263",7849,"representatives, officials, but besides that, and most importantly, I'm","The Trial"
"33264",7849,"always occupied with my work, that's to say I'm always alert, it would","The Trial"
"33265",7849,"even be a pleasure for me to find myself faced with something of that","The Trial"
"33266",7849,"sort. But now it's over with, and I didn't really even want to talk","The Trial"
"33267",7849,"about it any more, only I wanted to hear what you, as a sensible woman,","The Trial"
"33268",7849,"thought about it all, and I'm very glad to hear that we're in agreement.","The Trial"
"33269",7849,"But now you must give me your hand, an agreement of this sort needs to","The Trial"
"33270",7849,"be confirmed with a handshake.""</p>","The Trial"
"33271",7849,"","The Trial"
"33272",7849,"<p>Will she shake hands with me? The supervisor didn't shake hands, he","The Trial"
"33273",7849,"thought, and looked at the woman differently from before, examining her.","The Trial"
"33274",7849,"She stood up, as he had also stood up, and was a little self-conscious,","The Trial"
"33275",7849,"she hadn't been able to understand everything that K. said. As a result","The Trial"
"33276",7849,"of this self-consciousness she said something that she certainly did","The Trial"
"33277",7849,"not intend and certainly was not appropriate. ""Don't take it so hard,","The Trial"
"33278",7849,"Mr. K.,"" she said, with tears in her voice and also, of course,","The Trial"
"33279",7849,"forgetting the handshake. ""I didn't know I was taking it hard,"" said K.,","The Trial"
"33280",7849,"feeling suddenly tired and seeing that if this woman did agree with him","The Trial"
"33281",7849,"it was of very little value.</p>","The Trial"
"33282",7849,"","The Trial"
"33283",7849,"<p>Before going out the door he asked, ""Is Miss Bürstner home?"" ""No,"" said","The Trial"
"33284",7849,"Mrs. Grubach, smiling as she gave this simple piece of information,","The Trial"
"33285",7849,"saying something sensible at last. ""She's at the theatre. Did you want","The Trial"
"33286",7849,"to see her? Should I give her a message?"" ""I, er, I just wanted to have","The Trial"
"33287",7849,"a few words with her."" ""I'm afraid I don't know when she's coming in;","The Trial"
"33288",7849,"she usually gets back late when she's been to the theatre."" ""It really","The Trial"
"33289",7849,"doesn't matter,"" said K. his head hanging as he turned to the door to","The Trial"
"33290",7849,"leave, ""I just wanted to give her my apology for taking over her room","The Trial"
"33291",7849,"today."" ""There's no need for that, Mr. K., you're too conscientious, the","The Trial"
"33292",7849,"young lady doesn't know anything about it, she hasn't been home since","The Trial"
"33293",7849,"early this morning and everything's been tidied up again, you can see","The Trial"
"33294",7849,"for yourself."" And she opened the door to Miss Bürstner's room. ""Thank","The Trial"
"33295",7849,"you, I'll take your word for it,"" said K., but went nonetheless over to","The Trial"
"33296",7849,"the open door. The moon shone quietly into the unlit room. As far as","The Trial"
"33297",7849,"could be seen, everything was indeed in its place, not even the blouse","The Trial"
"33298",7849,"was hanging on the window handle. The pillows on the bed looked","The Trial"
"33299",7849,"remarkably plump as they lay half in the moonlight. ""Miss Bürstner often","The Trial"
"33300",7849,"comes home late,"" said K., looking at Mrs. Grubach as if that were her","The Trial"
"33301",7849,"responsibility. ""That's how young people are!"" said Mrs. Grubach to","The Trial"
"33302",7849,"excuse herself. ""Of course, of course,"" said K., ""but it can be taken","The Trial"
"33303",7849,"too far."" ""Yes, it can be,"" said Mrs. Grubach, ""you're so right, Mr. K.","The Trial"
"33304",7849,"Perhaps it is in this case. I certainly wouldn't want to say anything","The Trial"
"33305",7849,"nasty about Miss Bürstner, she is a good, sweet girl, friendly, tidy,","The Trial"
"33306",7849,"punctual, works hard, I appreciate all that very much, but one thing is","The Trial"
"33307",7849,"true, she ought to have more pride, be a bit less forthcoming. Twice","The Trial"
"33308",7849,"this month already, in the street over the way, I've seen her with a","The Trial"
"33309",7849,"different gentleman. I really don't like saying this, you're the only","The Trial"
"33310",7849,"one I've said this to, Mr. K., I swear to God, but I'm going to have no","The Trial"
"33311",7849,"choice but to have a few words with Miss Bürstner about it myself. And","The Trial"
"33312",7849,"it's not the only thing about her that I'm worried about."" ""Mrs.","The Trial"
"33313",7849,"Grubach, you are on quite the wrong track,"" said K., so angry that he","The Trial"
"33314",7849,"was hardly able to hide it, ""and you have moreover misunderstood what I","The Trial"
"33315",7849,"was saying about Miss Bürstner, that is not what I meant. In fact I warn","The Trial"
"33316",7849,"you quite directly not to say anything to her, you are quite mistaken, I","The Trial"
"33317",7849,"know Miss Bürstner very well and there is no truth at all in what you","The Trial"
"33318",7849,"say. And what's more, perhaps I'm going to far, I don't want to get in","The Trial"
"33319",7849,"your way, say to her whatever you see fit. Good night."" ""Mr. K.,"" said","The Trial"
"33320",7849,"Mrs. Grubach as if asking him for something and hurrying to his door","The Trial"
"33321",7849,"which he had already opened, ""I don't want to speak to Miss Bürstner at","The Trial"
"33322",7849,"all, not yet, of course I'll continue to keep an eye on her but you're","The Trial"
"33323",7849,"the only one I've told what I know. And it is, after all something that","The Trial"
"33324",7849,"everyone who lets rooms has to do if she's to keep the house decent,","The Trial"
"33325",7849,"that's all I'm trying to do."" ""Decent!"" called out K. through the crack","The Trial"
"33326",7849,"in the door, ""if you want to keep the house decent you'll first have to","The Trial"
"33327",7849,"give me notice."" Then he slammed the door shut, there was a gentle","The Trial"
"33328",7849,"knocking to which he paid no more attention.</p>","The Trial"
"33329",7849,"","The Trial"
"33330",7849,"<p>He did not feel at all like going to bed, so he decided to stay up, and","The Trial"
"33331",7849,"this would also give him the chance to find out when Miss Bürstner would","The Trial"
"33332",7849,"arrive home. Perhaps it would also still be possible, even if a little","The Trial"
"33333",7849,"inappropriate, to have a few words with her. As he lay there by the","The Trial"
"33334",7849,"window, pressing his hands to his tired eyes, he even thought for a","The Trial"
"33335",7849,"moment that he might punish Mrs. Grubach by persuading Miss Bürstner to","The Trial"
"33336",7849,"give in her notice at the same time as he would. But he immediately","The Trial"
"33337",7849,"realised that that would be shockingly excessive, and there would even","The Trial"
"33338",7849,"be the suspicion that he was moving house because of the incidents of","The Trial"
"33339",7849,"that morning. Nothing would have been more nonsensical and, above all,","The Trial"
"33340",7849,"more pointless and contemptible.</p>","The Trial"
"33341",7849,"","The Trial"
"33342",7849,"<p>When he had become tired of looking out onto the empty street he","The Trial"
"33343",7849,"slightly opened the door to the living room so that he could see anyone","The Trial"
"33344",7849,"who entered the flat from where he was and lay down on the couch. He lay","The Trial"
"33345",7849,"there, quietly smoking a cigar, until about eleven o'clock. He wasn't","The Trial"
"33346",7849,"able to hold out longer than that, and went a little way into the","The Trial"
"33347",7849,"hallway as if in that way he could make Miss Bürstner arrive sooner. He","The Trial"
"33348",7849,"had no particular desire for her, he could not even remember what she","The Trial"
"33349",7849,"looked like, but now he wanted to speak to her and it irritated him that","The Trial"
"33350",7849,"her late arrival home meant this day would be full of unease and","The Trial"
"33351",7849,"disorder right to its very end. It was also her fault that he had not","The Trial"
"33352",7849,"had any dinner that evening and that he had been unable to visit Elsa","The Trial"
"33353",7849,"as he had intended. He could still make up for both of those things,","The Trial"
"33354",7849,"though, if he went to the wine bar where Elsa worked. He wanted to do so","The Trial"
"33355",7849,"even later, after the discussion with Miss Bürstner.</p>","The Trial"
"33356",7849,"","The Trial"
"33357",7849,"<p>It was already gone half past eleven when someone could be heard in the","The Trial"
"33358",7849,"stairway. K., who had been lost in his thoughts in the hallway, walking","The Trial"
"33359",7849,"up and down loudly as if it were his own room, fled behind his door.","The Trial"
"33360",7849,"Miss Bürstner had arrived. Shivering, she pulled a silk shawl over her","The Trial"

"33365",7849,"when he stepped out of the dark it would give the impression of being an","The Trial"
"33366",7849,"attack and would certainly, at the very least, have been quite alarming.","The Trial"
"33367",7849,"There was no time to lose, and in his helplessness he whispered through","The Trial"
"33368",7849,"the crack of the door, ""Miss Bürstner."" It sounded like he was pleading","The Trial"
"33369",7849,"with her, not calling to her. ""Is there someone there?"" asked Miss","The Trial"
"33370",7849,"Bürstner, looking round with her eyes wide open. ""It's me,"" said K. and","The Trial"
"33371",7849,"came out. ""Oh, Mr. K.!"" said Miss Bürstner with a smile. ""Good Evening,""","The Trial"
"33372",7849,"and offered him her hand. ""I wanted to have a word with you, if you","The Trial"
"33373",7849,"would allow me?"" ""Now?"" asked Miss Bürstner, ""does it have to be now? It","The Trial"
"33374",7849,"is a little odd, isn't it?"" ""I've been waiting for you since nine","The Trial"

"33376",7849,"waiting for me."" ""The reason I need to speak to you only came up","The Trial"
"33377",7849,"today."" ""I see, well I don't see why not, I suppose, apart from being","The Trial"
"33378",7849,"so tired I could drop. Come into my room for a few minutes then. We","The Trial"
"33379",7849,"certainly can't talk out here, we'd wake everyone up and I think that","The Trial"
"33380",7849,"would be more unpleasant for us than for them. Wait here till I've put","The Trial"
"33381",7849,"the light on in my room, and then turn the light down out here."" K. did","The Trial"
"33382",7849,"as he was told, and then even waited until Miss Bürstner came out of her","The Trial"
"33383",7849,"room and quietly invited him, once more, to come in. ""Sit down,"" she","The Trial"
"33384",7849,"said, indicating the ottoman, while she herself remained standing by","The Trial"
"33385",7849,"the bedpost despite the tiredness she had spoken of; she did not even","The Trial"
"33386",7849,"take off her hat, which was small but decorated with an abundance of","The Trial"
"33387",7849,"flowers. ""What is it you wanted, then? I'm really quite curious."" She","The Trial"
"33388",7849,"gently crossed her legs. ""I expect you'll say,"" K. began, ""that the","The Trial"
"33389",7849,"matter really isn't all that urgent and we don't need to talk about it","The Trial"
"33390",7849,"right now, but...."" ""I never listen to introductions,"" said Miss","The Trial"

"33392",7849,"some extent through my fault, your room was made a little untidy, this","The Trial"
"33393",7849,"happened because of people I did not know and against my will but, as I","The Trial"
"33394",7849,"said, because of my fault; I wanted to apologise for it."" ""My room?""","The Trial"
"33395",7849,"asked Miss Bürstner, and instead of looking round the room scrutinised","The Trial"
"33396",7849,"K. ""It is true,"" said K., and now, for the first time, they looked each","The Trial"
"33397",7849,"other in the eyes, ""there's no point in saying exactly how this came","The Trial"
"33398",7849,"about."" ""But that's the interesting thing about it,"" said Miss Bürstner.","The Trial"
"33399",7849,"""No,"" said K. ""Well then,"" said Miss Bürstner, ""I don't want to force my","The Trial"

"33402",7849,"I can't see anything at all that's been left untidy."" With her hand laid","The Trial"
"33403",7849,"flat on her lower hip, she made a tour around the room. At the mat where","The Trial"
"33404",7849,"the photographs were she stopped. ""Look at this!"" she cried. ""My","The Trial"
"33405",7849,"photographs really have been put in the wrong places. Oh, that's","The Trial"
"33406",7849,"horrible. Someone really has been in my room without permission."" K.","The Trial"
"33407",7849,"nodded, and quietly cursed Kaminer who worked at his bank and who was","The Trial"
"33408",7849,"always active doing things that had neither use nor purpose. ""It is","The Trial"
"33409",7849,"odd,"" said Miss Bürstner, ""that I'm forced to forbid you to do something","The Trial"

"33414",7849,"that the investigating committee brought along three bank employees with","The Trial"
"33415",7849,"them, one of them must have touched your photographs and as soon as I","The Trial"
"33416",7849,"get the chance I'll ask to have him dismissed from the bank. Yes, there","The Trial"

"33418",7849,"looking at him enquiringly. ""Because of you?"" she asked. ""Yes,"" answered","The Trial"
"33419",7849,"K. ""No!"" the lady cried with a laugh. ""Yes, they were,"" said K., ""you","The Trial"
"33420",7849,"believe that I'm innocent then, do you?"" ""Well now, innocent ..."" said","The Trial"
"33421",7849,"the lady, ""I don't want to start making any pronouncements that might","The Trial"
"33422",7849,"have serious consequences, I don't really know you after all, it means","The Trial"
"33423",7849,"they're dealing with a serious criminal if they send an investigating","The Trial"
"33424",7849,"committee straight out to get him. But you're not in custody now&mdash;at","The Trial"
"33425",7849,"least I take it you've not escaped from prison considering that you seem","The Trial"
"33426",7849,"quite calm&mdash;so you can't have committed any crime of that sort."" ""Yes,""","The Trial"
"33427",7849,"said K., ""but it might be that the investigating committee could see","The Trial"
"33428",7849,"that I'm innocent, or not so guilty as had been supposed."" ""Yes, that's","The Trial"
"33429",7849,"certainly a possibility,"" said Miss Bürstner, who seemed very","The Trial"
"33430",7849,"interested. ""Listen,"" said K., ""you don't have much experience in legal","The Trial"
"33431",7849,"matters."" ""No, that's true, I don't,"" said Miss Bürstner, ""and I've","The Trial"
"33432",7849,"often regretted it, as I'd like to know everything and I'm very","The Trial"
"33433",7849,"interested in legal matters. There's something peculiarly attractive","The Trial"
"33434",7849,"about the law, isn't there. But I'll certainly be perfecting my","The Trial"

"33436",7849,"""That's very good,"" said K., ""that means you'll be able to give me some","The Trial"
"33437",7849,"help with my trial."" ""That could well be,"" said Miss Bürstner, ""why not?","The Trial"
"33438",7849,"I like to make use of what I know."" ""I mean it quite seriously,"" said","The Trial"
"33439",7849,"K., ""or at least, half seriously, as you do. This affair is too petty to","The Trial"

"33441",7849,"advice."" ""Yes, but if I'm to give you advice I'll have to know what it's","The Trial"
"33442",7849,"all about,"" said Miss Bürstner. ""That's exactly the problem,"" said K.,","The Trial"
"33443",7849,"""I don't know that myself."" ""So you have been making fun of me, then,""","The Trial"
"33444",7849,"said Miss Bürstner exceedingly disappointed, ""you really ought not to","The Trial"

"33449",7849,"it actually wasn't even an investigating committee, that's just what I","The Trial"

"33451",7849,"cross questioning at all, I was merely arrested, but by a committee.""","The Trial"
"33452",7849,"Miss Bürstner sat on the ottoman and laughed again. ""What was it like","The Trial"

"33457",7849,"""That's too vague,"" said Miss Bürstner. ""What's too vague?"" asked K.","The Trial"
"33458",7849,"Then he remembered himself and asked, ""Would you like me to show you","The Trial"

"33467",7849,"can't show you,"" said K., quite upset, as if Miss Bürstner had committed","The Trial"
"33468",7849,"some incomprehensible offence against him. ""Alright then, if you need it","The Trial"
"33469",7849,"to show what you mean, just take the bedside table then,"" said Miss","The Trial"
"33470",7849,"Bürstner, and after a short pause added in a weak voice, ""I'm so tired","The Trial"
"33471",7849,"I'm allowing more than I ought to."" K. put the little table in the","The Trial"
"33472",7849,"middle of the room and sat down behind it. ""You have to get a proper","The Trial"
"33473",7849,"idea of where the people were situated, it is very interesting. I'm the","The Trial"
"33474",7849,"supervisor, sitting over there on the chest are two policemen, standing","The Trial"
"33475",7849,"next to the photographs there are three young people. Hanging on the","The Trial"
"33476",7849,"handle of the window is a white blouse&mdash;I just mention that by the way.","The Trial"
"33477",7849,"And now it begins. Ah yes, I'm forgetting myself, the most important","The Trial"
"33478",7849,"person of all, so I'm standing here in front of the table. The","The Trial"
"33479",7849,"supervisor is sitting extremely comfortably with his legs crossed and","The Trial"
"33480",7849,"his arm hanging over the backrest here like some layabout. And now it","The Trial"
"33481",7849,"really does begin. The supervisor calls out as if he had to wake me up,","The Trial"
"33482",7849,"in fact he shouts at me, I'm afraid, if I'm to make it clear to you,","The Trial"
"33483",7849,"I'll have to shout as well, and it's nothing more than my name that he","The Trial"
"33484",7849,"shouts out."" Miss Bürstner, laughing as she listened to him, laid her","The Trial"
"33485",7849,"forefinger on her mouth so that K. would not shout, but it was too late.","The Trial"
"33486",7849,"K. was too engrossed in his role and slowly called out, ""Josef K.!"" It","The Trial"

"33491",7849,"<p>There was a series of loud, curt and regular knocks at the door of the","The Trial"

"33493",7849,"K. was especially startled, as for a moment he had been quite unable to","The Trial"

"33495",7849,"whom he was performing them. He had hardly pulled himself together when","The Trial"
"33496",7849,"he jumped over to Miss Bürstner and took her hand. ""Don't be afraid,"" he","The Trial"
"33497",7849,"whispered, ""I'll put everything right. But who can it be? It's only the","The Trial"
"33498",7849,"living room next door, nobody sleeps in there."" ""Yes they do,"" whispered","The Trial"
"33499",7849,"Miss Bürstner into K.'s ear, ""a nephew of Mrs. Grubach's, a captain in","The Trial"
"33500",7849,"the army, has been sleeping there since yesterday. There's no other room","The Trial"
"33501",7849,"free. I'd forgotten about it too. Why did you have to shout like that?","The Trial"
"33502",7849,"You've made me quite upset."" ""There is no reason for it,"" said K., and,","The Trial"
"33503",7849,"now as she sank back onto the cushion, kissed her forehead. ""Go away, go","The Trial"
"33504",7849,"away,"" she said, hurriedly sitting back up, ""get out of here, go, what","The Trial"
"33505",7849,"is it you want, he's listening at the door, he can hear everything.","The Trial"
"33506",7849,"You're causing me so much trouble!"" ""I won't go,"" said K., ""until you've","The Trial"
"33507",7849,"calmed down a bit. Come over into the other corner of the room, he","The Trial"
"33508",7849,"won't be able to hear us there."" She let him lead her there. ""Don't","The Trial"
"33509",7849,"forget,"" he said, ""although this might be unpleasant for you you're not","The Trial"
"33510",7849,"in any real danger. You know how much esteem Mrs. Grubach has for me,","The Trial"
"33511",7849,"she's the one who will make all the decisions in this, especially as the","The Trial"
"33512",7849,"captain is her nephew, but she believes everything I say without","The Trial"
"33513",7849,"question. What's more, she has borrowed a large sum of money from me and","The Trial"
"33514",7849,"that makes her dependent on me. I will confirm whatever you say to","The Trial"
"33515",7849,"explain our being here together, however inappropriate it might be, and","The Trial"
"33516",7849,"I guarantee to make sure that Mrs. Grubach will not only say she","The Trial"
"33517",7849,"believes the explanation in public but will believe it truly and","The Trial"
"33518",7849,"sincerely. You will have no need to consider me in any way. If you wish","The Trial"
"33519",7849,"to let it be known that I have attacked you then Mrs. Grubach will be","The Trial"
"33520",7849,"informed of such and she will believe it without even losing her trust","The Trial"
"33521",7849,"in me, that's how much respect she has for me."" Miss Bürstner looked at","The Trial"
"33522",7849,"the floor in front of her, quiet and a little sunk in on herself. ""Why","The Trial"
"33523",7849,"would Mrs. Grubach not believe that I've attacked you?"" added K. He","The Trial"
"33524",7849,"looked at her hair in front of him, parted, bunched down, reddish and","The Trial"
"33525",7849,"firmly held in place. He thought she would look up at him, but without","The Trial"
"33526",7849,"changing her manner she said, ""Forgive me, but it was the suddenness of","The Trial"
"33527",7849,"the knocking that startled me so much, not so much what the consequences","The Trial"
"33528",7849,"of the captain being here might be. It was all so quiet after you'd","The Trial"
"33529",7849,"shouted, and then there was the knocking, that's what made me so","The Trial"
"33530",7849,"shocked, and I was sitting right by the door, the knocking was right","The Trial"
"33531",7849,"next to me. Thank you for your suggestions, but I won't accept them. I","The Trial"
"33532",7849,"can bear the responsibility for anything that happens in my room myself,","The Trial"
"33533",7849,"and I can do so with anyone. I'm surprised you don't realise just how","The Trial"
"33534",7849,"insulting your suggestions are and what they imply about me, although I","The Trial"
"33535",7849,"certainly acknowledge your good intentions. But now, please go, leave me","The Trial"
"33536",7849,"alone, I need you to go now even more than I did earlier. The couple of","The Trial"
"33537",7849,"minutes you asked for have grown into half an hour, more than half an","The Trial"
"33538",7849,"hour now."" K. took hold of her hand, and then of her wrist, ""You're not","The Trial"
"33539",7849,"cross with me, though?"" he said. She pulled her hand away and answered,","The Trial"
"33540",7849,"""No, no, I'm never cross with anyone."" He grasped her wrist once more,","The Trial"
"33541",7849,"she tolerated it now and, in that way, led him to the door. He had","The Trial"
"33542",7849,"fully intended to leave. But when he reached the door he came to a halt","The Trial"
"33543",7849,"as if he hadn't expected to find a door there, Miss Bürstner made use of","The Trial"
"33544",7849,"that moment to get herself free, open the door, slip out into the","The Trial"

"33549",7849,"the mouth and then over her whole face like a thirsty animal lapping","The Trial"
"33550",7849,"with its tongue when it eventually finds water. He finally kissed her on","The Trial"
"33551",7849,"her neck and her throat and left his lips pressed there for a long time.","The Trial"

"33597",7849,"in his way. ""Bad news?"" asked the deputy director casually, not in order","The Trial"
"33598",7849,"to find anything out but just to get K. away from the device. ""No, no,""","The Trial"
"33599",7849,"said K., he stepped to one side but did not go away entirely. The deputy","The Trial"
"33600",7849,"director picked up the receiver and, as he waited for his connection,","The Trial"
"33601",7849,"turned away from it and said to K., ""One question, Mr. K.: Would you","The Trial"
"33602",7849,"like to give me the pleasure of joining me on my sailing boat on Sunday","The Trial"
"33603",7849,"morning? There's quite a few people coming, you're bound to know some","The Trial"
"33604",7849,"of them. One of them is Hasterer, the state attorney. Would you like to","The Trial"
"33605",7849,"come along? Do come along!"" K. tried to pay attention to what the","The Trial"
"33606",7849,"deputy director was saying. It was of no small importance for him, as","The Trial"
"33607",7849,"this invitation from the deputy director, with whom he had never got on","The Trial"
"33608",7849,"very well, meant that he was trying to improve his relations with him.","The Trial"
"33609",7849,"It showed how important K. had become in the bank and how its second","The Trial"
"33610",7849,"most important official seemed to value his friendship, or at least his","The Trial"
"33611",7849,"impartiality. He was only speaking at the side of the telephone receiver","The Trial"
"33612",7849,"while he waited for his connection, but in giving this invitation the","The Trial"
"33613",7849,"deputy director was humbling himself. But K. would have to humiliate him","The Trial"
"33614",7849,"a second time as a result, he said, ""Thank you very much, but I'm afraid","The Trial"
"33615",7849,"I will have no time on Sunday, I have a previous obligation."" ""Pity,""","The Trial"
"33616",7849,"said the deputy director, and turned to the telephone conversation that","The Trial"
"33617",7849,"had just been connected. It was not a short conversation, but K.","The Trial"
"33618",7849,"remained standing confused by the instrument all the time it was going","The Trial"
"33619",7849,"on. It was only when the deputy director hung up that he was shocked","The Trial"
"33620",7849,"into awareness and said, in order to partially excuse his standing there","The Trial"
"33621",7849,"for no reason, ""I've just received a telephone call, there's somewhere I","The Trial"
"33622",7849,"need to go, but they forgot to tell me what time."" ""Ask them then,"" said","The Trial"
"33623",7849,"the deputy director. ""It's not that important,"" said K., although in","The Trial"
"33624",7849,"that way his earlier excuse, already weak enough, was made even weaker.","The Trial"
"33625",7849,"As he went, the deputy director continued to speak about other things.","The Trial"
"33626",7849,"K. forced himself to answer, but his thoughts were mainly about that","The Trial"
"33627",7849,"Sunday, how it would be best to get there for nine o'clock in the","The Trial"
"33628",7849,"morning as that was the time that courts always start work on weekdays.</p>","The Trial"
"33629",7849,"","The Trial"
"33630",7849,"<p>The weather was dull on Sunday. K. was very tired, as he had stayed out","The Trial"
"33631",7849,"drinking until late in the night celebrating with some of the regulars,","The Trial"
"33632",7849,"and he had almost overslept. He dressed hurriedly, without the time to","The Trial"
"33633",7849,"think and assemble the various plans he had worked out during the week.","The Trial"
"33634",7849,"With no breakfast, he rushed to the suburb he had been told about. Oddly","The Trial"
"33635",7849,"enough, although he had little time to look around him, he came across","The Trial"
"33636",7849,"the three bank officials involved in his case, Rabensteiner, Kullich and","The Trial"
"33637",7849,"Kaminer. The first two were travelling in a tram that went across K.'s","The Trial"
"33638",7849,"route, but Kaminer sat on the terrace of a café and leant curiously","The Trial"
"33639",7849,"over the wall as K. came over. All of them seemed to be looking at him,","The Trial"
"33640",7849,"surprised at seeing their superior running; it was a kind of pride that","The Trial"
"33641",7849,"made K. want to go on foot, this was his affair and the idea of any help","The Trial"
"33642",7849,"from strangers, however slight, was repulsive to him, he also wanted to","The Trial"
"33643",7849,"avoid asking for anyone's help because that would initiate them into the","The Trial"
"33644",7849,"affair even if only slightly. And after all, he had no wish at all to","The Trial"
"33645",7849,"humiliate himself before the committee by being too punctual. Anyway,","The Trial"
"33646",7849,"now he was running so that he would get there by nine o'clock if at all","The Trial"
"33647",7849,"possible, even though he had no appointment for this time.</p>","The Trial"
"33648",7849,"","The Trial"
"33649",7849,"<p>He had thought that he would recognise the building from a distance by","The Trial"
"33650",7849,"some kind of sign, without knowing exactly what the sign would look","The Trial"
"33651",7849,"like, or from some particular kind of activity outside the entrance. K.","The Trial"
"33652",7849,"had been told that the building was in Juliusstrasse, but when he stood","The Trial"
"33653",7849,"at the street's entrance it consisted on each side of almost nothing but","The Trial"
"33654",7849,"monotonous, grey constructions, tall blocks of flats occupied by poor","The Trial"
"33655",7849,"people. Now, on a Sunday morning, most of the windows were occupied, men","The Trial"
"33656",7849,"in their shirtsleeves leant out smoking, or carefully and gently held","The Trial"
"33657",7849,"small children on the sills. Other windows were piled up with bedding,","The Trial"
"33658",7849,"above which the dishevelled head of a woman would briefly appear. People","The Trial"
"33659",7849,"called out to each other across the street, one of the calls provoked a","The Trial"
"33660",7849,"loud laugh about K. himself. It was a long street, and spaced evenly","The Trial"
"33661",7849,"along it were small shops below street level, selling various kinds of","The Trial"
"33662",7849,"foodstuffs, which you reached by going down a few steps. Women went in","The Trial"
"33663",7849,"and out of them or stood chatting on the steps. A fruitmonger, taking","The Trial"
"33664",7849,"his goods up to the windows, was just as inattentive as K. and nearly","The Trial"
"33665",7849,"knocked him down with his cart. Just then, a gramophone, which in better","The Trial"
"33666",7849,"parts of town would have been seen as worn out, began to play some","The Trial"
"33667",7849,"murderous tune.</p>","The Trial"
"33668",7849,"","The Trial"
"33669",7849,"<p>K. went further into the street, slowly, as if he had plenty of time","The Trial"
"33670",7849,"now, or as if the examining magistrate were looking at him from one of","The Trial"
"33671",7849,"the windows and therefore knew that K. had found his way there. It was","The Trial"
"33672",7849,"shortly after nine. The building was quite far down the street, it","The Trial"
"33673",7849,"covered so much area it was almost extraordinary, and the gateway in","The Trial"
"33674",7849,"particular was tall and long. It was clearly intended for delivery","The Trial"
"33675",7849,"wagons belonging to the various warehouses all round the yard which were","The Trial"
"33676",7849,"now locked up and carried the names of companies some of which K. knew","The Trial"
"33677",7849,"from his work at the bank. In contrast with his usual habits, he","The Trial"
"33678",7849,"remained standing a while at the entrance to the yard taking in all","The Trial"
"33679",7849,"these external details. Near him, there was a bare-footed man sitting on","The Trial"
"33680",7849,"a crate and reading a newspaper. There were two lads swinging on a hand","The Trial"
"33681",7849,"cart. In front of a pump stood a weak, young girl in a bedjacket who, as","The Trial"
"33682",7849,"the water flowed into her can, looked at K. There was a piece of rope","The Trial"
"33683",7849,"stretched between two windows in a corner of the yard, with some washing","The Trial"
"33684",7849,"hanging on it to dry. A man stood below it calling out instructions to","The Trial"

"33686",7849,"","The Trial"
"33687",7849,"<p>K. went over to the stairway to get to the room where the hearing was to","The Trial"
"33688",7849,"take place, but then stood still again as besides these steps he could","The Trial"
"33689",7849,"see three other stairway entrances, and there also seemed to be a small","The Trial"
"33690",7849,"passageway at the end of the yard leading into a second yard. It","The Trial"
"33691",7849,"irritated him that he had not been given more precise directions to the","The Trial"
"33692",7849,"room, it meant they were either being especially neglectful with him or","The Trial"
"33693",7849,"especially indifferent, and he decided to make that clear to them very","The Trial"
"33694",7849,"loudly and very unambiguously. In the end he decided to climb up the","The Trial"
"33695",7849,"stairs, his thoughts playing on something that he remembered the","The Trial"
"33696",7849,"policeman, Willem, saying to him; that the court is attracted by the","The Trial"
"33697",7849,"guilt, from which it followed that the courtroom must be on the stairway","The Trial"

"33699",7849,"","The Trial"
"33700",7849,"<p>As he went up he disturbed a large group of children playing on the","The Trial"
"33701",7849,"stairs who looked at him as he stepped through their rows. ""Next time I","The Trial"
"33702",7849,"come here,"" he said to himself, ""I must either bring sweets with me to","The Trial"

"33704",7849,"the first landing he even had to wait a little while until a ball had","The Trial"
"33705",7849,"finished its movement, two small lads with sly faces like grown-up","The Trial"
"33706",7849,"scoundrels held him by his trouser-legs until it had; if he were to","The Trial"
"33707",7849,"shake them off he would have to hurt them, and he was afraid of what","The Trial"

"33709",7849,"","The Trial"
"33710",7849,"<p>On the first floor, his search began for real. He still felt unable to","The Trial"
"33711",7849,"ask for the investigating committee, and so he invented a joiner called","The Trial"
"33712",7849,"Lanz&mdash;that name occurred to him because the captain, Mrs. Grubach's","The Trial"
"33713",7849,"nephew, was called Lanz&mdash;so that he could ask at every flat whether Lanz","The Trial"
"33714",7849,"the joiner lived there and thus obtain a chance to look into the rooms.","The Trial"
"33715",7849,"It turned out, though, that that was mostly possible without further","The Trial"
"33716",7849,"ado, as almost all the doors were left open and the children ran in and","The Trial"
"33717",7849,"out. Most of them were small, one-windowed rooms where they also did the","The Trial"
"33718",7849,"cooking. Many women held babies in one arm and worked at the stove with","The Trial"
"33719",7849,"the other. Half grown girls, who seemed to be dressed in just their","The Trial"
"33720",7849,"pinafores worked hardest running to and fro. In every room, the beds","The Trial"
"33721",7849,"were still in use by people who were ill, or still asleep, or people","The Trial"
"33722",7849,"stretched out on them in their clothes. K. knocked at the flats where","The Trial"
"33723",7849,"the doors were closed and asked whether Lanz the joiner lived there. It","The Trial"
"33724",7849,"was usually a woman who opened the door, heard the enquiry and turned to","The Trial"
"33725",7849,"somebody in the room who would raise himself from the bed. ""The","The Trial"
"33726",7849,"gentleman's asking if a joiner called Lanz, lives here."" ""A joiner,","The Trial"
"33727",7849,"called Lanz?"" he would ask from the bed."" ""That's right,"" K. would say,","The Trial"
"33728",7849,"although it was clear that the investigating committee was not to be","The Trial"
"33729",7849,"found there, and so his task was at an end. There were many who thought","The Trial"
"33730",7849,"it must be very important for K. to find Lanz the joiner and thought","The Trial"
"33731",7849,"long about it, naming a joiner who was not called Lanz or giving a name","The Trial"
"33732",7849,"that had some vague similarity with Lanz, or they asked neighbours or","The Trial"
"33733",7849,"accompanied K. to a door a long way away where they thought someone of","The Trial"
"33734",7849,"that sort might live in the back part of the building or where someone","The Trial"
"33735",7849,"would be who could advise K. better than they could themselves. K.","The Trial"
"33736",7849,"eventually had to give up asking if he did not want to be led all round","The Trial"
"33737",7849,"from floor to floor in this way. He regretted his initial plan, which","The Trial"
"33738",7849,"had at first seemed so practical to him. As he reached the fifth floor,","The Trial"
"33739",7849,"he decided to give up the search, took his leave of a friendly, young","The Trial"
"33740",7849,"worker who wanted to lead him on still further and went down the stairs.","The Trial"
"33741",7849,"But then the thought of how much time he was wasting made him cross, he","The Trial"
"33742",7849,"went back again and knocked at the first door on the fifth floor. The","The Trial"
"33743",7849,"first thing he saw in the small room was a large clock on the wall which","The Trial"
"33744",7849,"already showed ten o'clock. ""Is there a joiner called Lanz who lives","The Trial"
"33745",7849,"here?"" he asked. ""Pardon?"" said a young woman with black, shining eyes","The Trial"
"33746",7849,"who was, at that moment, washing children's underclothes in a bucket.","The Trial"
"33747",7849,"She pointed her wet hand towards the open door of the adjoining room.</p>","The Trial"
"33748",7849,"","The Trial"
"33749",7849,"<p>K. thought he had stepped into a meeting. A medium sized, two windowed","The Trial"
"33750",7849,"room was filled with the most diverse crowd of people&mdash;nobody paid any","The Trial"
"33751",7849,"attention to the person who had just entered. Close under its ceiling it","The Trial"
"33752",7849,"was surrounded by a gallery which was also fully occupied and where the","The Trial"
"33753",7849,"people could only stand bent down with their heads and their backs","The Trial"
"33754",7849,"touching the ceiling. K., who found the air too stuffy, stepped out","The Trial"
"33755",7849,"again and said to the young woman, who had probably misunderstood what","The Trial"
"33756",7849,"he had said, ""I asked for a joiner, someone by the name of Lanz."" ""Yes,""","The Trial"
"33757",7849,"said the woman, ""please go on in."" K. would probably not have followed","The Trial"
"33758",7849,"her if the woman had not gone up to him, taken hold of the door handle","The Trial"
"33759",7849,"and said, ""I'll have to close the door after you, no-one else will be","The Trial"
"33760",7849,"allowed in."" ""Very sensible,"" said K., ""but it's too full already."" But","The Trial"
"33761",7849,"then he went back in anyway. He passed through between two men who were","The Trial"
"33762",7849,"talking beside the door&mdash;one of them held both hands far out in front of","The Trial"
"33763",7849,"himself making the movements of counting out money, the other looked him","The Trial"
"33764",7849,"closely in the eyes&mdash;and someone took him by the hand. It was a small,","The Trial"
"33765",7849,"red-faced youth. ""Come in, come in,"" he said. K. let himself be led by","The Trial"
"33766",7849,"him, and it turned out that there was&mdash;surprisingly in a densely packed","The Trial"
"33767",7849,"crowd of people moving to and fro&mdash;a narrow passage which may have been","The Trial"
"33768",7849,"the division between two factions; this idea was reinforced by the fact","The Trial"
"33769",7849,"that in the first few rows to the left and the right of him there was","The Trial"
"33770",7849,"hardly any face looking in his direction, he saw nothing but the backs","The Trial"
"33771",7849,"of people directing their speech and their movements only towards","The Trial"
"33772",7849,"members of their own side. Most of them were dressed in black, in old,","The Trial"
"33773",7849,"long, formal frock coats that hung down loosely around them. These","The Trial"
"33774",7849,"clothes were the only thing that puzzled K., as he would otherwise have","The Trial"
"33775",7849,"taken the whole assembly for a local political meeting.</p>","The Trial"
"33776",7849,"","The Trial"
"33777",7849,"<p>At the other end of the hall where K. had been led there was a little","The Trial"
"33778",7849,"table set at an angle on a very low podium which was as overcrowded as","The Trial"
"33779",7849,"everywhere else, and behind the table, near the edge of the podium, sat","The Trial"
"33780",7849,"a small, fat, wheezing man who was talking with someone behind him. This","The Trial"
"33781",7849,"second man was standing with his legs crossed and his elbows on the","The Trial"
"33782",7849,"backrest of the chair, provoking much laughter. From time to time he","The Trial"
"33783",7849,"threw his arm in the air as if doing a caricature of someone. The youth","The Trial"
"33784",7849,"who was leading K. had some difficulty in reporting to the man. He had","The Trial"
"33785",7849,"already tried twice to tell him something, standing on tiptoe, but","The Trial"
"33786",7849,"without getting the man's attention as he sat there above him. It was","The Trial"
"33787",7849,"only when one of the people up on the podium drew his attention to the","The Trial"
"33788",7849,"youth that the man turned to him and leant down to hear what it was he","The Trial"
"33789",7849,"quietly said. Then he pulled out his watch and quickly looked over at K.","The Trial"
"33790",7849,"""You should have been here one hour and five minutes ago,"" he said. K.","The Trial"
"33791",7849,"was going to give him a reply but had no time to do so, as hardly had","The Trial"
"33792",7849,"the man spoken than a general muttering arose all over the right hand","The Trial"
"33793",7849,"side of the hall. ""You should have been here one hour and five minutes","The Trial"
"33794",7849,"ago,"" the man now repeated, raising his voice this time, and quickly","The Trial"
"33795",7849,"looked round the hall beneath him. The muttering also became immediately","The Trial"
"33796",7849,"louder and, as the man said nothing more, died away only gradually. Now","The Trial"
"33797",7849,"the hall was much quieter than when K. had entered. Only the people up","The Trial"
"33798",7849,"in the gallery had not stopped passing remarks. As far as could be","The Trial"
"33799",7849,"distinguished, up in the half-darkness, dust and haze, they seemed to be","The Trial"
"33800",7849,"less well dressed than those below. Many of them had brought pillows","The Trial"
"33801",7849,"that they had put between their heads and the ceiling so that they would","The Trial"
"33802",7849,"not hurt themselves pressed against it.</p>","The Trial"

"33805",7849,"defend himself for supposedly having come late, and simply said, ""Well","The Trial"
"33806",7849,"maybe I have arrived late, I'm here now."" There followed loud applause,","The Trial"
"33807",7849,"once more from the right hand side of the hall. Easy people to get on","The Trial"
"33808",7849,"your side, thought K., and was bothered only by the quiet from the left","The Trial"
"33809",7849,"hand side which was directly behind him and from which there was","The Trial"
"33810",7849,"applause from only a few individuals. He wondered what he could say to","The Trial"
"33811",7849,"get all of them to support him together or, if that were not possible,","The Trial"
"33812",7849,"to at least get the support of the others for a while.</p>","The Trial"
"33813",7849,"","The Trial"

"33815",7849,"your case""&mdash;there was once more a muttering, but this time it was","The Trial"
"33816",7849,"misleading as the man waved the people's objections aside with his hand","The Trial"
"33817",7849,"and continued&mdash;""I will, however, as an exception, continue with it","The Trial"
"33818",7849,"today. But you should never arrive late like this again. And now, step","The Trial"
"33819",7849,"forward!"" Someone jumped down from the podium so that there would be a","The Trial"
"33820",7849,"place free for K., and K. stepped up onto it. He stood pressed closely","The Trial"
"33821",7849,"against the table, the press of the crowd behind him was so great that","The Trial"

"33826",7849,"on his chair and, after saying a few words to close his discussion with","The Trial"
"33827",7849,"the man behind him, reached for a little note book, the only item on his","The Trial"
"33828",7849,"desk. It was like an old school exercise book and had become quite","The Trial"
"33829",7849,"misshapen from much thumbing. ""Now then,"" said the judge, thumbing","The Trial"
"33830",7849,"through the book. He turned to K. with the tone of someone who knows his","The Trial"
"33831",7849,"facts and said, ""you are a house painter?"" ""No,"" said K., ""I am the","The Trial"
"33832",7849,"chief clerk in a large bank."" This reply was followed by laughter among","The Trial"
"33833",7849,"the right hand faction down in the hall, it was so hearty that K.","The Trial"
"33834",7849,"couldn't stop himself joining in with it. The people supported","The Trial"

"33942",7849,"made quite a mess of this room because of me, although not through any","The Trial"

"33946",7849,"see him now, sitting on the chair belonging to that lady I mentioned&mdash;a","The Trial"
"33947",7849,"picture of dull-witted arrogance. What do you think he answered? What","The Trial"
"33948",7849,"he told me, gentlemen, was basically nothing at all; perhaps he really","The Trial"
"33949",7849,"did know nothing, he had placed me under arrest and was satisfied. In","The Trial"

"34015",7849,"whom nothing better can be said than that they are not as arrogant as","The Trial"

"34021",7849,"innocent people and wage pointless prosecutions against them which, as","The Trial"
"34022",7849,"in my case, lead to no result. How are we to avoid those in office","The Trial"

"34034",7849,"<p>K. was interrupted by a screeching from the far end of the hall, he","The Trial"
"34035",7849,"shaded his eyes to see that far, as the dull light of day made the smoke","The Trial"
"34036",7849,"whitish and hard to see through. It was the washerwoman whom K. had","The Trial"
"34037",7849,"recognised as a likely source of disturbance as soon as she had entered.","The Trial"
"34038",7849,"It was hard to see now whether it was her fault or not. K. could only","The Trial"
"34039",7849,"see that a man had pulled her into a corner by the door and was pressing","The Trial"
"34040",7849,"himself against her. But it was not her who was screaming, but the man,","The Trial"
"34041",7849,"he had opened his mouth wide and looked up at the ceiling. A small","The Trial"
"34042",7849,"circle had formed around the two of them, the visitors near him in the","The Trial"
"34043",7849,"gallery seemed delighted that the serious tone K. had introduced into","The Trial"
"34044",7849,"the gathering had been disturbed in this way. K.'s first thought was to","The Trial"
"34045",7849,"run over there, and he also thought that everyone would want to bring","The Trial"
"34046",7849,"things back into order there or at least to make the pair leave the","The Trial"
"34047",7849,"room, but the first row of people in front of him stayed were they were,","The Trial"
"34048",7849,"no-one moved and no-one let K. through. On the contrary, they stood in","The Trial"
"34049",7849,"his way, old men held out their arms in front of him and a hand from","The Trial"
"34050",7849,"somewhere&mdash;he did not have the time to turn round&mdash;took hold of his","The Trial"
"34051",7849,"collar. K., by this time, had forgotten about the pair, it seemed to him","The Trial"
"34052",7849,"that his freedom was being limited as if his arrest was being taken","The Trial"
"34053",7849,"seriously, and, without any thought for what he was doing, he jumped","The Trial"
"34054",7849,"down from the podium. Now he stood face to face with the crowd. Had he","The Trial"
"34055",7849,"judged the people properly? Had he put too much faith in the effect of","The Trial"
"34056",7849,"his speech? Had they been putting up a pretence all the time he had","The Trial"
"34057",7849,"been speaking, and now that he came to the end and to what must follow,","The Trial"

"34059",7849,"Dark, little eyes flickered here and there, cheeks drooped down like on","The Trial"

"34062",7849,"they were taking hold of their own beards. But underneath those","The Trial"
"34063",7849,"beards&mdash;and this was the real discovery made by K.&mdash;there were badges of","The Trial"
"34064",7849,"various sizes and colours shining on the collars of their coats. As far","The Trial"
"34065",7849,"as he could see, every one of them was wearing one of these badges. All","The Trial"
"34066",7849,"of them belonged to the same group, even though they seemed to be","The Trial"
"34067",7849,"divided to the right and the left of him, and when he suddenly turned","The Trial"
"34068",7849,"round he saw the same badge on the collar of the examining judge who","The Trial"
"34069",7849,"calmly looked down at him with his hands in his lap. ""So,"" called out","The Trial"
"34070",7849,"K., throwing his arms in the air as if this sudden realisation needed","The Trial"
"34071",7849,"more room, ""all of you are working for this organisation, I see now that","The Trial"

"34080",7849,"else that you've actually learned something. And so I wish you good luck","The Trial"

"34082",7849,"the table and, surrounded by a silence caused perhaps by the","The Trial"
"34083",7849,"completeness of their surprise, pushed his way to the exit. However, the","The Trial"
"34084",7849,"examining judge seems to have moved even more quickly than K., as he was","The Trial"
"34085",7849,"waiting for him at the doorway. ""One moment,"" he said. K. stood where he","The Trial"
"34086",7849,"was, but looked at the door with his hand already on its handle rather","The Trial"
"34087",7849,"than at the judge. ""I merely wanted to draw your attention,"" said the","The Trial"
"34088",7849,"judge, ""to something you seem not yet to be aware of: today, you have","The Trial"

"34122",7849,"Sunday. On the podium stood the table exactly as it had been before with","The Trial"

"34127",7849,"and nodded, ""those books must be law books, and that's how this court","The Trial"

"34134",7849,"It was only now that K. noticed that the room, which before had held","The Trial"
"34135",7849,"nothing but a wash-tub, had been fitted out as a living room. The woman","The Trial"
"34136",7849,"saw how surprised he was and said, ""Yes, we're allowed to live here as","The Trial"

"34149",7849,"around me, he's been chasing after me for a long time. I might not be","The Trial"
"34150",7849,"very attractive for most people, but I am for him. I've got no","The Trial"
"34151",7849,"protection from him, even my husband has had to get used to it; if he","The Trial"
"34152",7849,"wants to keep his job he's got to put up with it as that man's a student","The Trial"

"34156",7849,"better here?"" the woman asked slowly, watching him as if she were saying","The Trial"
"34157",7849,"something that could be as dangerous for K. as for herself. ""That's what","The Trial"
"34158",7849,"I thought when I heard you speak, I really liked what you said. Mind","The Trial"

"34161",7849,"she said after a pause, and took hold of K.'s hand. ""Do you believe you","The Trial"
"34162",7849,"really will be able to make things better?"" K. smiled and twisted his","The Trial"
"34163",7849,"hand round a little in her soft hands. ""It's really not my job to make","The Trial"
"34164",7849,"things better here, as you put it,"" he said, ""and if you said that to","The Trial"
"34165",7849,"the examining judge he would laugh at you or punish you for it. I really","The Trial"
"34166",7849,"would not have become involved in this matter if I could have helped it,","The Trial"
"34167",7849,"and I would have lost no sleep worrying about how this court needs to be","The Trial"

"34169",7849,"under arrest&mdash;it forces me to take some action, and to do so for my own","The Trial"
"34170",7849,"sake. However, if I can be of some service to you in the process I will,","The Trial"
"34171",7849,"of course, be glad to do so. And I will be glad to do so not only for","The Trial"
"34172",7849,"the sake of charity but also because you can be of some help to me.""","The Trial"
"34173",7849,"""How could I help you, then?"" said the woman. ""You could, for example,","The Trial"
"34174",7849,"show me the books on the table there."" ""Yes, certainly,"" the woman","The Trial"
"34175",7849,"cried, and pulled K. along behind her as she rushed to them. The books","The Trial"
"34176",7849,"were old and well worn, the cover of one of them had nearly broken","The Trial"
"34177",7849,"through in its middle, and it was held together with a few threads.","The Trial"
"34178",7849,"""Everything is so dirty here,"" said K., shaking his head, and before he","The Trial"
"34179",7849,"could pick the books up the woman wiped some of the dust off with her","The Trial"
"34180",7849,"apron. K. took hold of the book that lay on top and threw it open, an","The Trial"
"34181",7849,"indecent picture appeared. A man and a woman sat naked on a sofa, the","The Trial"
"34182",7849,"base intent of whoever drew it was easy to see but he had been so","The Trial"
"34183",7849,"grossly lacking in skill that all that anyone could really make out were","The Trial"
"34184",7849,"the man and the woman who dominated the picture with their bodies,","The Trial"
"34185",7849,"sitting in overly upright postures that created a false perspective and","The Trial"
"34186",7849,"made it difficult for them to approach each other. K. didn't thumb","The Trial"
"34187",7849,"through that book any more, but just threw open the next one at its","The Trial"
"34188",7849,"title page, it was a novel with the title, What Grete Suffered from her","The Trial"
"34189",7849,"Husband, Hans. ""So this is the sort of law book they study here,"" said","The Trial"
"34190",7849,"K., ""this is the sort of person sitting in judgement over me."" ""I can","The Trial"
"34191",7849,"help you,"" said the woman, ""would you like me to?"" ""Could you really do","The Trial"
"34192",7849,"that without placing yourself in danger? You did say earlier on that","The Trial"
"34193",7849,"your husband is wholly dependent on his superiors."" ""I still want to","The Trial"
"34194",7849,"help you,"" said the woman, ""come over here, we've got to talk about it.","The Trial"
"34195",7849,"Don't say any more about what danger I'm in, I only fear danger where I","The Trial"
"34196",7849,"want to fear it. Come over here."" She pointed to the podium and invited","The Trial"
"34197",7849,"him to sit down on the step with her. ""You've got lovely dark eyes,"" she","The Trial"
"34198",7849,"said after they had sat down, looking up into K.'s face, ""people say","The Trial"
"34199",7849,"I've got nice eyes too, but yours are much nicer. It was the first thing","The Trial"
"34200",7849,"I noticed when you first came here. That's even why I came in here, into","The Trial"
"34201",7849,"the assembly room, afterwards, I'd never normally do that, I'm not","The Trial"
"34202",7849,"really even allowed to."" So that's what all this is about, thought K.,","The Trial"
"34203",7849,"she's offering herself to me, she's as degenerate as everything else","The Trial"
"34204",7849,"around here, she's had enough of the court officials, which is","The Trial"
"34205",7849,"understandable I suppose, and so she approaches any stranger and makes","The Trial"
"34206",7849,"compliments about his eyes. With that, K. stood up in silence as if he","The Trial"
"34207",7849,"had spoken his thoughts out loud and thus explained his action to the","The Trial"
"34208",7849,"woman. ""I don't think you can be of any assistance to me,"" he said, ""to","The Trial"
"34209",7849,"be of any real assistance you would need to be in contact with high","The Trial"
"34210",7849,"officials. But I'm sure you only know the lower employees, and there are","The Trial"
"34211",7849,"crowds of them milling about here. I'm sure you're very familiar with","The Trial"
"34212",7849,"them and could achieve a great deal through them, I've no doubt of that,","The Trial"
"34213",7849,"but the most that could be done through them would have no bearing at","The Trial"
"34214",7849,"all on the final outcome of the trial. You, on the other hand, would","The Trial"
"34215",7849,"lose some of your friends as a result, and I have no wish of that. Carry","The Trial"
"34216",7849,"on with these people in the same way as you have been, as it does seem","The Trial"
"34217",7849,"to me to be something you cannot do without. I have no regrets in saying","The Trial"
"34218",7849,"this as, in return for your compliment to me, I also find you rather","The Trial"
"34219",7849,"attractive, especially when you look at me as sadly as you are now,","The Trial"
"34220",7849,"although you really have no reason to do so. You belong to the people I","The Trial"
"34221",7849,"have to combat, and you're very comfortable among them, you're even in","The Trial"
"34222",7849,"love with the student, or if you don't love him you do at least prefer","The Trial"
"34223",7849,"him to your husband. It's easy to see that from what you've been","The Trial"
"34224",7849,"saying."" ""No!"" she shouted, remained sitting where she was and grasped","The Trial"
"34225",7849,"K.'s hand, which he failed to pull away fast enough. ""You can't go away","The Trial"
"34226",7849,"now, you can't go away when you've misjudged me like that! Are you","The Trial"
"34227",7849,"really capable of going away now? Am I really so worthless that you","The Trial"
"34228",7849,"won't even do me the favour of staying a little bit longer?"" ""You","The Trial"
"34229",7849,"misunderstand me,"" said K., sitting back down, ""if it's really important","The Trial"
"34230",7849,"to you for me to stay here then I'll be glad to do so, I have plenty of","The Trial"
"34231",7849,"time, I came here thinking there would be a trial taking place. All I","The Trial"
"34232",7849,"meant with what I said just now was to ask you not to do anything on my","The Trial"
"34233",7849,"behalf in the proceedings against me. But even that is nothing for you","The Trial"
"34234",7849,"to worry about when you consider that there's nothing hanging on the","The Trial"
"34235",7849,"outcome of this trial, and that, whatever the verdict, I will just laugh","The Trial"
"34236",7849,"at it. And that's even presupposing it ever even reaches any conclusion,","The Trial"
"34237",7849,"which I very much doubt. I think it's much more likely that the court","The Trial"
"34238",7849,"officials will be too lazy, too forgetful, or even too fearful ever to","The Trial"
"34239",7849,"continue with these proceedings and that they will soon be abandoned if","The Trial"
"34240",7849,"they haven't been abandoned already. It's even possible that they will","The Trial"
"34241",7849,"pretend to be carrying on with the trial in the hope of receiving a","The Trial"
"34242",7849,"large bribe, although I can tell you now that that will be quite in vain","The Trial"
"34243",7849,"as I pay bribes to no-one. Perhaps one favour you could do me would be","The Trial"
"34244",7849,"to tell the examining judge, or anyone else who likes to spread","The Trial"
"34245",7849,"important news, that I will never be induced to pay any sort of bribe","The Trial"
"34246",7849,"through any stratagem of theirs&mdash;and I'm sure they have many stratagems","The Trial"
"34247",7849,"at their disposal. There is no prospect of that, you can tell them that","The Trial"
"34248",7849,"quite openly. And what's more, I expect they have already noticed","The Trial"
"34249",7849,"themselves, or even if they haven't, this affair is really not so","The Trial"
"34250",7849,"important to me as they think. Those gentlemen would only save some work","The Trial"
"34251",7849,"for themselves, or at least some unpleasantness for me, which, however,","The Trial"
"34252",7849,"I am glad to endure if I know that each piece of unpleasantness for me","The Trial"
"34253",7849,"is a blow against them. And I will make quite sure it is a blow against","The Trial"
"34254",7849,"them. Do you actually know the judge?"" ""Course I do,"" said the woman,","The Trial"
"34255",7849,"""he was the first one I thought of when I offered to help you. I didn't","The Trial"
"34256",7849,"know he's only a minor official, but if you say so it must be true. Mind","The Trial"
"34257",7849,"you, I still think the report he gives to his superiors must have some","The Trial"
"34258",7849,"influence. And he writes so many reports. You say these officials are","The Trial"
"34259",7849,"lazy, but they're certainly not all lazy, especially this examining","The Trial"
"34260",7849,"judge, he writes ever such a lot. Last Sunday, for instance, that","The Trial"
"34261",7849,"session went on till the evening. Everyone had gone, but the examining","The Trial"
"34262",7849,"judge, he stayed in the hall, I had to bring him a lamp in, all I had","The Trial"
"34263",7849,"was a little kitchen lamp but he was very satisfied with it and started","The Trial"
"34264",7849,"to write straight away. Meantime my husband arrived, he always has the","The Trial"
"34265",7849,"day off on Sundays, we got the furniture back in and got our room sorted","The Trial"
"34266",7849,"out and then a few of the neighbours came, we sat and talked for a bit","The Trial"
"34267",7849,"by a candle, in short, we forgot all about the examining judge and went","The Trial"
"34268",7849,"to bed. All of a sudden in the night, it must have been quite late in","The Trial"
"34269",7849,"the night, I wakes up, next to the bed, there's the examining judge","The Trial"
"34270",7849,"shading the lamp with his hand so that there's no light from it falls on","The Trial"
"34271",7849,"my husband, he didn't need to be as careful as that, the way my husband","The Trial"
"34272",7849,"sleeps the light wouldn't have woken him up anyway. I was quite shocked","The Trial"
"34273",7849,"and nearly screamed, but the judge was very friendly, warned me I should","The Trial"
"34274",7849,"be careful, he whispered to me he's been writing all this time, and now","The Trial"
"34275",7849,"he's brought me the lamp back, and he'll never forget how I looked when","The Trial"
"34276",7849,"he found me there asleep. What I mean, with all this, I just wanted to","The Trial"
"34277",7849,"tell you how the examining judge really does write lots of reports,","The Trial"
"34278",7849,"especially about you as questioning you was definitely one of the main","The Trial"
"34279",7849,"things on the agenda that Sunday. If he writes reports as long as that","The Trial"
"34280",7849,"they must be of some importance. And besides all that, you can see from","The Trial"
"34281",7849,"what happened that the examining judge is after me, and it's right now,","The Trial"
"34282",7849,"when he's first begun to notice me, that I can have a lot of influence","The Trial"
"34283",7849,"on him. And I've got other proof I mean a lot to him, too. Yesterday, he","The Trial"
"34284",7849,"sent that student to me, the one he really trusts and who he works with,","The Trial"
"34285",7849,"he sent him with a present for me, silk stockings. He said it was","The Trial"
"34286",7849,"because I clear up in the courtroom but that's only a pretence, that","The Trial"
"34287",7849,"job's no more than what I'm supposed to do, it's what my husband gets","The Trial"
"34288",7849,"paid for. Nice stockings, they are, look,""&mdash;she stretched out her leg,","The Trial"
"34289",7849,"drew her skirt up to her knee and looked, herself, at the","The Trial"

"34291",7849,"really.""</p>","The Trial"
"34292",7849,"","The Trial"
"34293",7849,"<p>She suddenly interrupted herself and lay her hand on K.'s as if she","The Trial"
"34294",7849,"wanted to calm him down, and whispered, ""Be quiet, Berthold is watching","The Trial"
"34295",7849,"us."" K. slowly looked up. In the doorway to the courtroom stood a young","The Trial"
"34296",7849,"man, he was short, his legs were not quite straight, and he continually","The Trial"
"34297",7849,"moved his finger round in a short, thin, red beard with which he hoped","The Trial"
"34298",7849,"to make himself look dignified. K. looked at him with some curiosity, he","The Trial"
"34299",7849,"was the first student he had ever met of the unfamiliar discipline of","The Trial"
"34300",7849,"jurisprudence, face to face at least, a man who would even most likely","The Trial"
"34301",7849,"attain high office one day. The student, in contrast, seemed to take no","The Trial"
"34302",7849,"notice of K. at all, he merely withdrew his finger from his beard long","The Trial"
"34303",7849,"enough to beckon to the woman and went over to the window, the woman","The Trial"
"34304",7849,"leant over to K. and whispered, ""Don't be cross with me, please don't,","The Trial"
"34305",7849,"and please don't think ill of me either, I've got to go to him now, to","The Trial"
"34306",7849,"this horrible man, just look at his bent legs. But I'll come straight","The Trial"
"34307",7849,"back and then I'll go with you if you'll take me, I'll go wherever you","The Trial"
"34308",7849,"want, you can do whatever you like with me, I'll be happy if I can be","The Trial"
"34309",7849,"away from here for as long as possible, it'd be best if I could get away","The Trial"
"34310",7849,"from here for good."" She stroked K.'s hand once more, jumped up and ran","The Trial"
"34311",7849,"over to the window. Before he realised it, K. grasped for her hand but","The Trial"
"34312",7849,"failed to catch it. He really was attracted to the woman, and even after","The Trial"
"34313",7849,"thinking hard about it could find no good reason why he should not give","The Trial"
"34314",7849,"in to her allure. It briefly crossed his mind that the woman meant to","The Trial"
"34315",7849,"entrap him on behalf of the court, but that was an objection he had no","The Trial"
"34316",7849,"difficulty in fending off. In what way could she entrap him? Was he not","The Trial"
"34317",7849,"still free, so free that he could crush the entire court whenever he","The Trial"
"34318",7849,"wanted, at least where it concerned him? Could he not have that much","The Trial"
"34319",7849,"confidence in himself? And her offer of help sounded sincere, and maybe","The Trial"
"34320",7849,"it wasn't quite worthless. And maybe there was no better revenge against","The Trial"
"34321",7849,"the examining judge and his cronies than to take this woman from him and","The Trial"

"34327",7849,"and to him alone. Once he had settled his thoughts towards the woman in","The Trial"
"34328",7849,"this way, he began to find the quiet conversation at the window was","The Trial"
"34329",7849,"taking too long, he rapped on the podium with his knuckles, and then","The Trial"
"34330",7849,"even with his fist. The student briefly looked away from the woman to","The Trial"
"34331",7849,"glance at K. over his shoulder but did allow himself to be disturbed, in","The Trial"
"34332",7849,"fact he even pressed himself close to the woman and put his arms around","The Trial"
"34333",7849,"her. She dropped her head down low as if listening to him carefully, as","The Trial"
"34334",7849,"she did so he kissed her right on the neck, hardly even interrupting","The Trial"
"34335",7849,"what he was saying. K. saw this as confirmation of the tyranny the","The Trial"
"34336",7849,"student held over the woman and which she had already complained about,","The Trial"
"34337",7849,"he stood up and walked up and down the room. Glancing sideways at the","The Trial"
"34338",7849,"student, he wondered what would be the quickest possible way to get rid","The Trial"
"34339",7849,"of him, and so it was not unwelcome to him when the student, clearly","The Trial"
"34340",7849,"disturbed by K.'s to-ing and fro-ing which K. had now developed into a","The Trial"
"34341",7849,"stamping up and down, said to him, ""You don't have to stay here, you","The Trial"
"34342",7849,"know, if you're getting impatient. You could have gone earlier, no-one","The Trial"
"34343",7849,"would have missed you. In fact you should have gone, you should have","The Trial"
"34344",7849,"left as quickly as possible as soon as I got here."" This comment could","The Trial"
"34345",7849,"have caused all possible rage to break out between them, but K. also","The Trial"
"34346",7849,"bore in mind that this was a prospective court official speaking to a","The Trial"
"34347",7849,"disfavoured defendant, and he might well have been taking pride in","The Trial"
"34348",7849,"speaking in this way. K. remained standing quite close to him and said","The Trial"
"34349",7849,"with a smile, ""You're quite right, I am impatient, but the easiest way","The Trial"
"34350",7849,"to settle this impatience would be if you left us. On the other hand,","The Trial"
"34351",7849,"if you've come here to study&mdash;you are a student, I hear&mdash;I'll be quite","The Trial"
"34352",7849,"happy to leave the room to you and go away with the woman. I'm sure","The Trial"
"34353",7849,"you'll still have a lot of study to do before you're made into a judge.","The Trial"
"34354",7849,"It's true that I'm still not all that familiar with your branch of","The Trial"
"34355",7849,"jurisprudence but I take it it involves a lot more than speaking","The Trial"
"34356",7849,"roughly&mdash;and I see you have no shame in doing that extremely well."" ""He","The Trial"
"34357",7849,"shouldn't have been allowed to move about so freely,"" said the student,","The Trial"
"34358",7849,"as if he wanted to give the woman an explanation for K.'s insults, ""that","The Trial"
"34359",7849,"was a mistake. I've told the examining judge so. He should at least have","The Trial"
"34360",7849,"been detained in his room between hearings. Sometimes it's impossible to","The Trial"
"34361",7849,"understand what the judge thinks he's doing."" ""You're wasting your","The Trial"
"34362",7849,"breath,"" said K., then he reached his hand out towards the woman and","The Trial"
"34363",7849,"said, ""come with me."" ""So that's it,"" said the student, ""oh no, you're","The Trial"
"34364",7849,"not going to get her,"" and with a strength you would not have expected","The Trial"
"34365",7849,"from him, he glanced tenderly at her, lifted her up on one arm and, his","The Trial"
"34366",7849,"back bent under the weight, ran with her to the door. In this way he","The Trial"
"34367",7849,"showed, unmistakably, that he was to some extent afraid of K., but he","The Trial"
"34368",7849,"nonetheless dared to provoke him still further by stroking and squeezing","The Trial"
"34369",7849,"the woman's arm with his free hand. K. ran the few steps up to him, but","The Trial"
"34370",7849,"when he had reached him and was about to take hold of him and, if","The Trial"
"34371",7849,"necessary, throttle him, the woman said, ""It's no good, it's the","The Trial"
"34372",7849,"examining judge who's sent for me, I daren't go with you, this little","The Trial"
"34373",7849,"bastard ..."" and here she ran her hand over the student's face, ""this","The Trial"
"34374",7849,"little bastard won't let me."" ""And you don't want to be set free!""","The Trial"
"34375",7849,"shouted K., laying his hand on the student's shoulder, who then snapped","The Trial"
"34376",7849,"at it with his teeth. ""No!"" shouted the woman, pushing K. away with both","The Trial"
"34377",7849,"hands, ""no, no don't do that, what d'you think you're doing? That'd be","The Trial"
"34378",7849,"the end of me. Let go of him, please just let go of him. He's only","The Trial"
"34379",7849,"carrying out the judge's orders, he's carrying me to him."" ""Let him take","The Trial"
"34380",7849,"you then, and I want to see nothing more of you,"" said K., enraged by","The Trial"
"34381",7849,"his disappointment and giving the student a thump in the back so that he","The Trial"
"34382",7849,"briefly stumbled and then, glad that he had not fallen, immediately","The Trial"
"34383",7849,"jumped up all the higher with his burden. K. followed them slowly. He","The Trial"
"34384",7849,"realised that this was the first unambiguous setback he had suffered","The Trial"
"34385",7849,"from these people. It was of course nothing to worry about, he accepted","The Trial"
"34386",7849,"the setback only because he was looking for a fight. If he stayed at","The Trial"
"34387",7849,"home and carried on with his normal life he would be a thousand times","The Trial"
"34388",7849,"superior to these people and could get any of them out of his way just","The Trial"
"34389",7849,"with a kick. And he imagined the most laughable scene possible as an","The Trial"
"34390",7849,"example of this, if this contemptible student, this inflated child, this","The Trial"
"34391",7849,"knock-kneed redbeard, if he were kneeling at Elsa's bed wringing his","The Trial"
"34392",7849,"hands and begging for forgiveness. K. so enjoyed imagining this scene","The Trial"
"34393",7849,"that he decided to take the student along to Elsa with him if ever he","The Trial"
"34394",7849,"should get the opportunity.</p>","The Trial"
"34395",7849,"","The Trial"
"34396",7849,"<p>K. was curious to see where the woman would be taken and he hurried over","The Trial"
"34397",7849,"to the door, the student was not likely to carry her through the streets","The Trial"
"34398",7849,"on his arm. It turned out that the journey was far shorter. Directly","The Trial"
"34399",7849,"opposite the flat there was a narrow flight of wooden steps which","The Trial"
"34400",7849,"probably led up to the attic, they turned as they went so that it was","The Trial"
"34401",7849,"not possible to see where they ended. The student carried the woman up","The Trial"
"34402",7849,"these steps, and after the exertions of running with her he was soon","The Trial"
"34403",7849,"groaning and moving very slowly. The woman waved down at K. and by","The Trial"
"34404",7849,"raising and lowering her shoulders she tried to show that she was an","The Trial"
"34405",7849,"innocent party in this abduction, although the gesture did not show a","The Trial"
"34406",7849,"lot of regret. K. watched her without expression like a stranger, he","The Trial"
"34407",7849,"wanted to show neither that he was disappointed nor that he would easily","The Trial"
"34408",7849,"get over his disappointment.</p>","The Trial"
"34409",7849,"","The Trial"
"34410",7849,"<p>The two of them had disappeared, but K. remained standing in the","The Trial"
"34411",7849,"doorway. He had to accept that the woman had not only cheated him but","The Trial"
"34412",7849,"that she had also lied to him when she said she was being taken to the","The Trial"
"34413",7849,"examining judge. The examining judge certainly wouldn't be sitting and","The Trial"
"34414",7849,"waiting in the attic. The wooden stairs would explain nothing to him","The Trial"
"34415",7849,"however long he stared at them. Then K. noticed a small piece of paper","The Trial"
"34416",7849,"next to them, went across to it and read, in a childish and unpractised","The Trial"
"34417",7849,"hand, ""Entrance to the Court Offices"". Were the court offices here, in","The Trial"
"34418",7849,"the attic of this tenement, then? If that was how they were","The Trial"
"34419",7849,"accommodated it did not attract much respect, and it was some comfort","The Trial"
"34420",7849,"for the accused to realise how little money this court had at its","The Trial"
"34421",7849,"disposal if it had to locate its offices in a place where the tenants of","The Trial"
"34422",7849,"the building, who were themselves among the poorest of people, would","The Trial"
"34423",7849,"throw their unneeded junk. On the other hand, it was possible that the","The Trial"
"34424",7849,"officials had enough money but that they squandered it on themselves","The Trial"
"34425",7849,"rather than use it for the court's purposes. Going by K.'s experience of","The Trial"
"34426",7849,"them so far, that even seemed probable, except that if the court were","The Trial"
"34427",7849,"allowed to decay in that way it would not just humiliate the accused but","The Trial"
"34428",7849,"also give him more encouragement than if the court were simply in a","The Trial"
"34429",7849,"state of poverty. K. also now understood that the court was ashamed to","The Trial"
"34430",7849,"summon those it accused to the attic of this building for the initial","The Trial"
"34431",7849,"hearing, and why it preferred to impose upon them in their own homes.","The Trial"
"34432",7849,"What a position it was that K. found himself in, compared with the judge","The Trial"
"34433",7849,"sitting up in the attic! K., at the bank, had a big office with an","The Trial"
"34434",7849,"ante-room, and had an enormous window through which he could look down","The Trial"
"34435",7849,"at the activity in the square. It was true, though, that he had no","The Trial"
"34436",7849,"secondary income from bribes and fraud, and he couldn't tell a servant","The Trial"
"34437",7849,"to bring him a woman up to the office on his arm. K., however, was quite","The Trial"
"34438",7849,"willing to do without such things, in this life at least. K. was still","The Trial"
"34439",7849,"looking at the notice when a man came up the stairs, looked through the","The Trial"
"34440",7849,"open door into the living room where it was also possible to see the","The Trial"
"34441",7849,"courtroom, and finally asked K. whether he had just seen a woman there.","The Trial"
"34442",7849,"""You're the court usher, aren't you?"" asked K. ""That's right,"" said the","The Trial"
"34443",7849,"man, ""oh, yes, you're defendant K., I recognise you now as well. Nice to","The Trial"
"34444",7849,"see you here."" And he offered K. his hand, which was far from what K.","The Trial"
"34445",7849,"had expected. And when K. said nothing, he added, ""There's no court","The Trial"
"34446",7849,"session planned for today, though."" ""I know that,"" said K. as he looked","The Trial"
"34447",7849,"at the usher's civilian coat which, beside its ordinary buttons,","The Trial"
"34448",7849,"displayed two gilded ones as the only sign of his office and seemed to","The Trial"
"34449",7849,"have been taken from an old army officer's coat. ""I was speaking with","The Trial"
"34450",7849,"your wife a little while ago. She is no longer here. The student has","The Trial"
"34451",7849,"carried her off to the examining judge."" ""Listen to this,"" said the","The Trial"
"34452",7849,"usher, ""they're always carrying her away from me. It's Sunday today, and","The Trial"
"34453",7849,"it's not part of my job to do any work today, but they send me off with","The Trial"
"34454",7849,"some message which isn't even necessary just to get me away from here.","The Trial"
"34455",7849,"What they do is they send me off not too far away so that I can still","The Trial"
"34456",7849,"hope to get back on time if I really hurry. So off I go running as fast","The Trial"
"34457",7849,"as I can, shout the message through the crack in the door of the office","The Trial"
"34458",7849,"I've been sent to, so out of breath they'll hardly be able to understand","The Trial"
"34459",7849,"it, run back here again, but the student's been even faster than I","The Trial"
"34460",7849,"have&mdash;well he's got less far to go, he's only got to run down the steps.","The Trial"
"34461",7849,"If I wasn't so dependent on them I'd have squashed the student against","The Trial"
"34462",7849,"the wall here a long time ago. Right here, next to the sign. I'm always","The Trial"
"34463",7849,"dreaming of doing that. Just here, just above the floor, that's where","The Trial"
"34464",7849,"he's crushed onto the wall, his arms stretched out, his fingers spread","The Trial"
"34465",7849,"apart, his crooked legs twisted round into a circle and blood squirted","The Trial"
"34466",7849,"out all around him. It's only ever been a dream so far, though."" ""Is","The Trial"
"34467",7849,"there nothing else you do?"" asked K. with a smile. ""Nothing that I know","The Trial"
"34468",7849,"of,"" said the usher. ""And it's going to get even worse now, up till now","The Trial"
"34469",7849,"he's only been carrying her off for himself, now he's started carrying","The Trial"
"34470",7849,"her off for the judge and all, just like I'd always said he would.""","The Trial"
"34471",7849,"""Does your wife, then, not share some of the responsibility?"" asked K.","The Trial"
"34472",7849,"He had to force himself as he asked this question, as he, too, felt so","The Trial"
"34473",7849,"jealous now. ""Course she does,"" said the usher, ""it's more her fault","The Trial"
"34474",7849,"than theirs. It was her who attached herself to him. All he did, he just","The Trial"
"34475",7849,"chases after any woman. There's five flats in this block alone where","The Trial"
"34476",7849,"he's been thrown out after working his way in there. And my wife is the","The Trial"
"34477",7849,"best looking woman in the whole building, but it's me who's not even","The Trial"
"34478",7849,"allowed to defend himself."" ""If that's how things are, then there's","The Trial"
"34479",7849,"nothing that can be done,"" said K. ""Well why not?"" asked the usher.","The Trial"
"34480",7849,"""He's a coward that student, if he wants to lay a finger on my wife all","The Trial"
"34481",7849,"you'd have to do is give him such a good hiding he'd never dare do it","The Trial"
"34482",7849,"again. But I'm not allowed to do that, and nobody else is going to do me","The Trial"
"34483",7849,"the favour as they're all afraid of his power. The only one who could do","The Trial"
"34484",7849,"it is a man like you."" ""What, how could I do it?"" asked K. in","The Trial"
"34485",7849,"astonishment. ""Well you're facing a charge, aren't you,"" said the usher.","The Trial"
"34486",7849,"""Yes, but that's all the more reason for me to be afraid. Even if he has","The Trial"
"34487",7849,"no influence on the outcome of the trial he probably has some on the","The Trial"
"34488",7849,"initial examination."" ""Yes, exactly,"" said the usher, as if K.'s view","The Trial"
"34489",7849,"had been just as correct as his own. ""Only we don't usually get any","The Trial"
"34490",7849,"trials heard here with no hope at all."" ""I am not of the same opinion,""","The Trial"
"34491",7849,"said K., ""although that ought not to prevent me from dealing with the","The Trial"
"34492",7849,"student if the opportunity arises."" ""I would be very grateful to you,""","The Trial"
"34493",7849,"said the usher of the court, somewhat formally, not really seeming to","The Trial"
"34494",7849,"believe that his highest wish could be fulfilled. ""Perhaps,"" continued","The Trial"
"34495",7849,"K., ""perhaps there are some other officials of yours here, perhaps all","The Trial"
"34496",7849,"of them, who would deserve the same."" ""Oh yes, yes,"" said the usher, as","The Trial"
"34497",7849,"if this was a matter of course. Then he looked at K. trustingly which,","The Trial"
"34498",7849,"despite all his friendliness, he had not done until then, and added,","The Trial"
"34499",7849,"""they're always rebelling."" But the conversation seemed to have become a","The Trial"
"34500",7849,"little uncomfortable for him, as he broke it off by saying, ""now I have","The Trial"
"34501",7849,"to report to the office. Would you like to come with me?"" ""There's","The Trial"
"34502",7849,"nothing for me to do there,"" said K. ""You'd be able to have a look at","The Trial"
"34503",7849,"it. No-one will take any notice of you."" ""Is it worth seeing then?""","The Trial"
"34504",7849,"asked K. hesitatingly, although he felt very keen to go with him.","The Trial"
"34505",7849,"""Well,"" said the usher, ""I thought you'd be interested in it."" ""Alright","The Trial"
"34506",7849,"then,"" said K. finally, ""I'll come with you."" And, quicker than the","The Trial"
"34507",7849,"usher himself, he ran up the steps.</p>","The Trial"
"34508",7849,"","The Trial"
"34509",7849,"<p>At the entrance he nearly fell over, as behind the door there was","The Trial"
"34510",7849,"another step. ""They don't show much concern for the public,"" he said.","The Trial"
"34511",7849,"""They don't show any concern at all,"" said the usher, ""just look at the","The Trial"
"34512",7849,"waiting room here."" It consisted of a long corridor from which roughly","The Trial"
"34513",7849,"made doors led out to the separate departments of the attic. There was","The Trial"
"34514",7849,"no direct source of light but it was not entirely dark as many of the","The Trial"
"34515",7849,"departments, instead of solid walls, had just wooden bars reaching up to","The Trial"
"34516",7849,"the ceiling to separate them from the corridor. The light made its way","The Trial"
"34517",7849,"in through them, and it was also possible to see individual officials","The Trial"
"34518",7849,"through them as they sat writing at their desks or stood up at the","The Trial"
"34519",7849,"wooden frameworks and watched the people on the corridor through the","The Trial"
"34520",7849,"gaps. There were only a few people in the corridor, probably because it","The Trial"
"34521",7849,"was Sunday. They were not very impressive. They sat, equally spaced, on","The Trial"
"34522",7849,"two rows of long wooden benches which had been placed along both sides","The Trial"
"34523",7849,"of the corridor. All of them were carelessly dressed although the","The Trial"
"34524",7849,"expressions on their faces, their bearing, the style of their beards and","The Trial"
"34525",7849,"many details which were hard to identify showed that they belonged to","The Trial"
"34526",7849,"the upper classes. There were no coat hooks for them to use, and so they","The Trial"
"34527",7849,"had placed their hats under the bench, each probably having followed the","The Trial"
"34528",7849,"example of the others. When those who were sitting nearest the door saw","The Trial"
"34529",7849,"K. and the usher of the court they stood up to greet them, and when the","The Trial"
"34530",7849,"others saw that, they also thought they had to greet them, so that as","The Trial"
"34531",7849,"the two of them went by all the people there stood up. None of them","The Trial"
"34532",7849,"stood properly upright, their backs were bowed, their knees bent, they","The Trial"
"34533",7849,"stood like beggars on the street. K. waited for the usher, who was","The Trial"
"34534",7849,"following just behind him. ""They must all be very dispirited,"" he said.","The Trial"
"34535",7849,"""Yes,"" said the usher, ""they are the accused, everyone you see here has","The Trial"
"34536",7849,"been accused."" ""Really!"" said K. ""They're colleagues of mine then."" And","The Trial"
"34537",7849,"he turned to the nearest one, a tall, thin man with hair that was nearly","The Trial"
"34538",7849,"grey. ""What is it you are waiting for here?"" asked K., politely, but the","The Trial"
"34539",7849,"man was startled at being spoken to unexpectedly, which was all the more","The Trial"
"34540",7849,"pitiful to see because the man clearly had some experience of the world","The Trial"
"34541",7849,"and elsewhere would certainly have been able to show his superiority and","The Trial"
"34542",7849,"would not have easily given up the advantage he had acquired. Here,","The Trial"
"34543",7849,"though, he did not know what answer to give to such a simple question","The Trial"
"34544",7849,"and looked round at the others as if they were under some obligation to","The Trial"
"34545",7849,"help him, and as if no-one could expect any answer from him without this","The Trial"
"34546",7849,"help. Then the usher of the court stepped forward to him and, in order","The Trial"
"34547",7849,"to calm him down and raise his spirits, said, ""The gentleman here's only","The Trial"
"34548",7849,"asking what it is you're waiting for. You can give him an answer."" The","The Trial"
"34549",7849,"voice of the usher was probably familiar to him, and had a better effect","The Trial"
"34550",7849,"than K.'s. ""I'm ... I'm waiting...."" he began, and then came to a halt.","The Trial"
"34551",7849,"He had clearly chosen this beginning so that he could give a precise","The Trial"
"34552",7849,"answer to the question, but now he didn't know how to continue. Some of","The Trial"
"34553",7849,"the others waiting had come closer and stood round the group, the usher","The Trial"
"34554",7849,"of the court said to them, ""Get out the way, keep the gangway free.""","The Trial"
"34555",7849,"They moved back slightly, but not as far as where they had been sitting","The Trial"
"34556",7849,"before. In the meantime, the man whom K. had first approached had pulled","The Trial"
"34557",7849,"himself together and even answered him with a smile. ""A month ago I made","The Trial"
"34558",7849,"some applications for evidence to be heard in my case, and I'm waiting","The Trial"
"34559",7849,"for it to be settled."" ""You certainly seem to be going to a lot of","The Trial"
"34560",7849,"effort,"" said K. ""Yes,"" said the man, ""it is my affair after all."" ""Not","The Trial"
"34561",7849,"everyone thinks the same way as you do,"" said K. ""I've been indicted as","The Trial"
"34562",7849,"well but I swear on my soul that I've neither submitted evidence nor","The Trial"
"34563",7849,"done anything else of the sort. Do you really think that's necessary?""","The Trial"
"34564",7849,"""I don't really know, exactly,"" said the man, once more totally unsure","The Trial"
"34565",7849,"of himself; he clearly thought K. was joking with him and therefore","The Trial"
"34566",7849,"probably thought it best to repeat his earlier answer in order to avoid","The Trial"
"34567",7849,"making any new mistakes. With K. looking at him impatiently, he just","The Trial"
"34568",7849,"said, ""as far as I'm concerned, I've applied to have this evidence","The Trial"
"34569",7849,"heard."" ""Perhaps you don't believe I've been indicted?"" asked K. ""Oh,","The Trial"
"34570",7849,"please, I certainly do,"" said the man, stepping slightly to one side,","The Trial"
"34571",7849,"but there was more anxiety in his answer than belief. ""You don't believe","The Trial"
"34572",7849,"me then?"" asked K., and took hold of his arm, unconsciously prompted by","The Trial"
"34573",7849,"the man's humble demeanour, and as if he wanted to force him to believe","The Trial"
"34574",7849,"him. But he did not want to hurt the man and had only taken hold of him","The Trial"
"34575",7849,"very lightly. Nonetheless, the man cried out as if K. had grasped him","The Trial"
"34576",7849,"not with two fingers but with red hot tongs. Shouting in this ridiculous","The Trial"
"34577",7849,"way finally made K. tired of him, if he didn't believe he was indicted","The Trial"
"34578",7849,"then so much the better; maybe he even thought K. was a judge. And","The Trial"
"34579",7849,"before leaving, he held him a lot harder, shoved him back onto the bench","The Trial"
"34580",7849,"and walked on. ""These defendants are so sensitive, most of them,"" said","The Trial"
"34581",7849,"the usher of the court. Almost all of those who had been waiting had now","The Trial"
"34582",7849,"assembled around the man who, by now, had stopped shouting and they","The Trial"
"34583",7849,"seemed to be asking him lots of precise questions about the incident. K.","The Trial"
"34584",7849,"was approached by a security guard, identifiable mainly by his sword, of","The Trial"
"34585",7849,"which the scabbard seemed to be made of aluminium. This greatly","The Trial"
"34586",7849,"surprised K., and he reached out for it with his hand. The guard had","The Trial"
"34587",7849,"come because of the shouting and asked what had been happening. The","The Trial"
"34588",7849,"usher of the court said a few words to try and calm him down but the","The Trial"
"34589",7849,"guard explained that he had to look into it himself, saluted, and","The Trial"
"34590",7849,"hurried on, walking with very short steps, probably because of gout.</p>","The Trial"
"34591",7849,"","The Trial"
"34592",7849,"<p>K. didn't concern himself long with the guard or these people,","The Trial"
"34593",7849,"especially as he saw a turning off the corridor, about half way along","The Trial"
"34594",7849,"it on the right hand side, where there was no door to stop him going","The Trial"
"34595",7849,"that way. He asked the usher whether that was the right way to go, the","The Trial"
"34596",7849,"usher nodded, and that is the way that K. went. The usher remained","The Trial"
"34597",7849,"always one or two steps behind K., which he found irritating as in a","The Trial"
"34598",7849,"place like this it could give the impression that he was being driven","The Trial"
"34599",7849,"along by someone who had arrested him, so he frequently waited for the","The Trial"
"34600",7849,"usher to catch up, but the usher always remained behind him. In order to","The Trial"
"34601",7849,"put an end to his discomfort, K. finally said, ""Now that I've seen what","The Trial"
"34602",7849,"it looks like here, I'd like to go."" ""You haven't seen everything yet,""","The Trial"
"34603",7849,"said the usher ingenuously. ""I don't want to see everything,"" said K.,","The Trial"
"34604",7849,"who was also feeling very tired, ""I want to go, what is the way to the","The Trial"
"34605",7849,"exit?"" ""You haven't got lost, have you?"" asked the usher in amazement,","The Trial"
"34606",7849,"""you go down this way to the corner, then right down the corridor","The Trial"
"34607",7849,"straight ahead as far as the door."" ""Come with me,"" said K., ""show me","The Trial"
"34608",7849,"the way, I'll miss it, there are so many different ways here."" ""It's the","The Trial"
"34609",7849,"only way there is,"" said the usher, who had now started to sound quite","The Trial"
"34610",7849,"reproachful, ""I can't go back with you again, I've got to hand in my","The Trial"
"34611",7849,"report, and I've already lost a lot of time because of you as it is.""","The Trial"
"34612",7849,"""Come with me!"" K. repeated, now somewhat sharper as if he had finally","The Trial"
"34613",7849,"caught the usher out in a lie. ""Don't shout like that,"" whispered the","The Trial"
"34614",7849,"usher, ""there's offices all round us here. If you don't want to go back","The Trial"
"34615",7849,"by yourself come on a bit further with me or else wait here till I've","The Trial"
"34616",7849,"sorted out my report, then I'll be glad to go back with you again."" ""No,","The Trial"
"34617",7849,"no,"" said K., ""I will not wait and you must come with me now."" K. had","The Trial"
"34618",7849,"still not looked round at anything at all in the room where he found","The Trial"
"34619",7849,"himself, and it was only when one of the many wooden doors all around","The Trial"
"34620",7849,"him opened that he noticed it. A young woman, probably summoned by the","The Trial"
"34621",7849,"loudness of K.'s voice, entered and asked, ""What is it the gentleman","The Trial"
"34622",7849,"wants?"" In the darkness behind her there was also a man approaching. K.","The Trial"
"34623",7849,"looked at the usher. He had, after all, said that no-one would take any","The Trial"
"34624",7849,"notice of K., and now there were two people coming, it only needed a few","The Trial"
"34625",7849,"and everyone in the office would become aware of him and asking for","The Trial"
"34626",7849,"explanations as to why he was there. The only understandable and","The Trial"
"34627",7849,"acceptable thing to say was that he was accused of something and wanted","The Trial"
"34628",7849,"to know the date of his next hearing, but this was an explanation he did","The Trial"
"34629",7849,"not want to give, especially as it was not true&mdash;he had only come out of","The Trial"
"34630",7849,"curiosity. Or else, an explanation even less usable, he could say that","The Trial"
"34631",7849,"he wanted to ascertain that the court was as revolting on the inside as","The Trial"
"34632",7849,"it was on the outside. And it did seem that he had been quite right in","The Trial"
"34633",7849,"this supposition, he had no wish to intrude any deeper, he was disturbed","The Trial"
"34634",7849,"enough by what he had seen already, he was not in the right frame of","The Trial"
"34635",7849,"mind just then to face a high official such as might appear from behind","The Trial"
"34636",7849,"any door, and he wanted to go, either with the usher of the court or, if","The Trial"
"34637",7849,"needs be, alone.</p>","The Trial"
"34638",7849,"","The Trial"
"34639",7849,"<p>But he must have seemed very odd standing there in silence, and the","The Trial"
"34640",7849,"young woman and the usher were indeed looking at him as if they thought","The Trial"
"34641",7849,"he would go through some major metamorphosis any second which they","The Trial"
"34642",7849,"didn't want to miss seeing. And in the doorway stood the man whom K. had","The Trial"
"34643",7849,"noticed in the background earlier, he held firmly on to the beam above","The Trial"
"34644",7849,"the low door swinging a little on the tips of his feet as if becoming","The Trial"
"34645",7849,"impatient as he watched. But the young woman was the first to recognise","The Trial"
"34646",7849,"that K.'s behaviour was caused by his feeling slightly unwell, she","The Trial"
"34647",7849,"brought a chair and asked, ""Would you not like to sit down?"" K. sat down","The Trial"
"34648",7849,"immediately and, in order to keep his place better, put his elbows on","The Trial"
"34649",7849,"the armrests. ""You're a little bit dizzy, aren't you?"" she asked him.","The Trial"
"34650",7849,"Her face was now close in front of him, it bore the severe expression","The Trial"
"34651",7849,"that many young women have just when they're in the bloom of their","The Trial"
"34652",7849,"youth. ""It's nothing for you to worry about,"" she said, ""that's nothing","The Trial"
"34653",7849,"unusual here, almost everyone gets an attack like that the first time","The Trial"
"34654",7849,"they come here. This is your first time is it. Yes, it's nothing unusual","The Trial"
"34655",7849,"then. The sun burns down on the roof and the hot wood makes the air so","The Trial"
"34656",7849,"thick and heavy. It makes this place rather unsuitable for offices,","The Trial"
"34657",7849,"whatever other advantages it might offer. But the air is almost","The Trial"
"34658",7849,"impossible to breathe on days when there's a lot of business, and that's","The Trial"
"34659",7849,"almost every day. And when you think that there's a lot of washing put","The Trial"
"34660",7849,"out to dry here as well&mdash;and we can't stop the tenants doing that&mdash;it's","The Trial"
"34661",7849,"not surprising you started to feel unwell. But you get used to the air","The Trial"
"34662",7849,"alright in the end. When you're here for the second or third time you'll","The Trial"
"34663",7849,"hardly notice how oppressive the air is. Are you feeling any better","The Trial"
"34664",7849,"now?"" K. made no answer, he felt too embarrassed at being put at the","The Trial"
"34665",7849,"mercy of these people by his sudden weakness, and learning the reason","The Trial"
"34666",7849,"for feeling ill made him feel not better but a little worse. The girl","The Trial"
"34667",7849,"noticed it straight away, and to make the air fresher for K., she took a","The Trial"
"34668",7849,"window pole that was leaning against the wall and pushed open a small","The Trial"
"34669",7849,"hatch directly above K.'s head that led to the outside. But so much soot","The Trial"
"34670",7849,"fell in that the girl had to immediately close the hatch again and clean","The Trial"
"34671",7849,"the soot off K.'s hands with her handkerchief, as K. was too tired to do","The Trial"
"34672",7849,"that for himself. He would have liked just to sit quietly where he was","The Trial"
"34673",7849,"until he had enough strength to leave, and the less fuss people made","The Trial"
"34674",7849,"about him the sooner that would be. But then the girl said, ""You can't","The Trial"
"34675",7849,"stay here, we're in people's way here...."" K. looked at her as if to ask","The Trial"
"34676",7849,"whose way they were impeding. ""If you like, I can take you to the sick","The Trial"
"34677",7849,"room,"" and turning to the man in the doorway said, ""please help me."" The","The Trial"
"34678",7849,"man immediately came over to them, but K. did not want to go to the sick","The Trial"
"34679",7849,"room, that was just what he wanted to avoid, being led further from","The Trial"
"34680",7849,"place to place, the further he went the more difficult it must become.","The Trial"
"34681",7849,"So he said, ""I am able to walk now,"" and stood up, shaking after","The Trial"
"34682",7849,"becoming used to sitting so comfortably. But then he was unable to stay","The Trial"
"34683",7849,"upright. ""I can't manage it,"" he said shaking his head, and sat down","The Trial"
"34684",7849,"again with a sigh. He remembered the usher who, despite everything,","The Trial"
"34685",7849,"would have been able to lead him out of there but who seemed to have","The Trial"
"34686",7849,"gone long before. K. looked out between the man and the young woman who","The Trial"
"34687",7849,"were standing in front of him but was unable to find the usher. ""I","The Trial"
"34688",7849,"think,"" said the man, who was elegantly dressed and whose appearance was","The Trial"
"34689",7849,"made especially impressive with a grey waistcoat that had two long,","The Trial"
"34690",7849,"sharply tailored points, ""the gentleman is feeling unwell because of the","The Trial"
"34691",7849,"atmosphere here, so the best thing, and what he would most prefer, would","The Trial"
"34692",7849,"be not to take him to the sick room but get him out of the offices","The Trial"
"34693",7849,"altogether."" ""That's right,"" exclaimed K., with such joy that he nearly","The Trial"
"34694",7849,"interrupted what the man was saying, ""I'm sure that'll make me feel","The Trial"
"34695",7849,"better straight away, I'm really not that weak, all I need is a little","The Trial"
"34696",7849,"support under my arms, I won't cause you much trouble, it's not such a","The Trial"
"34697",7849,"long way anyway, lead me to the door and then I'll sit on the stairs for","The Trial"
"34698",7849,"a while and soon recover, as I don't suffer from attacks like this at","The Trial"
"34699",7849,"all, I'm surprised at it myself. I also work in an office and I'm quite","The Trial"
"34700",7849,"used to office air, but here it seems to be too strong, you've said so","The Trial"
"34701",7849,"yourselves. So please, be so kind as to help me on my way a little, I'm","The Trial"
"34702",7849,"feeling dizzy, you see, and it'll make me ill if I stand up by myself.""","The Trial"
"34703",7849,"And with that he raised his shoulders to make it easier for the two of","The Trial"
"34704",7849,"them to take him by the arms.</p>","The Trial"
"34705",7849,"","The Trial"
"34706",7849,"<p>The man, however, didn't follow this suggestion but just stood there","The Trial"
"34707",7849,"with his hands in his trouser pockets and laughed out loud. ""There, you","The Trial"
"34708",7849,"see,"" he said to the girl, ""I was quite right. The gentleman is only","The Trial"
"34709",7849,"unwell here, and not in general."" The young woman smiled too, but","The Trial"
"34710",7849,"lightly tapped the man's arm with the tips of her fingers as if he had","The Trial"
"34711",7849,"allowed himself too much fun with K. ""So what do you think, then?"" said","The Trial"
"34712",7849,"the man, still laughing, ""I really do want to lead the gentleman out of","The Trial"
"34713",7849,"here."" ""That's alright, then,"" said the girl, briefly inclining her","The Trial"
"34714",7849,"charming head. ""Don't worry too much about him laughing,"" said the girl","The Trial"
"34715",7849,"to K., who had become unhappy once more and stared quietly in front of","The Trial"
"34716",7849,"himself as if needing no further explanation. ""This gentleman&mdash;may I","The Trial"
"34717",7849,"introduce you?""&mdash;(the man gave his permission with a wave of the","The Trial"
"34718",7849,"hand)&mdash;""so, this gentleman's job is to give out information. He gives","The Trial"
"34719",7849,"all the information they need to people who are waiting, as our court","The Trial"
"34720",7849,"and its offices are not very well known among the public he gets asked","The Trial"
"34721",7849,"for quite a lot. He has an answer for every question, you can try him","The Trial"
"34722",7849,"out if you feel like it. But that's not his only distinction, his other","The Trial"
"34723",7849,"distinction is his elegance of dress. We, that's to say all of us who","The Trial"
"34724",7849,"work in the offices here, we decided that the information-giver would","The Trial"
"34725",7849,"have to be elegantly dressed as he continually has to deal with the","The Trial"
"34726",7849,"litigants and he's the first one they meet, so he needs to give a","The Trial"
"34727",7849,"dignified first impression. The rest of us I'm afraid, as you can see","The Trial"
"34728",7849,"just by looking at me, dress very badly and old-fashioned; and there's","The Trial"
"34729",7849,"not much point in spending much on clothes anyway, as we hardly ever","The Trial"
"34730",7849,"leave the offices, we even sleep here. But, as I said, we decided that","The Trial"
"34731",7849,"the information-giver would have to have nice clothes. As the management","The Trial"
"34732",7849,"here is rather peculiar in this respect, and they would get them for us,","The Trial"
"34733",7849,"we had a collection&mdash;some of the litigants contributed too&mdash;and bought","The Trial"
"34734",7849,"him these lovely clothes and some others besides. So everything would be","The Trial"
"34735",7849,"ready for him to give a good impression, except that he spoils it again","The Trial"
"34736",7849,"by laughing and frightening people."" ""That's how it is,"" said the man,","The Trial"
"34737",7849,"mocking her, ""but I don't understand why it is that you're explaining","The Trial"
"34738",7849,"all our intimate facts to the gentleman, or rather why it is that you're","The Trial"
"34739",7849,"pressing them on him, as I'm sure he's not all interested. Just look at","The Trial"
"34740",7849,"him sitting there, it's clear he's occupied with his own affairs."" K.","The Trial"
"34741",7849,"just did not feel like contradicting him. The girl's intention may have","The Trial"
"34742",7849,"been good, perhaps she was under instructions to distract him or to give","The Trial"
"34743",7849,"him the chance to collect himself, but the attempt had not worked. ""I","The Trial"
"34744",7849,"had to explain to him why you were laughing,"" said the girl. ""I suppose","The Trial"
"34745",7849,"it was insulting."" ""I think he would forgive even worse insults if I","The Trial"
"34746",7849,"finally took him outside."" K. said nothing, did not even look up, he","The Trial"
"34747",7849,"tolerated the two of them negotiating over him like an object, that was","The Trial"
"34748",7849,"even what suited him best. But suddenly he felt the information-giver's","The Trial"
"34749",7849,"hand on one arm and the young woman's hand on the other. ""Up you get","The Trial"
"34750",7849,"then, weakling,"" said the information-giver. ""Thank you both very much,""","The Trial"
"34751",7849,"said K., pleasantly surprised, as he slowly rose and personally guided","The Trial"
"34752",7849,"these unfamiliar hands to the places where he most needed support. As","The Trial"
"34753",7849,"they approached the corridor, the girl said quietly into K.'s ear, ""I","The Trial"
"34754",7849,"must seem to think it's very important to show the information-giver in","The Trial"
"34755",7849,"a good light, but you shouldn't doubt what I say, I just want to say the","The Trial"
"34756",7849,"truth. He isn't hard-hearted. It's not really his job to help litigants","The Trial"
"34757",7849,"outside if they're unwell but he's doing it anyway, as you can see. I","The Trial"
"34758",7849,"don't suppose any of us is hard-hearted, perhaps we'd all like to be","The Trial"
"34759",7849,"helpful, but working for the court offices it's easy for us to give the","The Trial"
"34760",7849,"impression we are hard-hearted and don't want to help anyone. It makes","The Trial"
"34761",7849,"me quite sad."" ""Would you not like to sit down here a while?"" asked the","The Trial"
"34762",7849,"information-giver, there were already in the corridor and just in front","The Trial"
"34763",7849,"of the defendant whom K. had spoken to earlier. K. felt almost ashamed","The Trial"
"34764",7849,"to be seen by him, earlier he had stood so upright in front of him and","The Trial"
"34765",7849,"now he had to be supported by two others, his hat was held up by the","The Trial"
"34766",7849,"information-giver balanced on outstretched fingers, his hair was","The Trial"
"34767",7849,"dishevelled and hung down onto the sweat on his forehead. But the","The Trial"
"34768",7849,"defendant seemed to notice nothing of what was going on and just stood","The Trial"
"34769",7849,"there humbly, as if wanting to apologise to the information-giver for","The Trial"
"34770",7849,"being there. The information-giver looked past him. ""I know,"" he said,","The Trial"
"34771",7849,"""that my case can't be settled today, not yet, but I've come in anyway,","The Trial"
"34772",7849,"I thought, I thought I could wait here anyway, it's Sunday today, I've","The Trial"
"34773",7849,"got plenty of time, and I'm not disturbing anyone here."" ""There's no","The Trial"
"34774",7849,"need to be so apologetic,"" said the information-giver, ""it's very","The Trial"
"34775",7849,"commendable for you to be so attentive. You are taking up space here","The Trial"
"34776",7849,"when you don't need to but as long as you don't get in my way I will do","The Trial"
"34777",7849,"nothing to stop you following the progress of your case as closely as","The Trial"
"34778",7849,"you like. When one has seen so many people who shamefully neglect their","The Trial"
"34779",7849,"cases one learns to show patience with people like you. Do sit down.""","The Trial"
"34780",7849,"""He's very good with the litigants,"" whispered the girl. K. nodded, but","The Trial"
"34781",7849,"started to move off again when the information-giver repeated, ""Would","The Trial"
"34782",7849,"you not like to sit down here a while?"" ""No,"" said K., ""I don't want to","The Trial"
"34783",7849,"rest."" He had said that as decisively as he could, but in fact it would","The Trial"
"34784",7849,"have done him a lot of good to sit down. It was as if he were suffering","The Trial"
"34785",7849,"sea-sickness. He felt as if he were on a ship in a rough sea, as if the","The Trial"
"34786",7849,"water were hitting against the wooden walls, a thundering from the","The Trial"
"34787",7849,"depths of the corridor as if the torrent were crashing over it, as if","The Trial"
"34788",7849,"the corridor were swaying and the waiting litigants on each side of it","The Trial"
"34789",7849,"rising and sinking. It made the calmness of the girl and the man leading","The Trial"
"34790",7849,"him all the more incomprehensible. He was at their mercy, if they let go","The Trial"
"34791",7849,"of him he would fall like a board. Their little eyes glanced here and","The Trial"
"34792",7849,"there, K. could feel the evenness of their steps but could not do the","The Trial"
"34793",7849,"same, as from step to step he was virtually being carried. He finally","The Trial"
"34794",7849,"noticed they were speaking to him but he did not understand them, all he","The Trial"

"34798",7849,"speak louder when he knew they had spoken loudly enough, even if it had","The Trial"

"34806",7849,"freedom he stepped straight on to one of the stairs and took his leave","The Trial"
"34807",7849,"there of his companions, who bowed to him. ""Thank you very much,"" he","The Trial"

"34810",7849,"air from the stairway after being so long used to the air in the","The Trial"
"34811",7849,"offices. They were hardly able to reply, and the young woman might even","The Trial"
"34812",7849,"have fallen over if K. had not shut the door extremely fast. K. then","The Trial"

"34816",7849,"and in such long leaps that the contrast with his previous state nearly","The Trial"
"34817",7849,"frightened him. His normally sturdy state of health had never prepared","The Trial"

"34873",7849,"perceived as forgiveness, or as the beginning of forgiveness. ""We're not","The Trial"

"34878",7849,"took the spoon and pensively stirred his coffee while he remained","The Trial"
"34879",7849,"silent. Then he looked up at her and said, ""What about the suspicions","The Trial"

"34881",7849,"called Mrs. Grubach, who had been waiting for this very question, as she","The Trial"

"34894",7849,"into her room. ""Now don't cry,"" he said again as he turned his look back","The Trial"
"34895",7849,"into the room where Mrs. Grubach was still crying. ""I meant no harm","The Trial"
"34896",7849,"either when I said that. It was simply a misunderstanding between us.","The Trial"
"34897",7849,"That can happen even between old friends sometimes."" Mrs. Grubach pulled","The Trial"
"34898",7849,"her apron down to below her eyes to see whether K. really was attempting","The Trial"
"34899",7849,"a reconciliation. ""Well, yes, that's how it is,"" said K., and as Mrs.","The Trial"
"34900",7849,"Grubach's behaviour indicated that the captain had said nothing he dared","The Trial"

"34904",7849,"felt just a little freer to speak, she added something rather inept. ""I","The Trial"
"34905",7849,"kept asking myself why it was that Mr. K. took such an interest in Miss","The Trial"
"34906",7849,"Bürstner. Why does he quarrel with me over her when he knows that any","The Trial"

"34908",7849,"anything about Miss Bürstner that I hadn't seen with my own eyes."" K.","The Trial"
"34909",7849,"said nothing in reply, he should have chased her from the room as soon","The Trial"
"34910",7849,"as she had opened her mouth, and he didn't want to do that. He contented","The Trial"
"34911",7849,"himself with merely drinking his coffee and letting Mrs. Grubach feel","The Trial"
"34912",7849,"that she was superfluous. Outside, the dragging steps of Miss Montag","The Trial"
"34913",7849,"could still be heard as she went from one side of the hallway to the","The Trial"

"34915",7849,"""Yes,"" said Mrs. Grubach with a sigh, ""I wanted to give her some help","The Trial"
"34916",7849,"and I wanted the maid to help her too but she's stubborn, she wants to","The Trial"
"34917",7849,"move everything in herself. I wonder at Miss Bürstner. I often feel it's","The Trial"
"34918",7849,"a burden for me to have Miss Montag as a tenant but Miss Bürstner","The Trial"

"34921",7849,"cup. ""Does she cause you any trouble?"" ""No,"" said Mrs. Grubach, ""in","The Trial"
"34922",7849,"itself it's very good to have her there, it makes another room free for","The Trial"
"34923",7849,"me and I can let my nephew, the captain, occupy it. I began to worry he","The Trial"

"34926",7849,"idea!"" said K. standing up, ""there's no question of that. You seem to","The Trial"
"34927",7849,"think that because I can't stand this to-ing and fro-ing of Miss Montag","The Trial"
"34928",7849,"that I'm over-sensitive&mdash;and there she goes back again."" Mrs. Grubach","The Trial"
"34929",7849,"appeared quite powerless. ""Should I tell her to leave moving the rest of","The Trial"
"34930",7849,"her things over till later, then, Mr. K.? If that's what you want I'll","The Trial"
"34931",7849,"do it immediately."" ""But she has to move in with Miss Bürstner!"" said K.","The Trial"
"34932",7849,"""Yes,"" said Mrs. Grubach, without quite understanding what K. meant. ""So","The Trial"
"34933",7849,"she has to take her things over there."" Mrs. Grubach just nodded. K. was","The Trial"
"34934",7849,"irritated all the more by this dumb helplessness which, seen from the","The Trial"
"34935",7849,"outside, could have seemed like a kind of defiance on her part. He began","The Trial"
"34936",7849,"to walk up and down the room between the window and the door, thus","The Trial"
"34937",7849,"depriving Mrs. Grubach of the chance to leave, which she otherwise","The Trial"
"34938",7849,"probably would have done.</p>","The Trial"
"34939",7849,"","The Trial"
"34940",7849,"<p>Just as K. once more reached the door, someone knocked at it. It was the","The Trial"

"34942",7849,"K., and therefore requested that he come to the dining room where she","The Trial"
"34943",7849,"was waiting for him. K. heard the maid out thoughtfully, and then looked","The Trial"
"34944",7849,"back at the shocked Mrs. Grubach in a way that was almost contemptuous.","The Trial"
"34945",7849,"His look seemed to be saying that K. had been expecting this invitation","The Trial"
"34946",7849,"for Miss Montag for a long time, and that it was confirmation of the","The Trial"
"34947",7849,"suffering he had been made to endure that Sunday morning from Mrs.","The Trial"
"34948",7849,"Grubach's tenants. He sent the maid back with the reply that he was on","The Trial"
"34949",7849,"his way, then he went to the wardrobe to change his coat, and in answer","The Trial"
"34950",7849,"to Mrs. Grubach's gentle whining about the nuisance Miss Montag was","The Trial"
"34951",7849,"causing merely asked her to clear away the breakfast things. ""But you've","The Trial"
"34952",7849,"hardly touched it,"" said Mrs. Grubach. ""Oh just take it away!"" shouted","The Trial"
"34953",7849,"K. It seemed to him that Miss Montag was mixed up in everything and made","The Trial"

"34956",7849,"<p>As he went through the hallway he looked at the closed door of Miss","The Trial"

"34959",7849,"","The Trial"

"34963",7849,"dining table which started by the door and reached all the way to the","The Trial"
"34964",7849,"great window, which was thus made almost inaccessible. The table was","The Trial"
"34965",7849,"already laid for a large number of people, as on Sundays almost all the","The Trial"

"34968",7849,"<p>When K. entered, Miss Montag came towards him from the window along one","The Trial"

"34970",7849,"her head unusually erect as always, said, ""I'm not sure whether you know","The Trial"
"34971",7849,"me."" K. looked at her with a frown. ""Of course I do,"" he said, ""you've","The Trial"
"34972",7849,"been living here with Mrs. Grubach for quite some time now."" ""But I get","The Trial"
"34973",7849,"the impression you don't pay much attention to what's going on in the","The Trial"
"34974",7849,"lodging house,"" said Miss Montag. ""No,"" said K. ""Would you not like to","The Trial"
"34975",7849,"sit down?"" said Miss Montag. In silence, the two of them drew chairs out","The Trial"
"34976",7849,"from the farthest end of the table and sat down facing each other. But","The Trial"
"34977",7849,"Miss Montag stood straight up again as she had left her handbag on the","The Trial"
"34978",7849,"window sill and went to fetch it; she shuffled down the whole length of","The Trial"
"34979",7849,"the room. When she came back, the handbag lightly swinging, she said,","The Trial"
"34980",7849,"""I'd like just to have a few words with you on behalf of my friend. She","The Trial"
"34981",7849,"would have come herself, but she's feeling a little unwell today.","The Trial"
"34982",7849,"Perhaps you'll be kind enough to forgive her and listen to me instead.","The Trial"
"34983",7849,"There's anyway nothing that she could have said that I won't. On the","The Trial"
"34984",7849,"contrary, in fact, I think I can say even more than her because I'm","The Trial"
"34985",7849,"relatively impartial. Would you not agree?"" ""What is there to say,","The Trial"
"34986",7849,"then?"" answered K., who was tired of Miss Montag continuously watching","The Trial"
"34987",7849,"his lips. In that way she took control of what he wanted to say before","The Trial"
"34988",7849,"he said it. ""Miss Bürstner clearly refuses to grant me the personal","The Trial"
"34989",7849,"meeting that I asked her for."" ""That's how it is,"" said Miss Montag, ""or","The Trial"
"34990",7849,"rather, that's not at all how it is, the way you put it is remarkably","The Trial"
"34991",7849,"severe. Generally speaking, meetings are neither granted nor the","The Trial"
"34992",7849,"opposite. But it can be that meetings are considered unnecessary, and","The Trial"
"34993",7849,"that's how it is here. Now, after your comment, I can speak openly. You","The Trial"
"34994",7849,"asked my friend, verbally or in writing, for the chance to speak with","The Trial"
"34995",7849,"her. Now my friend is aware of your reasons for asking for this","The Trial"
"34996",7849,"meeting&mdash;or at least I suppose she is&mdash;and so, for reasons I know","The Trial"
"34997",7849,"nothing about, she is quite sure that it would be of no benefit to","The Trial"
"34998",7849,"anyone if this meeting actually took place. Moreover, it was only","The Trial"
"34999",7849,"yesterday, and only very briefly, that she made it clear to me that such","The Trial"
"35000",7849,"a meeting could be of no benefit for yourself either, she feels that it","The Trial"
"35001",7849,"can only have been a matter of chance that such an idea came to you, and","The Trial"
"35002",7849,"that even without any explanations from her, you will very soon come to","The Trial"
"35003",7849,"realise yourself, if you have not done so already, the futility of your","The Trial"
"35004",7849,"idea. My answer to that is that although it may be quite right, I","The Trial"
"35005",7849,"consider it advantageous, if the matter is to be made perfectly clear,","The Trial"
"35006",7849,"to give you an explicit answer. I offered my services in taking on the","The Trial"
"35007",7849,"task, and after some hesitation my friend conceded. I hope, however,","The Trial"
"35008",7849,"also to have acted in your interests, as even the slightest uncertainty","The Trial"
"35009",7849,"in the least significant of matters will always remain a cause of","The Trial"
"35010",7849,"suffering and if, as in this case, it can be removed without substantial","The Trial"
"35011",7849,"effort, then it is better if that is done without delay."" ""I thank you,""","The Trial"
"35012",7849,"said K. as soon as Miss Montag had finished. He stood slowly up, looked","The Trial"
"35013",7849,"at her, then across the table, then out the window&mdash;the house opposite","The Trial"
"35014",7849,"stood there in the sun&mdash;and went to the door. Miss Montag followed him a","The Trial"
"35015",7849,"few paces, as if she did not quite trust him. At the door, however, both","The Trial"
"35016",7849,"of them had to step back as it opened and Captain Lanz entered. This was","The Trial"
"35017",7849,"the first time that K. had seen him close up. He was a large man of","The Trial"
"35018",7849,"about forty with a tanned, fleshy face. He bowed slightly, intending it","The Trial"
"35019",7849,"also for K., and then went over to Miss Montag and deferentially kissed","The Trial"
"35020",7849,"her hand. He was very elegant in the way he moved. The courtesy he","The Trial"
"35021",7849,"showed towards Miss Montag made a striking contrast with the way she had","The Trial"
"35022",7849,"been treated by K. Nonetheless, Miss Montag did not seem to be cross","The Trial"
"35023",7849,"with K. as it even seemed to him that she wanted to introduce the","The Trial"
"35024",7849,"captain. K. however, did not want to be introduced, he would not have","The Trial"
"35025",7849,"been able to show any sort of friendliness either to Miss Montag or to","The Trial"
"35026",7849,"the captain, the kiss on the hand had, for K., bound them into a group","The Trial"
"35027",7849,"which would keep him at a distance from Miss Bürstner whilst at the same","The Trial"
"35028",7849,"time seeming to be totally harmless and unselfish. K. thought, however,","The Trial"
"35029",7849,"that he saw more than that, he thought he also saw that Miss Montag had","The Trial"
"35030",7849,"chosen a means of doing it that was good, but two-edged. She exaggerated","The Trial"
"35031",7849,"the importance of the relationship between K. and Miss Bürstner, and","The Trial"
"35032",7849,"above all she exaggerated the importance of asking to speak with her and","The Trial"
"35033",7849,"she tried at the same time to make out that K. was exaggerating","The Trial"
"35034",7849,"everything. She would be disappointed, K. did not want to exaggerate","The Trial"
"35035",7849,"anything, he was aware that Miss Bürstner was a little typist who would","The Trial"
"35036",7849,"not offer him much resistance for long. In doing so he deliberately took","The Trial"

"35038",7849,"these things were going through his mind as he left the room with hardly","The Trial"
"35039",7849,"a polite word. He wanted to go straight to his room, but a little laugh","The Trial"
"35040",7849,"from Miss Montag that he heard from the dining room behind him brought","The Trial"
"35041",7849,"him to the idea that he might prepare a surprise for the two of them,","The Trial"
"35042",7849,"the captain and Miss Montag. He looked round and listened to find out if","The Trial"
"35043",7849,"there might be any disturbance from any of the surrounding rooms,","The Trial"
"35044",7849,"everywhere was quiet, the only thing to be heard was the conversation","The Trial"
"35045",7849,"from the dining room and Mrs. Grubach's voice from the passage leading","The Trial"
"35046",7849,"to the kitchen. This seemed an opportune time, K. went to Miss","The Trial"
"35047",7849,"Bürstner's room and knocked gently. There was no sound so he knocked","The Trial"
"35048",7849,"again but there was still no answer in reply. Was she asleep? Or was","The Trial"
"35049",7849,"she really unwell? Or was she just pretending as she realised it could","The Trial"
"35050",7849,"only be K. knocking so gently? K. assumed she was pretending and","The Trial"
"35051",7849,"knocked harder, eventually, when the knocking brought no result, he","The Trial"
"35052",7849,"carefully opened the door with the sense of doing something that was not","The Trial"
"35053",7849,"only improper but also pointless. In the room there was no-one. What's","The Trial"
"35054",7849,"more, it looked hardly at all like the room K. had known before. Against","The Trial"
"35055",7849,"the wall there were now two beds behind one another, there were clothes","The Trial"
"35056",7849,"piled up on three chairs near the door, a wardrobe stood open. Miss","The Trial"
"35057",7849,"Bürstner must have gone out while Miss Montag was speaking to him in the","The Trial"

"35059",7849,"to be able to find Miss Bürstner so easily and had made this attempt for","The Trial"
"35060",7849,"little more reason than to spite Miss Montag. But that made it all the","The Trial"

"35081",7849,"that separated his office from the main stairway&mdash;he was nearly the last","The Trial"
"35082",7849,"one to leave for home that evening, there remained only a couple of","The Trial"

"35084",7849,"he heard a sigh from behind a door which he had himself never opened but","The Trial"

"35086",7849,"amazement and listened again to establish whether he might not be","The Trial"

"35088",7849,"His first thought was to fetch one of the servitors, it might well have","The Trial"
"35089",7849,"been worth having a witness present, but then he was taken by an","The Trial"
"35090",7849,"uncontrollable curiosity that make him simply yank the door open. It","The Trial"
"35091",7849,"was, as he had thought, a junk room. Old, unusable forms, empty stone","The Trial"
"35092",7849,"ink-bottles lay scattered behind the entrance. But in the cupboard-like","The Trial"
"35093",7849,"room itself stood three men, crouching under the low ceiling. A candle","The Trial"
"35094",7849,"fixed on a shelf gave them light. ""What are you doing here?"" asked K.","The Trial"
"35095",7849,"quietly, but crossly and without thinking. One of the men was clearly in","The Trial"
"35096",7849,"charge, and attracted attention by being dressed in a kind of dark","The Trial"
"35097",7849,"leather costume which left his neck and chest and his arms exposed. He","The Trial"
"35098",7849,"did not answer. But the other two called out, ""Mr. K.! We're to be","The Trial"
"35099",7849,"beaten because you made a complaint about us to the examining judge.""","The Trial"
"35100",7849,"And now, K. finally realised that it was actually the two policemen,","The Trial"
"35101",7849,"Franz and Willem, and that the third man held a cane in his hand with","The Trial"
"35102",7849,"which to beat them. ""Well,"" said K., staring at them, ""I didn't make any","The Trial"
"35103",7849,"complaint, I only said what took place in my home. And your behaviour","The Trial"
"35104",7849,"was not entirely unobjectionable, after all."" ""Mr. K.,"" said Willem,","The Trial"
"35105",7849,"while Franz clearly tried to shelter behind him as protection from the","The Trial"
"35106",7849,"third man, ""if you knew how badly we get paid you wouldn't think so","The Trial"
"35107",7849,"badly of us. I've got a family to feed, and Franz here wanted to get","The Trial"
"35108",7849,"married, you just have to get more money where you can, you can't do it","The Trial"
"35109",7849,"just by working hard, not however hard you try. I was sorely tempted by","The Trial"
"35110",7849,"your fine clothes, policemen aren't allowed to do that sort of thing,","The Trial"
"35111",7849,"course they aren't, and it wasn't right of us, but it's tradition that","The Trial"
"35112",7849,"the clothes go to the officers, that's how it's always been, believe me;","The Trial"
"35113",7849,"and it's understandable too, isn't it, what can things like that mean","The Trial"
"35114",7849,"for anyone unlucky enough to be arrested. But if he starts talking about","The Trial"
"35115",7849,"it openly then the punishment has to follow."" ""I didn't know about any","The Trial"
"35116",7849,"of this that you've been telling me, and I made no sort of request that","The Trial"
"35117",7849,"you be punished, I was simply acting on principle."" ""Franz,"" said","The Trial"
"35118",7849,"Willem, turning to the other policeman, ""didn't I tell you that the","The Trial"
"35119",7849,"gentleman didn't say he wanted us to be punished. Now you can hear for","The Trial"
"35120",7849,"yourself, he didn't even know we'd have to be punished."" ""Don't you let","The Trial"
"35121",7849,"them persuade you, talking like that,"" said the third man to K., ""this","The Trial"
"35122",7849,"punishment is both just and unavoidable."" ""Don't listen to him,"" said","The Trial"
"35123",7849,"Willem, interrupting himself only to quickly bring his hand to his mouth","The Trial"
"35124",7849,"when it had received a stroke of the cane, ""we're only being punished","The Trial"
"35125",7849,"because you made a complaint against us. Nothing would have happened to","The Trial"
"35126",7849,"us otherwise, not even if they'd found out what we'd done. Can you call","The Trial"
"35127",7849,"that justice? Both of us, me especially, we'd proved our worth as good","The Trial"
"35128",7849,"police officers over a long period&mdash;you've got to admit yourself that as","The Trial"
"35129",7849,"far as official work was concerned we did the job well&mdash;things looked","The Trial"
"35130",7849,"good for us, we had prospects, it's quite certain that we would've been","The Trial"
"35131",7849,"made whip-men too, like this one, only he had the luck not to have","The Trial"
"35132",7849,"anyone make a complaint about him, as you really don't get many","The Trial"
"35133",7849,"complaints like that. Only that's all finished now, Mr. K., our careers","The Trial"
"35134",7849,"are at an end, we're going to have to do work now that's far inferior to","The Trial"
"35135",7849,"police work and besides all this we're going to get this terrible,","The Trial"
"35136",7849,"painful beating."" ""Can the cane really cause so much pain, then?"" asked","The Trial"
"35137",7849,"K., testing the cane that the whip-man swang in front of him. ""We're","The Trial"
"35138",7849,"going to have to strip off totally naked,"" said Willem. ""Oh, I see,""","The Trial"
"35139",7849,"said K., looking straight at the whip-man, his skin was burned brown","The Trial"
"35140",7849,"like a sailor's, and his face showed health and vigour. ""Is there then","The Trial"
"35141",7849,"no possibility of sparing these two their beating?"" he asked him. ""No,""","The Trial"
"35142",7849,"said the whip-man, shaking his head with a laugh. ""Get undressed!"" he","The Trial"
"35143",7849,"ordered the policemen. And to K. he said, ""You shouldn't believe","The Trial"
"35144",7849,"everything they tell you, it's the fear of being beaten, it's already","The Trial"
"35145",7849,"made them a bit weak in the head. This one here, for instance,"" he","The Trial"
"35146",7849,"pointed at Willem, ""all that he told you about his career prospects,","The Trial"
"35147",7849,"it's just ridiculous. Look at him, look how fat he is&mdash;the first strokes","The Trial"
"35148",7849,"of the cane will just get lost in all that fat. Do you know what it is","The Trial"
"35149",7849,"that's made him so fat. He's in the habit of, everyone that gets","The Trial"
"35150",7849,"arrested by him, he eats their breakfast. Didn't he eat up your","The Trial"
"35151",7849,"breakfast? Yeah, I thought as much. But a man with a belly like that","The Trial"
"35152",7849,"can't be made into a whip-man and never will be, that is quite out of","The Trial"
"35153",7849,"the question."" ""There are whip-men like that,"" Willem insisted, who had","The Trial"
"35154",7849,"just released the belt of this trousers. ""No,"" said the whip-man,","The Trial"
"35155",7849,"striking him such a blow with the cane on his neck that it made him","The Trial"
"35156",7849,"wince, ""you shouldn't be listening to this, just get undressed."" ""I","The Trial"
"35157",7849,"would make it well worth your while if you would let them go,"" said K.,","The Trial"
"35158",7849,"and without looking at the whip-man again&mdash;as such matters are best","The Trial"
"35159",7849,"carried on with both pairs of eyes turned down&mdash;he pulled out his","The Trial"
"35160",7849,"wallet. ""And then you'd try and put in a complaint against me, too,""","The Trial"
"35161",7849,"said the whip-man, ""and get me flogged. No, no!"" ""Now, do be","The Trial"
"35162",7849,"reasonable,"" said K., ""if I had wanted to get these two punished I would","The Trial"
"35163",7849,"not now be trying to buy their freedom, would I? I could simply close","The Trial"
"35164",7849,"the door here behind me, go home and see or hear nothing more of it. But","The Trial"
"35165",7849,"that's not what I'm doing, it really is of much more importance to me to","The Trial"
"35166",7849,"let them go free; if I had realised they would be punished, or even that","The Trial"
"35167",7849,"they might be punished, I would never have named them in the first place","The Trial"
"35168",7849,"as they are not the ones I hold responsible. It's the organisation","The Trial"
"35169",7849,"that's to blame, the high officials are the ones to blame."" ""That's how","The Trial"
"35170",7849,"it is!"" shouted the policemen, who then immediately received another","The Trial"
"35171",7849,"blow on their backs, which were by now exposed. ""If you had a senior","The Trial"
"35172",7849,"judge here beneath your stick,"" said K., pressing down the cane as he","The Trial"
"35173",7849,"spoke to stop it being raised once more, ""I really would do nothing to","The Trial"
"35174",7849,"stop you, on the contrary, I would even pay you money to give you all","The Trial"
"35175",7849,"the more strength."" ""Yeah, that's all very plausible, what you're saying","The Trial"
"35176",7849,"there,"" said the whip-man, ""only I'm not the sort of person you can","The Trial"
"35177",7849,"bribe. It's my job to flog people, so I flog them."" Franz, the","The Trial"
"35178",7849,"policeman, had been fairly quiet so far, probably in expectation of a","The Trial"
"35179",7849,"good result from K.'s intervention, but now he stepped forward to the","The Trial"
"35180",7849,"door wearing just his trousers, knelt down hanging on to K.'s arm and","The Trial"
"35181",7849,"whispered, ""Even if you can't get mercy shown for both of us, at least","The Trial"
"35182",7849,"try and get me set free. Willem is older than me, he's less sensitive","The Trial"
"35183",7849,"than me in every way, he even got a light beating a couple of years","The Trial"
"35184",7849,"ago, but my record's still clean, I only did things the way I did","The Trial"
"35185",7849,"because Willem led me on to it, he's been my teacher both for good and","The Trial"
"35186",7849,"bad. Down in front of the bank my poor bride is waiting for me at the","The Trial"
"35187",7849,"entrance, I'm so ashamed of myself, it's pitiful."" His face was flowing","The Trial"
"35188",7849,"over with tears, and he wiped it dry on K.'s coat. ""I'm not going to","The Trial"
"35189",7849,"wait any longer,"" said the whip-man, taking hold of the cane in both","The Trial"
"35190",7849,"hands and laying in to Franz while Willem cowered back in a corner and","The Trial"
"35191",7849,"looked on secretly, not even daring to turn his head. Then, the sudden","The Trial"
"35192",7849,"scream that shot out from Franz was long and irrevocable, it seemed to","The Trial"
"35193",7849,"come not from a human being but from an instrument that was being","The Trial"
"35194",7849,"tortured, the whole corridor rang with it, it must have been heard by","The Trial"
"35195",7849,"everyone in the building. ""Don't shout like that!"", called out K.,","The Trial"
"35196",7849,"unable to prevent himself, and, as he looked anxiously in the direction","The Trial"
"35197",7849,"from which the servitor would come, he gave Franz a shove, not hard, but","The Trial"
"35198",7849,"hard enough for him to fall down unconscious, clawing at the ground with","The Trial"
"35199",7849,"his hands by reflex; he still did not avoid being hit; the rod still","The Trial"
"35200",7849,"found him on the floor; the tip of the rod swang regularly up and down","The Trial"
"35201",7849,"while he rolled to and fro under its blows. And now one of the servitors","The Trial"
"35202",7849,"appeared in the distance, with another a few steps behind him. K. had","The Trial"
"35203",7849,"quickly thrown the door shut, gone over to one of the windows","The Trial"
"35204",7849,"overlooking the yard and opened it. The screams had completely stopped.","The Trial"
"35205",7849,"So that the servitor wouldn't come in, he called out, ""It's only me!""","The Trial"
"35206",7849,"""Good evening, chief clerk,"" somebody called back. ""Is there anything","The Trial"
"35207",7849,"wrong?"" ""No, no,"" answered K., ""it's only a dog yelping in the yard.""","The Trial"
"35208",7849,"There was no sound from the servitors so he added, ""You can go back to","The Trial"
"35209",7849,"what you were doing."" He did not want to become involved with a","The Trial"
"35210",7849,"conversation with them, and so he leant out of the window. A little","The Trial"
"35211",7849,"while later, when he looked out in the corridor, they had already gone.","The Trial"
"35212",7849,"Now, K. remained at the window, he did not dare go back into the junk","The Trial"
"35213",7849,"room, and he did not want to go home either. The yard he looked down","The Trial"
"35214",7849,"into was small and rectangular, all around it were offices, all the","The Trial"
"35215",7849,"windows were now dark and only those at the very top caught a reflection","The Trial"
"35216",7849,"of the moon. K. tried hard to see into the darkness of one corner of the","The Trial"
"35217",7849,"yard, where a few handcarts had been left behind one another. He felt","The Trial"
"35218",7849,"anguish at not having been able to prevent the flogging, but that was","The Trial"
"35219",7849,"not his fault, if Franz had not screamed like that&mdash;clearly it must have","The Trial"
"35220",7849,"caused a great deal of pain but it's important to maintain control of","The Trial"
"35221",7849,"oneself at important moments&mdash;if Franz had not screamed then it was at","The Trial"
"35222",7849,"least highly probable that K. would have been able to dissuade the","The Trial"
"35223",7849,"whip-man. If all the junior officers were contemptible why would the","The Trial"
"35224",7849,"whip-man, whose position was the most inhumane of all, be any exception,","The Trial"
"35225",7849,"and K. had noticed very clearly how his eyes had lit up when he saw the","The Trial"
"35226",7849,"banknotes, he had obviously only seemed serious about the flogging to","The Trial"
"35227",7849,"raise the level of the bribe a little. And K. had not been ungenerous,","The Trial"
"35228",7849,"he really had wanted to get the policemen freed; if he really had now","The Trial"
"35229",7849,"begun to do something against the degeneracy of the court then it was a","The Trial"
"35230",7849,"matter of course that he would have to do something here as well. But of","The Trial"
"35231",7849,"course, it became impossible for him to do anything as soon as Franz","The Trial"
"35232",7849,"started screaming. K. could not possibly have let the junior bank staff,","The Trial"
"35233",7849,"and perhaps even all sorts of other people, come along and catch him by","The Trial"
"35234",7849,"surprise as he haggled with those people in the junk room. Nobody could","The Trial"
"35235",7849,"really expect that sort of sacrifice of him. If that had been his","The Trial"
"35236",7849,"intention then it would almost have been easier, K. would have taken","The Trial"
"35237",7849,"his own clothes off and offered himself to the whip-man in the","The Trial"
"35238",7849,"policemen's place. The whip-man would certainly not have accepted this","The Trial"
"35239",7849,"substitution anyway, as in that way he would have seriously violated his","The Trial"
"35240",7849,"duty without gaining any benefit. He would most likely have violated his","The Trial"
"35241",7849,"duty twice over, as court employees were probably under orders not to","The Trial"
"35242",7849,"cause any harm to K. while he was facing charges, although there may","The Trial"
"35243",7849,"have been special conditions in force here. However things stood, K. was","The Trial"
"35244",7849,"able to do no more than throw the door shut, even though that would","The Trial"
"35245",7849,"still do nothing to remove all the dangers he faced. It was regrettable","The Trial"
"35246",7849,"that he had given Franz a shove, and it could only be excused by the","The Trial"
"35247",7849,"heat of the moment.</p>","The Trial"
"35248",7849,"","The Trial"
"35249",7849,"<p>In the distance, he heard the steps of the servitors; he did not want","The Trial"
"35250",7849,"them to be too aware of his presence, so he closed the window and","The Trial"
"35251",7849,"walked towards the main staircase. At the door of the junk room he","The Trial"
"35252",7849,"stopped and listened for a little while. All was silent. The two","The Trial"
"35253",7849,"policemen were entirely at the whip-man's mercy; he could have beaten","The Trial"
"35254",7849,"them to death. K. reached his hand out for the door handle but drew it","The Trial"
"35255",7849,"suddenly back. He was no longer in any position to help anyone, and the","The Trial"
"35256",7849,"servitors would soon be back; he did, though, promise himself that he","The Trial"
"35257",7849,"would raise the matter again with somebody and see that, as far as it","The Trial"
"35258",7849,"was in his power, those who really were guilty, the high officials whom","The Trial"
"35259",7849,"nobody had so far dared point out to him, received their due punishment.","The Trial"
"35260",7849,"As he went down the main stairway at the front of the bank, he looked","The Trial"
"35261",7849,"carefully round at everyone who was passing, but there was no girl to be","The Trial"
"35262",7849,"seen who might have been waiting for somebody, not even within some","The Trial"
"35263",7849,"distance from the bank. Franz's claim that his bride was waiting for him","The Trial"
"35264",7849,"was thus shown to be a lie, albeit one that was forgivable and intended","The Trial"
"35265",7849,"only to elicit more sympathy.</p>","The Trial"
"35266",7849,"","The Trial"
"35267",7849,"<p>The policemen were still on K.'s mind all through the following day; he","The Trial"
"35268",7849,"was unable to concentrate on his work and had to stay in his office a","The Trial"
"35269",7849,"little longer than the previous day so that he could finish it. On the","The Trial"
"35270",7849,"way home, as he passed by the junk room again, he opened its door as if","The Trial"
"35271",7849,"that had been his habit. Instead of the darkness he expected, he saw","The Trial"
"35272",7849,"everything unchanged from the previous evening, and did not know how he","The Trial"
"35273",7849,"should respond. Everything was exactly the same as he had seen it when","The Trial"
"35274",7849,"he had opened the door the previous evening. The forms and bottles of","The Trial"
"35275",7849,"ink just inside the doorway, the whip-man with his cane, the two","The Trial"
"35276",7849,"policemen, still undressed, the candle on the shelf, and the two","The Trial"
"35277",7849,"policemen began to wail and call out ""Mr. K.!"" K. slammed the door","The Trial"

"35333",7849,"From where he sat, he could see just a small, triangular section of it,","The Trial"

"35338",7849,"daydreaming, ""I really don't know what it is you want of me."" ""Josef,""","The Trial"
"35339",7849,"said his uncle in a warning tone, ""as far as I know, you've always told","The Trial"

"35345",7849,"with you, it's true, you don't pay very much attention to her, I'm","The Trial"
"35346",7849,"afraid to say, but she learned about it nonetheless. I got her letter","The Trial"
"35347",7849,"today and, of course, I came straight here. And for no other reason, but","The Trial"
"35348",7849,"it seems to me that this is reason enough. I can read you out the part","The Trial"

"35351",7849,"I was in the bank last week but Josef was so busy that they would not","The Trial"
"35352",7849,"let me through; I waited there for nearly an hour but then I had to go","The Trial"
"35353",7849,"home as I had my piano lesson. I would have liked to have spoken to him,","The Trial"
"35354",7849,"maybe there will be a chance another time. He sent me a big box of","The Trial"
"35355",7849,"chocolates for my name-day, that was very nice and attentive of him. I","The Trial"
"35356",7849,"forgot to tell you about it when I wrote, and I only remember now that","The Trial"
"35357",7849,"you ask me about it. Chocolate, as I am sure you are aware, disappears","The Trial"
"35358",7849,"straight away in this lodging house, almost as soon as you know somebody","The Trial"
"35359",7849,"has given you chocolate it is gone. But there is something else I wanted","The Trial"
"35360",7849,"to tell you about Josef. Like I said, they would not let me through to","The Trial"
"35361",7849,"see him at the bank because he was negotiating with some gentleman just","The Trial"
"35362",7849,"then. After I had been waiting quietly for quite a long time I asked one","The Trial"
"35363",7849,"of the staff whether his meeting would last much longer. He said it","The Trial"
"35364",7849,"might well do, as it was probably about the legal proceedings, he said,","The Trial"
"35365",7849,"that were being conducted against him. I asked what sort of legal","The Trial"
"35366",7849,"proceedings it was that were being conducted against the chief clerk,","The Trial"
"35367",7849,"and whether he was not making some mistake, but he said he was not","The Trial"
"35368",7849,"making any mistake, there were legal proceedings underway and even that","The Trial"
"35369",7849,"they were about something quite serious, but he did not know any more","The Trial"
"35370",7849,"about it. He would have liked to have been of some help to the chief","The Trial"
"35371",7849,"clerk himself, as the chief clerk was a gentleman, good and honest, but","The Trial"
"35372",7849,"he did not know what it was he could do and merely hoped there would be","The Trial"
"35373",7849,"some influential gentlemen who would take his side. I'm sure that is","The Trial"
"35374",7849,"what will happen and that everything will turn out for the best in the","The Trial"
"35375",7849,"end, but in the mean time things do not look at all good, and you can","The Trial"
"35376",7849,"see that from the mood of the chief clerk himself. Of course, I did not","The Trial"
"35377",7849,"place too much importance on this conversation, and even did my best to","The Trial"
"35378",7849,"put the bank clerk's mind at rest, he was quite a simple man. I told him","The Trial"
"35379",7849,"he was not to speak to anyone else about this, and I think it is all","The Trial"
"35380",7849,"just a rumour, but I still think it might be good if you, Dear Father,","The Trial"
"35381",7849,"if you looked into the matter the next time you visit. It will be easy","The Trial"
"35382",7849,"for you to find out more detail and, if it is really necessary, to do","The Trial"
"35383",7849,"something about it through the great and influential people you know.","The Trial"
"35384",7849,"But if it is not necessary, and that is what seems most likely, then at","The Trial"
"35385",7849,"least your daughter will soon have the chance to embrace you and I look","The Trial"
"35386",7849,"forward to it.'&mdash;She's a good child,"" said K.'s uncle when he had","The Trial"
"35387",7849,"finished reading, and wiped a few tears from his eyes. K. nodded. With","The Trial"
"35388",7849,"all the different disruptions he had had recently he had completely","The Trial"
"35389",7849,"forgotten about Erna, even her birthday, and the story of the chocolates","The Trial"
"35390",7849,"had clearly just been invented so that he wouldn't get in trouble with","The Trial"
"35391",7849,"his aunt and uncle. It was very touching, and even the theatre tickets,","The Trial"
"35392",7849,"which he would regularly send her from then on, would not be enough to","The Trial"
"35393",7849,"repay her, but he really did not feel, now, that it was right for him to","The Trial"
"35394",7849,"visit her in her lodgings and hold conversations with a little, eighteen","The Trial"
"35395",7849,"year old schoolgirl. ""And what do you have to say about that?"" asked his","The Trial"
"35396",7849,"uncle, who had forgotten all his rush and excitement as he read the","The Trial"
"35397",7849,"letter, and seemed to be about to read it again. ""Yes, Uncle,"" said K.,","The Trial"
"35398",7849,"""it is true."" ""True!"" called out his uncle. ""What is true? How can this","The Trial"
"35399",7849,"be true? What sort of trial is it? Not a criminal trial, I hope?"" ""It's","The Trial"
"35400",7849,"a criminal trial,"" answered K. ""And you sit quietly here while you've","The Trial"
"35401",7849,"got a criminal trial round your neck?"" shouted his uncle, getting ever","The Trial"
"35402",7849,"louder. ""The more calm I am, the better it will be for the outcome,""","The Trial"
"35403",7849,"said K. in a tired voice, ""don't worry."" ""How can I help worrying?!""","The Trial"
"35404",7849,"shouted his uncle, ""Josef, my dear Josef, think about yourself, about","The Trial"
"35405",7849,"your family, think about our good name! Up till now, you've always been","The Trial"
"35406",7849,"our pride, don't now become our disgrace. I don't like the way you're","The Trial"
"35407",7849,"behaving,"" he said, looking at K. with his head at an angle, ""that's not","The Trial"
"35408",7849,"how an innocent man behaves when he's accused of something, not if he's","The Trial"
"35409",7849,"still got any strength in him. Just tell me what it's all about so that","The Trial"
"35410",7849,"I can help you. It's something to do with the bank, I take it?"" ""No,""","The Trial"
"35411",7849,"said K. as he stood up, ""and you're speaking too loud, Uncle, I expect","The Trial"
"35412",7849,"one of the staff is listening at the door and I find that rather","The Trial"
"35413",7849,"unpleasant. It's best if we go somewhere else, then I can answer all","The Trial"
"35414",7849,"your questions, as far as I can. And I know very well that I have to","The Trial"
"35415",7849,"account to the family for what I do."" ""You certainly do!"" his uncle","The Trial"
"35416",7849,"shouted, ""Quite right, you do. Now just get a move on, Josef, hurry up","The Trial"
"35417",7849,"now!"" ""I still have a few documents I need to prepare,"" said K., and,","The Trial"
"35418",7849,"using the intercom, he summoned his deputy who entered a few moments","The Trial"
"35419",7849,"later. K.'s uncle, still angry and excited, gestured with his hand to","The Trial"
"35420",7849,"show that K. had summoned him, even though there was no need whatever to","The Trial"
"35421",7849,"do so. K. stood in front of the desk and explained to the young man, who","The Trial"
"35422",7849,"listened calm and attentive, what would need to be done that day in his","The Trial"
"35423",7849,"absence, speaking in a calm voice and making use of various documents.","The Trial"
"35424",7849,"The presence of K.'s uncle while this was going on was quite disturbing;","The Trial"
"35425",7849,"he did not listen to what was being said, but at first he stood there","The Trial"
"35426",7849,"with eyes wide open and nervously biting his lips. Then he began to walk","The Trial"
"35427",7849,"up and down the room, stopped now and then at the window, or stood in","The Trial"
"35428",7849,"front of a picture always making various exclamations such as, ""That is","The Trial"
"35429",7849,"totally incomprehensible to me!"" or ""Now just tell me, what are you","The Trial"
"35430",7849,"supposed to make of that?"" The young man pretended to notice nothing of","The Trial"
"35431",7849,"this and listened to K.'s instructions through to the end, he made a few","The Trial"
"35432",7849,"notes, bowed to both K. and his uncle and then left the room. K.'s uncle","The Trial"
"35433",7849,"had turned his back to him and was looking out the window, bunching up","The Trial"
"35434",7849,"the curtains with his outstretched hands. The door had hardly closed","The Trial"
"35435",7849,"when he called out, ""At last! Now that he's stopped jumping about we can","The Trial"
"35436",7849,"go too!"" Once they were in the front hall of the bank, where several","The Trial"
"35437",7849,"members of staff were standing about and where, just then, the deputy","The Trial"
"35438",7849,"director was walking across, there was unfortunately no way of stopping","The Trial"
"35439",7849,"K.'s uncle from continually asking questions about the trial. ""Now","The Trial"
"35440",7849,"then, Josef,"" he began, lightly acknowledging the bows from those around","The Trial"
"35441",7849,"them as they passed, ""tell me everything about this trial; what sort of","The Trial"
"35442",7849,"trial is it?"" K. made a few comments which conveyed little information,","The Trial"
"35443",7849,"even laughed a little, and it was only when they reached the front steps","The Trial"
"35444",7849,"that he explained to his uncle that he had not wanted to talk openly in","The Trial"
"35445",7849,"front of those people. ""Quite right,"" said his uncle, ""but now start","The Trial"
"35446",7849,"talking."" With his head to one side, and smoking his cigar in short,","The Trial"
"35447",7849,"impatient draughts, he listened. ""First of all, Uncle,"" said K., ""it's","The Trial"
"35448",7849,"not a trial like you'd have in a normal courtroom."" ""So much the worse,""","The Trial"
"35449",7849,"said his uncle. ""How's that?"" asked K., looking at him. ""What I mean is,","The Trial"
"35450",7849,"that's for the worse,"" he repeated. They were standing on the front","The Trial"
"35451",7849,"steps of the bank; as the doorkeeper seemed to be listening to what they","The Trial"
"35452",7849,"were saying K. drew his uncle down further, where they were absorbed","The Trial"
"35453",7849,"into the bustle of the street. His uncle took K.'s arm and stopped","The Trial"
"35454",7849,"asking questions with such urgency about the trial, they walked on for a","The Trial"
"35455",7849,"while in silence. ""But how did all this come about?"" he eventually","The Trial"
"35456",7849,"asked, stopping abruptly enough to startle the people walking behind,","The Trial"
"35457",7849,"who had to avoid walking into him. ""Things like this don't come all of a","The Trial"
"35458",7849,"sudden, they start developing a long time beforehand, there must have","The Trial"
"35459",7849,"been warning signs of it, why didn't you write to me? You know I'd do","The Trial"
"35460",7849,"anything for you, to some extent I am still your guardian, and until","The Trial"
"35461",7849,"today that's something I was proud of. I'll still help you, of course I","The Trial"
"35462",7849,"will, only now, now that the trial is already underway, it makes it","The Trial"
"35463",7849,"very difficult. But whatever; the best thing now is for you to take a","The Trial"
"35464",7849,"short holiday staying with us in the country. You've lost weight, I can","The Trial"
"35465",7849,"see that now. The country life will give you strength, that will be","The Trial"
"35466",7849,"good, there's bound to be a lot of hard work ahead of you. But besides","The Trial"
"35467",7849,"that it'll be a way of getting you away from the court, to some extent.","The Trial"
"35468",7849,"Here they've got every means of showing the powers at their disposal","The Trial"
"35469",7849,"and they're automatically bound to use them against you; in the country","The Trial"
"35470",7849,"they'll either have to delegate authority to different bodies or just","The Trial"
"35471",7849,"have to try and bother you by letter, telegram or telephone. And that's","The Trial"
"35472",7849,"bound to weaken the effect, it won't release you from them but it'll","The Trial"
"35473",7849,"give you room to breathe."" ""You could forbid me to leave,"" said K., who","The Trial"
"35474",7849,"had been drawn slightly into his uncle's way of thinking by what he had","The Trial"
"35475",7849,"been saying. ""I didn't think you would do it,"" said his uncle","The Trial"
"35476",7849,"thoughtfully, ""you won't suffer too much loss of power by moving away.""","The Trial"
"35477",7849,"K. grasped his uncle under the arm to prevent him stopping still and","The Trial"
"35478",7849,"said, ""I thought you'd think all this is less important than I do, and","The Trial"
"35479",7849,"now you're taking it so hard."" ""Josef,"" called his uncle trying to","The Trial"
"35480",7849,"disentangle himself from him so that he could stop walking, but K. did","The Trial"
"35481",7849,"not let go, ""you've completely changed, you used to be so astute, are","The Trial"

"35484",7849,"that everyone you know would be pulled down with you or at the very","The Trial"
"35485",7849,"least humiliated, disgraced right down to the ground. Josef, pull","The Trial"
"35486",7849,"yourself together. The way you're so indifferent about it, it's driving","The Trial"
"35487",7849,"me mad. Looking at you I can almost believe that old saying: 'Having a","The Trial"

"35489",7849,"K., ""it won't do any good to get excited, it's no good for you to do it","The Trial"

"35491",7849,"excited, and please admit that my practical experience counts for","The Trial"
"35492",7849,"something, just as I have always and still do respect your experience,","The Trial"

"35496",7849,"Only, I don't see any advantage in staying in the country, not even for","The Trial"

"35499",7849,"also press the matter forward better here."" ""You're right,"" said his","The Trial"
"35500",7849,"uncle in a tone that seemed to indicate they were finally coming closer","The Trial"
"35501",7849,"to each other, ""I just made the suggestion because, as I saw it, if you","The Trial"
"35502",7849,"stay in the city the case will be put in danger by your indifference to","The Trial"

"35518",7849,"important thing now is, we have no time to lose."" Even while he was","The Trial"
"35519",7849,"still speaking, K.'s uncle had stood on tiptoe to summon a taxi and now","The Trial"
"35520",7849,"he pulled K. into the car behind himself as he called out an address to","The Trial"
"35521",7849,"the driver. ""We're going now to see Dr. Huld, the lawyer,"" he said, ""we","The Trial"
"35522",7849,"were at school together. I'm sure you know the name, don't you? No? Well","The Trial"
"35523",7849,"that is odd. He's got a very good reputation as a defence barrister and","The Trial"
"35524",7849,"for working with the poor. But I esteem him especially as someone you","The Trial"
"35525",7849,"can trust."" ""It's alright with me, whatever you do,"" said K., although","The Trial"
"35526",7849,"he was made uneasy by the rushed and urgent way his uncle was dealing","The Trial"
"35527",7849,"with the matter. It was not very encouraging, as the accused, to be","The Trial"
"35528",7849,"taken to a lawyer for poor people. ""I didn't know,"" he said, ""that you","The Trial"
"35529",7849,"could take on a lawyer in matters like this."" ""Well of course you can,""","The Trial"
"35530",7849,"said his uncle, ""that goes without saying. Why wouldn't you take on a","The Trial"
"35531",7849,"lawyer? And now, so that I'm properly instructed in this matter, tell me","The Trial"
"35532",7849,"what's been happening so far."" K. instantly began telling his uncle","The Trial"
"35533",7849,"about what had been happening, holding nothing back&mdash;being completely","The Trial"
"35534",7849,"open with him was the only way that K. could protest at his uncle's","The Trial"
"35535",7849,"belief that the trial was a great disgrace. He mentioned Miss Bürstner's","The Trial"
"35536",7849,"name just once and in passing, but that did nothing to diminish his","The Trial"
"35537",7849,"openness about the trial as Miss Bürstner had no connection with it. As","The Trial"
"35538",7849,"he spoke, he looked out the window and saw how, just then, they were","The Trial"
"35539",7849,"getting closer to the suburb where the court offices were. He drew this","The Trial"
"35540",7849,"to his uncle's attention, but he did not find the coincidence especially","The Trial"
"35541",7849,"remarkable. The taxi stopped in front of a dark building. K.'s uncle","The Trial"
"35542",7849,"knocked at the very first door at ground level; while they waited he","The Trial"
"35543",7849,"smiled, showing his big teeth, and whispered, ""Eight o'clock; not the","The Trial"
"35544",7849,"usual sort of time to be visiting a lawyer, but Huld won't mind it from","The Trial"
"35545",7849,"me."" Two large, black eyes appeared in the spy-hatch in the door, they","The Trial"
"35546",7849,"stared at the two visitors for a while and then disappeared; the door,","The Trial"
"35547",7849,"however, did not open. K. and his uncle confirmed to each other the fact","The Trial"
"35548",7849,"that they had seen the two eyes. ""A new maid, afraid of strangers,"" said","The Trial"
"35549",7849,"K.'s uncle, and knocked again. The eyes appeared once more. This time","The Trial"
"35550",7849,"they seemed almost sad, but the open gas flame that burned with a hiss","The Trial"
"35551",7849,"close above their heads gave off little light and that may have merely","The Trial"
"35552",7849,"created an illusion. ""Open the door,"" called K.'s uncle, raising his","The Trial"
"35553",7849,"fist against it, ""we are friends of Dr. Huld, the lawyer!"" ""Dr. Huld is","The Trial"
"35554",7849,"ill,"" whispered someone behind them. In a doorway at the far end of a","The Trial"
"35555",7849,"narrow passage stood a man in his dressing gown, giving them this","The Trial"
"35556",7849,"information in an extremely quiet voice. K.'s uncle, who had already","The Trial"
"35557",7849,"been made very angry by the long wait, turned abruptly round and","The Trial"
"35558",7849,"retorted, ""Ill. You say he's ill?"" and strode towards the gentleman in a","The Trial"
"35559",7849,"way that seemed almost threatening, as if he were the illness himself.","The Trial"
"35560",7849,"""They've opened the door for you, now,"" said the gentleman, pointing at","The Trial"
"35561",7849,"the door of the lawyer. He pulled his dressing gown together and","The Trial"
"35562",7849,"disappeared. The door had indeed been opened, a young girl&mdash;K.","The Trial"
"35563",7849,"recognised the dark, slightly bulging eyes&mdash;stood in the hallway in a","The Trial"
"35564",7849,"long white apron, holding a candle in her hand. ""Next time, open up","The Trial"
"35565",7849,"sooner!"" said K.'s uncle instead of a greeting, while the girl made a","The Trial"
"35566",7849,"slight curtsey. ""Come along, Josef,"" he then said to K. who was slowly","The Trial"
"35567",7849,"moving over towards the girl. ""Dr. Huld is unwell,"" said the girl as","The Trial"
"35568",7849,"K.'s uncle, without stopping, rushed towards one of the doors. K.","The Trial"
"35569",7849,"continued to look at the girl in amazement as she turned round to block","The Trial"
"35570",7849,"the way into the living room, she had a round face like a puppy's, not","The Trial"
"35571",7849,"only the pale cheeks and the chin were round but the temples and the","The Trial"
"35572",7849,"hairline were too. ""Josef!"" called his uncle once more, and he asked the","The Trial"
"35573",7849,"girl, ""It's trouble with his heart, is it?"" ""I think it is, sir,"" said","The Trial"
"35574",7849,"the girl, who by now had found time to go ahead with the candle and open","The Trial"
"35575",7849,"the door into the room. In one corner of the room, where the light of","The Trial"
"35576",7849,"the candle did not reach, a face with a long beard looked up from the","The Trial"
"35577",7849,"bed. ""Leni, who's this coming in?"" asked the lawyer, unable to recognise","The Trial"
"35578",7849,"his guests because he was dazzled by the candle. ""It's your old friend,","The Trial"
"35579",7849,"Albert,"" said K.'s uncle. ""Oh, Albert,"" said the lawyer, falling back","The Trial"
"35580",7849,"onto his pillow as if this visit meant he would not need to keep up","The Trial"
"35581",7849,"appearances. ""Is it really as bad as that?"" asked K.'s uncle, sitting on","The Trial"
"35582",7849,"the edge of the bed. ""I don't believe it is. It's a recurrence of your","The Trial"
"35583",7849,"heart trouble and it'll pass over like the other times."" ""Maybe,"" said","The Trial"
"35584",7849,"the lawyer quietly, ""but it's just as much trouble as it's ever been. I","The Trial"
"35585",7849,"can hardly breathe, I can't sleep at all and I'm getting weaker by the","The Trial"
"35586",7849,"day."" ""I see,"" said K.'s uncle, pressing his panama hat firmly against","The Trial"
"35587",7849,"his knee with his big hand. ""That is bad news. But are you getting the","The Trial"
"35588",7849,"right sort of care? And it's so depressing in here, it's so dark. It's a","The Trial"
"35589",7849,"long time since I was last here, but it seemed to me friendlier then.","The Trial"
"35590",7849,"Even your young lady here doesn't seem to have much life in her, unless","The Trial"
"35591",7849,"she's just pretending."" The maid was still standing by the door with the","The Trial"
"35592",7849,"candle; as far as could be made out, she was watching K. more than she","The Trial"
"35593",7849,"was watching his uncle even while the latter was still speaking about","The Trial"
"35594",7849,"her. K. leant against a chair that he had pushed near to the girl. ""When","The Trial"
"35595",7849,"you're as ill as I am,"" said the lawyer, ""you need to have peace. I","The Trial"
"35596",7849,"don't find it depressing."" After a short pause he added, ""and Leni looks","The Trial"
"35597",7849,"after me well, she's a good girl."" But that was not enough to persuade","The Trial"
"35598",7849,"K.'s uncle, he had visibly taken against his friend's carer and, even","The Trial"
"35599",7849,"though he did not contradict the invalid, he persecuted her with his","The Trial"
"35600",7849,"scowl as she went over to the bed, put the candle on the bedside table","The Trial"
"35601",7849,"and, leaning over the bed, made a fuss of him by tidying the pillows.","The Trial"
"35602",7849,"K.'s uncle nearly forgot the need to show any consideration for the man","The Trial"
"35603",7849,"who lay ill in bed, he stood up, walked up and down behind the carer,","The Trial"
"35604",7849,"and K. would not have been surprised if he had grabbed hold of her","The Trial"
"35605",7849,"skirts behind her and dragged her away from the bed. K. himself looked","The Trial"
"35606",7849,"on calmly, he was not even disappointed at finding the lawyer unwell,","The Trial"
"35607",7849,"he had been able to do nothing to oppose the enthusiasm his uncle had","The Trial"
"35608",7849,"developed for the matter, he was glad that this enthusiasm had now been","The Trial"
"35609",7849,"distracted without his having to do anything about it. His uncle,","The Trial"
"35610",7849,"probably simply wishing to be offensive to the lawyer's attendant, then","The Trial"
"35611",7849,"said, ""Young lady, now please leave us alone for a while, I have some","The Trial"
"35612",7849,"personal matters to discuss with my friend."" Dr. Huld's carer was still","The Trial"
"35613",7849,"leant far over the invalid's bed and smoothing out the cloth covering","The Trial"
"35614",7849,"the wall next to it, she merely turned her head and then, in striking","The Trial"
"35615",7849,"contrast with the anger that first stopped K.'s uncle from speaking and","The Trial"
"35616",7849,"then let the words out in a gush, she said very quietly, ""You can see","The Trial"
"35617",7849,"that Dr. Huld is so ill that he can't discuss any matters at all."" It","The Trial"
"35618",7849,"was probably just for the sake of convenience that she had repeated the","The Trial"
"35619",7849,"words spoken by K.'s uncle, but an onlooker might even have perceived","The Trial"
"35620",7849,"it as mocking him and he, of course, jumped up as if he had just been","The Trial"
"35621",7849,"stabbed. ""You damned ...,"" in the first gurglings of his excitement his","The Trial"
"35622",7849,"words could hardly be understood, K. was startled even though he had","The Trial"
"35623",7849,"been expecting something of the sort and ran to his uncle with the","The Trial"
"35624",7849,"intention, no doubt, of closing his mouth with both his hands.","The Trial"
"35625",7849,"Fortunately, though, behind the girl, the invalid raised himself up,","The Trial"
"35626",7849,"K.'s uncle made an ugly face as if swallowing something disgusting and","The Trial"
"35627",7849,"then, somewhat calmer, said, ""We have naturally not lost our senses,","The Trial"
"35628",7849,"not yet; if what I am asking for were not possible I would not be asking","The Trial"
"35629",7849,"for it. Now please, go!"" The carer stood up straight by the bed","The Trial"
"35630",7849,"directly facing K.'s uncle, K. thought he noticed that with one hand she","The Trial"
"35631",7849,"was stroking the lawyer's hand. ""You can say anything in front of","The Trial"
"35632",7849,"Leni,"" said the invalid, in a tone that was unmistakably imploring.","The Trial"
"35633",7849,"""It's not my business,"" said K.'s uncle, ""and it's not my secrets."" And","The Trial"
"35634",7849,"he twisted himself round as if wanting to go into no more negotiations","The Trial"
"35635",7849,"but giving himself a little more time to think. ""Whose business is it","The Trial"
"35636",7849,"then?"" asked the lawyer in an exhausted voice as he leant back again.","The Trial"
"35637",7849,"""My nephew's,"" said K.'s uncle, ""and I've brought him along with me.""","The Trial"
"35638",7849,"And he introduced him, ""Chief Clerk Josef K."" ""Oh!"" said the invalid,","The Trial"
"35639",7849,"now with much more life in him, and reached out his hand towards K. ""Do","The Trial"
"35640",7849,"forgive me, I didn't notice you there at all."" Then he then said to his","The Trial"
"35641",7849,"carer, ""Leni, go,"" stretching his hand out to her as if this were a","The Trial"
"35642",7849,"farewell that would have to last for a long time. This time the girl","The Trial"
"35643",7849,"offered no resistance. ""So you,"" he finally said to K.'s uncle, who had","The Trial"
"35644",7849,"also calmed down and stepped closer, ""you haven't come to visit me","The Trial"
"35645",7849,"because I'm ill but you've come on business."" The lawyer now looked so","The Trial"
"35646",7849,"much stronger that it seemed the idea of being visited because he was","The Trial"
"35647",7849,"ill had somehow made him weak, he remained supporting himself on one","The Trial"
"35648",7849,"elbow, which must have been rather tiring, and continually pulled at a","The Trial"
"35649",7849,"lock of hair in the middle of his beard. ""You already look much better,""","The Trial"
"35650",7849,"said K.'s uncle, ""now that that witch has gone outside."" He interrupted","The Trial"
"35651",7849,"himself, whispered, ""I bet you she's listening!"" and sprang over to the","The Trial"
"35652",7849,"door. But behind the door there was no-one, K.'s uncle came back not","The Trial"
"35653",7849,"disappointed, as her not listening seemed to him worse than if she had","The Trial"
"35654",7849,"been, but probably somewhat embittered. ""You're mistaken about her,""","The Trial"
"35655",7849,"said the lawyer, but did nothing more to defend her; perhaps that was","The Trial"
"35656",7849,"his way of indicating that she did not need defending. But in a tone","The Trial"
"35657",7849,"that was much more committed he went on, ""As far as your nephew's","The Trial"
"35658",7849,"affairs are concerned, this will be an extremely difficult undertaking","The Trial"
"35659",7849,"and I'd count myself lucky if my strength lasted out long enough for it;","The Trial"
"35660",7849,"I'm greatly afraid it won't do, but anyway I don't want to leave","The Trial"
"35661",7849,"anything untried; if I don't last out you can always get somebody else.","The Trial"
"35662",7849,"To be honest, this matter interests me too much, and I can't bring","The Trial"
"35663",7849,"myself to give up the chance of taking some part in it. If my heart does","The Trial"
"35664",7849,"totally give out then at least it will have found a worthy affair to","The Trial"
"35665",7849,"fail in."" K. believed he understood not a word of this entire speech, he","The Trial"
"35666",7849,"looked at his uncle for an explanation but his uncle sat on the bedside","The Trial"
"35667",7849,"table with the candle in his hand, a medicine bottle had rolled off the","The Trial"
"35668",7849,"table onto the floor, he nodded to everything the lawyer said, agreed to","The Trial"
"35669",7849,"everything, and now and then looked at K. urging him to show the same","The Trial"
"35670",7849,"compliance. Maybe K.'s uncle had already told the lawyer about the","The Trial"
"35671",7849,"trial. But that was impossible, everything that had happened so far","The Trial"
"35672",7849,"spoke against it. So he said, ""I don't understand...."" ""Well, maybe I've","The Trial"
"35673",7849,"misunderstood what you've been saying,"" said the lawyer, just as","The Trial"
"35674",7849,"astonished and embarrassed as K. ""Perhaps I've been going too fast. What","The Trial"
"35675",7849,"was it you wanted to speak to me about? I thought it was to do with your","The Trial"
"35676",7849,"trial."" ""Of course it is,"" said K.'s uncle, who then asked K., ""So what","The Trial"
"35677",7849,"is it you want?"" ""Yes, but how is it that you know anything about me and","The Trial"
"35678",7849,"my case?"" asked K. ""Oh, I see,"" said the lawyer with a smile. ""I am a","The Trial"
"35679",7849,"lawyer, I move in court circles, people talk about various different","The Trial"
"35680",7849,"cases and the more interesting ones stay in your mind, especially when","The Trial"
"35681",7849,"they concern the nephew of a friend. There's nothing very remarkable","The Trial"
"35682",7849,"about that."" ""What is it you want, then?"" asked K.'s uncle once more,","The Trial"
"35683",7849,"""You seem so uneasy about it."" ""You move in this court's circles?"" asked","The Trial"
"35684",7849,"K. ""Yes,"" said the lawyer. ""You're asking questions like a child,"" said","The Trial"
"35685",7849,"K.'s uncle. ""What circles should I move in, then, if not with members of","The Trial"
"35686",7849,"my own discipline?"" the lawyer added. It sounded so indisputable that K.","The Trial"
"35687",7849,"gave no answer at all. ""But you work in the High Court, not that court","The Trial"
"35688",7849,"in the attic,"" he had wanted to say but could not bring himself to","The Trial"
"35689",7849,"actually utter it. ""You have to realise,"" the lawyer continued, in a","The Trial"
"35690",7849,"tone as if he were explaining something obvious, unnecessary and","The Trial"
"35691",7849,"incidental, ""you have to realise that I also derive great advantage for","The Trial"
"35692",7849,"my clients from mixing with those people, and do so in many different","The Trial"
"35693",7849,"ways, it's not something you can keep talking about all the time. I'm at","The Trial"
"35694",7849,"a bit of a disadvantage now, of course, because of my illness, but I","The Trial"
"35695",7849,"still get visits from some good friends of mine at the court and I learn","The Trial"
"35696",7849,"one or two things. It might even be that I learn more than many of those","The Trial"
"35697",7849,"who are in the best of health and spend all day in court. And I'm","The Trial"
"35698",7849,"receiving a very welcome visit right now, for instance."" And he pointed","The Trial"
"35699",7849,"into a dark corner of the room. ""Where?"" asked K., almost uncouth in","The Trial"
"35700",7849,"his surprise. He looked round uneasily; the little candle gave off far","The Trial"
"35701",7849,"too little light to reach as far as the wall opposite. And then,","The Trial"
"35702",7849,"something did indeed begin to move there in the corner. In the light of","The Trial"
"35703",7849,"the candle held up by K.'s uncle an elderly gentleman could be seen","The Trial"
"35704",7849,"sitting beside a small table. He had been sitting there for so long","The Trial"
"35705",7849,"without being noticed that he could hardly have been breathing. Now he","The Trial"
"35706",7849,"stood up with a great deal of fuss, clearly unhappy that attention had","The Trial"
"35707",7849,"been drawn to him. It was as if, by flapping his hands about like short","The Trial"
"35708",7849,"wings, he hoped to deflect any introductions and greetings, as if he","The Trial"
"35709",7849,"wanted on no account to disturb the others by his presence and seemed to","The Trial"
"35710",7849,"be exhorting them to leave him back in the dark and forget about his","The Trial"
"35711",7849,"being there. That, however, was something that could no longer be","The Trial"
"35712",7849,"granted him. ""You took us by surprise, you see,"" said the lawyer in","The Trial"
"35713",7849,"explanation, cheerfully indicating to the gentleman that he should come","The Trial"
"35714",7849,"closer, which, slowly, hesitatingly, looking all around him, but with a","The Trial"
"35715",7849,"certain dignity, he did. ""The office director&mdash;oh, yes, forgive me, I","The Trial"
"35716",7849,"haven't introduced you&mdash;this is my friend Albert K., this is his nephew,","The Trial"
"35717",7849,"the chief clerk Josef K., and this is the office director&mdash;so, the","The Trial"
"35718",7849,"office director was kind enough to pay me a visit. It's only possible","The Trial"
"35719",7849,"to appreciate just how valuable a visit like this is if you've been let","The Trial"
"35720",7849,"into the secret of what a pile of work the office director has heaped","The Trial"
"35721",7849,"over him. Well, he came anyway, we were having a peaceful chat, as far","The Trial"
"35722",7849,"as I was able when I'm so weak, and although we hadn't told Leni she","The Trial"
"35723",7849,"mustn't let anyone in as we weren't expecting anyone, we still would","The Trial"
"35724",7849,"rather have remained alone, but then along came you, Albert, thumping","The Trial"
"35725",7849,"your fists on the door, the office director moved over into the corner","The Trial"
"35726",7849,"pulling his table and chair with him, but now it turns out we might","The Trial"
"35727",7849,"have, that is, if that's what you wish, we might have something to","The Trial"
"35728",7849,"discuss with each other and it would be good if we can all come back","The Trial"
"35729",7849,"together again.&mdash;Office director ...,"" he said with his head on one","The Trial"
"35730",7849,"side, pointing with a humble smile to an armchair near the bed. ""I'm","The Trial"
"35731",7849,"afraid I'll only be able to stay a few minutes more,"" smiled the office","The Trial"
"35732",7849,"director as he spread himself out in the armchair and looked at the","The Trial"
"35733",7849,"clock. ""Business calls. But I wouldn't want to miss the chance of","The Trial"
"35734",7849,"meeting a friend of my friend."" He inclined his head slightly toward","The Trial"
"35735",7849,"K.'s uncle, who seemed very happy with his new acquaintance, but he was","The Trial"
"35736",7849,"not the sort of person to express his feelings of deference and","The Trial"
"35737",7849,"responded to the office director's words with embarrassed, but loud,","The Trial"
"35738",7849,"laughter. A horrible sight! K. was able to quietly watch everything as","The Trial"
"35739",7849,"nobody paid any attention to him, the office director took over as","The Trial"
"35740",7849,"leader of the conversation as seemed to be his habit once he had been","The Trial"
"35741",7849,"called forward, the lawyer listened attentively with his hand to his","The Trial"
"35742",7849,"ear, his initial weakness having perhaps only had the function of","The Trial"
"35743",7849,"driving away his new visitors. K.'s uncle served as","The Trial"
"35744",7849,"candle-bearer&mdash;balancing the candle on his thigh while the office","The Trial"
"35745",7849,"director frequently glanced nervously at it&mdash;and was soon free of his","The Trial"
"35746",7849,"embarrassment and was quickly enchanted not only by the office","The Trial"
"35747",7849,"director's speaking manner but also by the gentle, waving","The Trial"
"35748",7849,"hand-movements with which he accompanied it. K., leaning against the","The Trial"
"35749",7849,"bedpost, was totally ignored by the office director, perhaps","The Trial"
"35750",7849,"deliberately, and served the old man only as audience. And besides, he","The Trial"
"35751",7849,"had hardly any idea what the conversation was about and his thoughts","The Trial"
"35752",7849,"soon turned to the care assistant and the ill treatment she had suffered","The Trial"
"35753",7849,"from his uncle. Soon after, he began to wonder whether he had not seen","The Trial"
"35754",7849,"the office director somewhere before, perhaps among the people who were","The Trial"
"35755",7849,"at his first hearing. He may have been mistaken, but thought the office","The Trial"
"35756",7849,"director might well have been among the old gentlemen with the thin","The Trial"
"35757",7849,"beards in the first row.</p>","The Trial"
"35758",7849,"","The Trial"
"35759",7849,"<p>There was then a noise that everyone heard from the hallway as if","The Trial"
"35760",7849,"something of porcelain were being broken. ""I'll go and see what's","The Trial"
"35761",7849,"happened,"" said K., who slowly left the room as if giving the others","The Trial"
"35762",7849,"the chance to stop him. He had hardly stepped into the hallway, finding","The Trial"
"35763",7849,"his bearings in the darkness with his hand still firmly holding the","The Trial"
"35764",7849,"door, when another small hand, much smaller than K.'s own, placed itself","The Trial"
"35765",7849,"on his and gently shut the door. It was the carer who had been waiting","The Trial"
"35766",7849,"there. ""Nothing has happened,"" she whispered to him, ""I just threw a","The Trial"
"35767",7849,"plate against the wall to get you out of there."" ""I was thinking about","The Trial"
"35768",7849,"you, as well,"" replied K. uneasily. ""So much the better,"" said the","The Trial"
"35769",7849,"carer. ""Come with me."" A few steps along, they came to a frosted glass","The Trial"
"35770",7849,"door which the carer opened for him. ""Come in here,"" she said. It was","The Trial"
"35771",7849,"clearly the lawyer's office, fitted out with old, heavy furniture, as","The Trial"
"35772",7849,"far as could be seen in the moonlight which now illuminated just a","The Trial"
"35773",7849,"small, rectangular section of the floor by each of the three big","The Trial"
"35774",7849,"windows. ""This way,"" said the carer, pointing to a dark trunk with a","The Trial"
"35775",7849,"carved, wooden backrest. When he had sat down, K. continued to look","The Trial"
"35776",7849,"round the room, it was a large room with a high ceiling, the clients of","The Trial"
"35777",7849,"this lawyer for the poor must have felt quite lost in it. K. thought he","The Trial"
"35778",7849,"could see the little steps with which visitors would approach the","The Trial"
"35779",7849,"massive desk. But then he forgot about all of this and had eyes only","The Trial"
"35780",7849,"for the carer who sat very close beside him, almost pressing him against","The Trial"
"35781",7849,"the armrest. ""I did think,"" she said, ""you would come out here to me by","The Trial"
"35782",7849,"yourself without me having to call you first. It was odd. First you","The Trial"
"35783",7849,"stare at me as soon as you come in, and then you keep me waiting. And","The Trial"
"35784",7849,"you ought to call me Leni, too,"" she added quickly and suddenly, as if","The Trial"
"35785",7849,"no moment of this conversation should be lost. ""Gladly,"" said K. ""But","The Trial"
"35786",7849,"as for its being odd, Leni, that's easy to explain. Firstly, I had to","The Trial"
"35787",7849,"listen to what the old men were saying and couldn't leave without a","The Trial"
"35788",7849,"good reason, but secondly I'm not a bold person, if anything I'm quite","The Trial"
"35789",7849,"shy, and you, Leni, you didn't really look like you could be won over in","The Trial"
"35790",7849,"one stroke, either."" ""That's not it,"" said Leni, laying one arm on the","The Trial"
"35791",7849,"armrest and looking at K., ""you didn't like me, and I don't suppose you","The Trial"
"35792",7849,"like me now, either."" ""Liking wouldn't be very much,"" said K.,","The Trial"
"35793",7849,"evasively. ""Oh!"" she exclaimed with a smile, thus making use of K.'s","The Trial"
"35794",7849,"comment to gain an advantage over him. So K. remained silent for a","The Trial"
"35795",7849,"while. By now, he had become used to the darkness in the room and was","The Trial"
"35796",7849,"able to make out various fixtures and fittings. He was especially","The Trial"
"35797",7849,"impressed by a large picture hanging to the right of the door, he leant","The Trial"
"35798",7849,"forward in order to see it better. It depicted a man wearing a judge's","The Trial"
"35799",7849,"robes; he was sitting on a lofty throne gilded in a way that shone","The Trial"
"35800",7849,"forth from the picture. The odd thing about the picture was that this","The Trial"
"35801",7849,"judge was not sitting there in dignified calm but had his left arm","The Trial"
"35802",7849,"pressed against the back and armrest, his right arm, however, was","The Trial"
"35803",7849,"completely free and only grasped the armrest with his hand, as if about","The Trial"
"35804",7849,"to jump up any moment in vigorous outrage and make some decisive comment","The Trial"
"35805",7849,"or even to pass sentence. The accused was probably meant to be imagined","The Trial"
"35806",7849,"at the foot of the steps, the top one of which could be seen in the","The Trial"
"35807",7849,"picture, covered with a yellow carpet. ""That might be my judge,"" said","The Trial"
"35808",7849,"K., pointing to the picture with one finger. ""I know him,"" said Leni","The Trial"
"35809",7849,"looking up at the picture, ""he comes here quite often. That picture is","The Trial"
"35810",7849,"from when he was young, but he can never have looked anything like it,","The Trial"
"35811",7849,"as he's tiny, minute almost. But despite that, he had himself made to","The Trial"
"35812",7849,"look bigger in the picture as he's madly vain, just like everyone round","The Trial"
"35813",7849,"here. But even I'm vain and that makes me very unhappy that you don't","The Trial"
"35814",7849,"like me."" K. replied to that last comment merely by embracing Leni and","The Trial"
"35815",7849,"drawing her towards him, she lay her head quietly on his shoulder. To","The Trial"
"35816",7849,"the rest of it, though, he said, ""What rank is he?"" ""He's an examining","The Trial"
"35817",7849,"judge,"" she said, taking hold of the hand with which K. held her and","The Trial"
"35818",7849,"playing with his fingers. ""Just an examining judge once again,"" said K.","The Trial"
"35819",7849,"in disappointment, ""the senior officials keep themselves hidden. But","The Trial"
"35820",7849,"here he is sitting on a throne."" ""That's all just made up,"" said Leni","The Trial"
"35821",7849,"with her face bent over K.'s hand, ""really he's sitting on a kitchen","The Trial"
"35822",7849,"chair with an old horse blanket folded over it. But do you have to be","The Trial"
"35823",7849,"always thinking about your trial?"" she added slowly. ""No, not at all,""","The Trial"
"35824",7849,"said K., ""I probably even think too little about it."" ""That's not the","The Trial"
"35825",7849,"mistake you're making,"" said Leni, ""you're too unyielding, that's what","The Trial"
"35826",7849,"I've heard."" ""Who said that?"" asked K., he felt her body against his","The Trial"
"35827",7849,"chest and looked down on her rich, dark, tightly-bound hair. ""I'd be","The Trial"
"35828",7849,"saying too much if I told you that,"" answered Leni. ""Please don't ask","The Trial"
"35829",7849,"for names, but do stop making these mistakes of yours, stop being so","The Trial"
"35830",7849,"unyielding, there's nothing you can do to defend yourself from this","The Trial"
"35831",7849,"court, you have to confess. So confess to them as soon as you get the","The Trial"
"35832",7849,"chance. It's only then that they give you the chance to get away, not","The Trial"
"35833",7849,"till then. Only, without help from outside even that's impossible, but","The Trial"
"35834",7849,"you needn't worry about getting this help as I want to help you","The Trial"
"35835",7849,"myself."" ""You understand a lot about this court and what sort of tricks","The Trial"
"35836",7849,"are needed,"" said K. as he lifted her, since she was pressing in much","The Trial"
"35837",7849,"too close to him, onto his lap. ""That's alright, then,"" she said, and","The Trial"
"35838",7849,"made herself comfortable on his lap by smoothing out her skirt and","The Trial"
"35839",7849,"adjusting her blouse. Then she hung both her arms around his neck, leant","The Trial"
"35840",7849,"back and took a long look at him. ""And what if I don't confess, could","The Trial"
"35841",7849,"you not help me then?"" asked K. to test her out. I'm accumulating women","The Trial"
"35842",7849,"to help me, he thought to himself almost in amazement, first Miss","The Trial"
"35843",7849,"Bürstner, then the court usher's wife, and now this little care","The Trial"
"35844",7849,"assistant who seems to have some incomprehensible need for me. The way","The Trial"
"35845",7849,"she sits on my lap as if it were her proper place! ""No,"" answered Leni,","The Trial"
"35846",7849,"slowly shaking her head, ""I couldn't help you then. But you don't want","The Trial"
"35847",7849,"my help anyway, it means nothing to you, you're too stubborn and won't","The Trial"
"35848",7849,"be persuaded."" Then, after a while she asked, ""Do you have a lover?""","The Trial"
"35849",7849,"""No,"" said K. ""Oh, you must have,"" she said. ""Well, I have really,"" said","The Trial"
"35850",7849,"K. ""Just think, I've even betrayed her while I'm carrying her photograph","The Trial"
"35851",7849,"with me."" Leni insisted he show her a photograph of Elsa, and then,","The Trial"
"35852",7849,"hunched on his lap, studied the picture closely. The photograph was not","The Trial"
"35853",7849,"one that had been taken while Elsa was posing for it, it showed her just","The Trial"
"35854",7849,"after she had been in a wild dance such as she liked to do in wine bars,","The Trial"
"35855",7849,"her skirt was still flung out as she span round, she had placed her","The Trial"
"35856",7849,"hands on her firm hips and, with her neck held taut, looked to one side","The Trial"
"35857",7849,"with a laugh; you could not see from the picture whom her laugh was","The Trial"
"35858",7849,"intended for. ""She's very tightly laced,"" said Leni, pointing to the","The Trial"
"35859",7849,"place where she thought this could be seen. ""I don't like her, she's","The Trial"
"35860",7849,"clumsy and crude. But maybe she's gentle and friendly towards you,","The Trial"
"35861",7849,"that's the impression you get from the picture. Big, strong girls like","The Trial"
"35862",7849,"that often don't know how to be anything but gentle and friendly. Would","The Trial"
"35863",7849,"she be capable of sacrificing herself for you, though?"" ""No,"" said K.,","The Trial"
"35864",7849,"""she isn't gentle or friendly, and nor would she be capable of","The Trial"
"35865",7849,"sacrificing herself for me. But I've never yet asked any of those things","The Trial"
"35866",7849,"of her. I've never looked at this picture as closely as you."" ""You can't","The Trial"
"35867",7849,"think much of her, then,"" said Leni. ""She can't be your lover after","The Trial"
"35868",7849,"all."" ""Yes she is,"" said K., ""I'm not going to take my word back on","The Trial"
"35869",7849,"that."" ""Well she might be your lover now, then,"" said Leni, ""but you","The Trial"
"35870",7849,"wouldn't miss her much if you lost her or if you exchanged her for","The Trial"
"35871",7849,"somebody else, me for instance."" ""That is certainly conceivable,"" said","The Trial"
"35872",7849,"K. with a smile, ""but she does have one major advantage over you, she","The Trial"
"35873",7849,"knows nothing about my trial, and even if she did she wouldn't think","The Trial"
"35874",7849,"about it. She wouldn't try to persuade me to be less unyielding."" ""Well","The Trial"
"35875",7849,"that's no advantage,"" said Leni. ""If she's got no advantage other than","The Trial"
"35876",7849,"that, I can keep on hoping. Has she got any bodily defects?"" ""'Bodily","The Trial"
"35877",7849,"defects'?"" asked K. ""Yeah,"" said Leni, ""as I do have a bodily defect,","The Trial"
"35878",7849,"just a little one. Look."" She spread the middle and ring fingers of her","The Trial"
"35879",7849,"right hand apart from each other. Between those fingers the flap of skin","The Trial"
"35880",7849,"connecting them reached up almost as far as the top joint of the little","The Trial"
"35881",7849,"finger. In the darkness, K. did not see at first what it was she wanted","The Trial"
"35882",7849,"to show him, so she led his hand to it so that he could feel. ""What a","The Trial"
"35883",7849,"freak of nature,"" said K., and when he had taken a look at the whole","The Trial"
"35884",7849,"hand he added, ""What a pretty claw!"" Leni looked on with a kind of pride","The Trial"
"35885",7849,"as K. repeatedly opened and closed her two fingers in amazement, until,","The Trial"
"35886",7849,"finally, he briefly kissed them and let go. ""Oh!"" she immediately","The Trial"
"35887",7849,"exclaimed, ""you kissed me!"" Hurriedly, and with her mouth open, she","The Trial"
"35888",7849,"clambered up K.'s lap with her knees. He was almost aghast as he looked","The Trial"
"35889",7849,"up at her, now that she was so close to him there was a bitter,","The Trial"
"35890",7849,"irritating smell from her, like pepper, she grasped his head, leant out","The Trial"
"35891",7849,"over him, and bit and kissed his neck, even biting into his hair. ""I've","The Trial"
"35892",7849,"taken her place!"" she exclaimed from time to time. ""Just look, now","The Trial"
"35893",7849,"you've taken me instead of her!"" Just then, her knee slipped out and,","The Trial"
"35894",7849,"with a little cry, she nearly fell down onto the carpet, K. tried to","The Trial"
"35895",7849,"hold her by putting his arms around her and was pulled down with her.","The Trial"
"35896",7849,"""Now you're mine,"" she said. Her last words to him as he left were,","The Trial"
"35897",7849,"""Here's the key to the door, come whenever you want,"" and she planted an","The Trial"
"35898",7849,"undirected kiss on his back. When he stepped out the front door there","The Trial"
"35899",7849,"was a light rain falling, he was about to go to the middle of the street","The Trial"
"35900",7849,"to see if he could still glimpse Leni at the window when K.'s uncle","The Trial"
"35901",7849,"leapt out of a car that K., thinking of other things, had not seen","The Trial"
"35902",7849,"waiting outside the building. He took hold of K. by both arms and shoved","The Trial"
"35903",7849,"him against the door as if he wanted to nail him to it. ""Young man,"" he","The Trial"
"35904",7849,"shouted, ""how could you do a thing like that?! Things were going well","The Trial"
"35905",7849,"with this business of yours, now you've caused it terrible damage. You","The Trial"
"35906",7849,"slip off with some dirty, little thing who, moreover, is obviously the","The Trial"
"35907",7849,"lawyer's beloved, and stay away for hours. You don't even try to find an","The Trial"
"35908",7849,"excuse, don't try to hide anything, no, you're quite open about it, you","The Trial"
"35909",7849,"run off with her and stay there. And meanwhile we're sitting there, your","The Trial"
"35910",7849,"uncle who's going to such effort for you, the lawyer who needs to be won","The Trial"
"35911",7849,"over to your side, and above all the office director, a very important","The Trial"
"35912",7849,"gentleman who is in direct command of your affair in its present stage.","The Trial"
"35913",7849,"We wanted to discuss how best to help you, I had to handle the lawyer","The Trial"
"35914",7849,"very carefully, he had to handle the office director carefully, and you","The Trial"
"35915",7849,"had most reason of all to at least give me some support. Instead of","The Trial"
"35916",7849,"which you stay away. Eventually we couldn't keep up the pretence any","The Trial"
"35917",7849,"longer, but these are polite and highly capable men, they didn't say","The Trial"
"35918",7849,"anything about it so as to spare my feelings but in the end not even","The Trial"
"35919",7849,"they could continue to force themselves and, as they couldn't speak","The Trial"
"35920",7849,"about the matter in hand, they became silent. We sat there for several","The Trial"
"35921",7849,"minutes, listening to see whether you wouldn't finally come back. All in","The Trial"
"35922",7849,"vain. In the end the office director stood up, as he had stayed far","The Trial"
"35923",7849,"longer than he had originally intended, made his farewell, looked at me","The Trial"
"35924",7849,"in sympathy without being able to help, he waited at the door for a long","The Trial"
"35925",7849,"time although it's more than I can understand why he was being so good,","The Trial"
"35926",7849,"and then he went. I, of course, was glad he'd gone, I'd been holding my","The Trial"

"35990",7849,"clear to K. that the first documents submitted are sometimes not even","The Trial"
"35991",7849,"read by the court. They simply put them with the other documents and","The Trial"
"35992",7849,"point out that, for the time being, questioning and observing the","The Trial"
"35993",7849,"accused are much more important than anything written. If the applicant","The Trial"
"35994",7849,"becomes insistent, then they add that before they come to any decision,","The Trial"
"35995",7849,"as soon as all the material has been brought together, with due regard,","The Trial"
"35996",7849,"of course, to all the documents, then these first documents to have been","The Trial"
"35997",7849,"submitted will also be checked over. But unfortunately, even this is not","The Trial"
"35998",7849,"usually true, the first documents submitted are usually mislaid or lost","The Trial"
"35999",7849,"completely, and even if they do keep them right to the end they are","The Trial"
"36000",7849,"hardly read, although the lawyer only knew about this from rumour. This","The Trial"
"36001",7849,"is all very regrettable, but not entirely without its justifications.","The Trial"
"36002",7849,"But K. should not forget that the trial would not be public, if the","The Trial"
"36003",7849,"court deems it necessary it can be made public but there is no law that","The Trial"
"36004",7849,"says it has to be. As a result, the accused and his defence don't have","The Trial"
"36005",7849,"access even to the court records, and especially not to the indictment,","The Trial"
"36006",7849,"and that means we generally don't know&mdash;or at least not precisely&mdash;what","The Trial"
"36007",7849,"the first documents need to be about, which means that if they do","The Trial"
"36008",7849,"contain anything of relevance to the case it's only by a lucky","The Trial"
"36009",7849,"coincidence. If anything about the individual charges and the reasons","The Trial"
"36010",7849,"for them comes out clearly or can be guessed at while the accused is","The Trial"
"36011",7849,"being questioned, then it's possible to work out and submit documents","The Trial"
"36012",7849,"that really direct the issue and present proof, but not before.","The Trial"
"36013",7849,"Conditions like this, of course, place the defence in a very","The Trial"
"36014",7849,"unfavourable and difficult position. But that is what they intend. In","The Trial"
"36015",7849,"fact, defence is not really allowed under the law, it's only tolerated,","The Trial"
"36016",7849,"and there is even some dispute about whether the relevant parts of the","The Trial"
"36017",7849,"law imply even that. So strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a","The Trial"
"36018",7849,"counsel acknowledged by the court, and anyone who comes before this","The Trial"
"36019",7849,"court as counsel is basically no more than a barrack room lawyer. The","The Trial"
"36020",7849,"effect of all this, of course, is to remove the dignity of the whole","The Trial"
"36021",7849,"procedure, the next time K. is in the court offices he might like to","The Trial"
"36022",7849,"have a look in at the lawyers' room, just so that he's seen it. He might","The Trial"
"36023",7849,"well be quite shocked by the people he sees assembled there. The room","The Trial"
"36024",7849,"they've been allocated, with its narrow space and low ceiling, will be","The Trial"
"36025",7849,"enough to show what contempt the court has for these people. The only","The Trial"
"36026",7849,"light in the room comes through a little window that is so high up that,","The Trial"
"36027",7849,"if you want to look out of it, you first have to get one of your","The Trial"
"36028",7849,"colleagues to support you on his back, and even then the smoke from the","The Trial"
"36029",7849,"chimney just in front of it will go up your nose and make your face","The Trial"
"36030",7849,"black. In the floor of this room&mdash;to give yet another example of the","The Trial"
"36031",7849,"conditions there&mdash;there is a hole that's been there for more than a","The Trial"
"36032",7849,"year, it's not so big that a man could fall through, but it is big","The Trial"
"36033",7849,"enough for your foot to disappear through it. The lawyers' room is on","The Trial"
"36034",7849,"the second floor of the attic; if your foot does go through it will hang","The Trial"
"36035",7849,"down into the first floor of the attic underneath it, and right in the","The Trial"
"36036",7849,"corridor where the litigants are waiting. It's no exaggeration when","The Trial"
"36037",7849,"lawyers say that conditions like that are a disgrace. Complaints to the","The Trial"
"36038",7849,"management don't have the slightest effect, but the lawyers are strictly","The Trial"
"36039",7849,"forbidden to alter anything in the room at their own expense. But even","The Trial"
"36040",7849,"treating the lawyers in this way has its reasons. They want, as far as","The Trial"
"36041",7849,"possible, to prevent any kind of defence, everything should be made the","The Trial"
"36042",7849,"responsibility of the accused. Not a bad point of view, basically, but","The Trial"
"36043",7849,"nothing could be more mistaken than to think from that that lawyers are","The Trial"
"36044",7849,"not necessary for the accused in this court. On the contrary, there is","The Trial"
"36045",7849,"no court where they are less needed than here. This is because","The Trial"
"36046",7849,"proceedings are generally kept secret not only from the public but also","The Trial"
"36047",7849,"from the accused. Only as far as that is possible, of course, but it is","The Trial"
"36048",7849,"possible to a very large extent. And the accused doesn't get to see the","The Trial"
"36049",7849,"court records either, and it's very difficult to infer what's in the","The Trial"
"36050",7849,"court records from what's been said during questioning based on them,","The Trial"
"36051",7849,"especially for the accused who is in a difficult situation and is faced","The Trial"
"36052",7849,"with every possible worry to distract him. This is when the defence","The Trial"
"36053",7849,"begins. Counsel for the defence are not normally allowed to be present","The Trial"
"36054",7849,"while the accused is being questioned, so afterwards, and if possible","The Trial"
"36055",7849,"still at the door of the interview room, he has to learn what he can","The Trial"
"36056",7849,"about it from him and extract whatever he can that might be of use, even","The Trial"
"36057",7849,"though what the accused has to report is often very confused. But that","The Trial"
"36058",7849,"is not the most important thing, as there's really not a lot that can be","The Trial"
"36059",7849,"learned in this way, although in this, as with anything else, a","The Trial"
"36060",7849,"competent man will learn more than another. Nonetheless, the most","The Trial"
"36061",7849,"important thing is the lawyer's personal connections, that's where the","The Trial"
"36062",7849,"real value of taking counsel lies. Now K. will most likely have already","The Trial"
"36063",7849,"learned from his own experience that, among its very lowest orders, the","The Trial"
"36064",7849,"court organisation does have its imperfections, the court is strictly","The Trial"
"36065",7849,"closed to the public, but staff who forget their duty or who take bribes","The Trial"
"36066",7849,"do, to some extent, show where the gaps are. This is where most lawyers","The Trial"
"36067",7849,"will push their way in, this is where bribes are paid and information","The Trial"
"36068",7849,"extracted, there have even, in earlier times at least, been incidents","The Trial"
"36069",7849,"where documents have been stolen. There's no denying that some","The Trial"
"36070",7849,"surprisingly favourable results have been attained for the accused in","The Trial"
"36071",7849,"this way, for a limited time, and these petty advocates then strut to","The Trial"
"36072",7849,"and fro on the basis of them and attract new clients, but for the","The Trial"
"36073",7849,"further course of the proceedings it signifies either nothing or nothing","The Trial"
"36074",7849,"good. The only things of real value are honest personal contacts,","The Trial"
"36075",7849,"contacts with higher officials, albeit higher officials of the lower","The Trial"
"36076",7849,"grades, you understand. That is the only way the progress of the trial","The Trial"
"36077",7849,"can be influenced, hardly noticeable at first, it's true, but from then","The Trial"
"36078",7849,"on it becomes more and more visible. There are, of course, not many","The Trial"
"36079",7849,"lawyers who can do this, and K. has made a very good choice in this","The Trial"
"36080",7849,"matter. There were probably no more than one or two who had as many","The Trial"
"36081",7849,"contacts as Dr. Huld, but they don't bother with the company of the","The Trial"
"36082",7849,"lawyers' room and have nothing to do with it. This means they have all","The Trial"
"36083",7849,"the less contact with the court officials. It is not at all necessary","The Trial"
"36084",7849,"for Dr. Huld to go to the court, wait in the ante-rooms for the","The Trial"
"36085",7849,"examining judges to turn up, if they turn up, and try to achieve","The Trial"
"36086",7849,"something which, according to the judges' mood is usually more apparent","The Trial"
"36087",7849,"than real and most often not even that. No, K. has seen for himself that","The Trial"
"36088",7849,"the court officials, including some who are quite high up, come forward","The Trial"
"36089",7849,"without being asked, are glad to give information which is fully open or","The Trial"
"36090",7849,"at least easy to understand, they discuss the next stages in the","The Trial"
"36091",7849,"proceedings, in fact in some cases they can be won over and are quite","The Trial"
"36092",7849,"willing to adopt the other person's point of view. However, when this","The Trial"
"36093",7849,"happens, you should never trust them too far, as however firmly they may","The Trial"
"36094",7849,"have declared this new point of view in favour of the defendant they","The Trial"
"36095",7849,"might well go straight back to their offices and write a report for the","The Trial"
"36096",7849,"court that says just the opposite, and might well be even harder on the","The Trial"
"36097",7849,"defendant than the original view, the one they insist they've been fully","The Trial"
"36098",7849,"dissuaded from. And, of course, there's no way of defending yourself","The Trial"
"36099",7849,"from this, something said in private is indeed in private and cannot","The Trial"
"36100",7849,"then be used in public, it's not something that makes it easy for the","The Trial"
"36101",7849,"defence to keep those gentlemen's favour. On the other hand, it's also","The Trial"
"36102",7849,"true that the gentlemen don't become involved with the defence&mdash;which","The Trial"
"36103",7849,"will of course be done with great expertise&mdash;just for philanthropic","The Trial"
"36104",7849,"reasons or in order to be friendly, in some respects it would be truer","The Trial"
"36105",7849,"to say that they, too, have it allocated to them. This is where the","The Trial"
"36106",7849,"disadvantages of a court structure that, right from the start,","The Trial"
"36107",7849,"stipulates that all proceedings take place in private, come into force.","The Trial"
"36108",7849,"In normal, mediocre trials its officials have contact with the public,","The Trial"
"36109",7849,"and they're very well equipped for it, but here they don't; normal","The Trial"
"36110",7849,"trials run their course all by themselves, almost, and just need a nudge","The Trial"
"36111",7849,"here and there; but when they're faced with cases that are especially","The Trial"
"36112",7849,"difficult they're as lost as they often are with ones that are very","The Trial"
"36113",7849,"simple; they're forced to spend all their time, day and night, with","The Trial"
"36114",7849,"their laws, and so they don't have the right feel for human","The Trial"
"36115",7849,"relationships, and that's a serious shortcoming in cases like this.","The Trial"
"36116",7849,"That's when they come for advice to the lawyer, with a servant behind","The Trial"
"36117",7849,"them carrying the documents which normally are kept so secret. You could","The Trial"
"36118",7849,"have seen many gentlemen at this window, gentlemen of whom you would","The Trial"
"36119",7849,"least expect it, staring out this window in despair on the street below","The Trial"
"36120",7849,"while the lawyer is at his desk studying the documents so that he can","The Trial"
"36121",7849,"give them good advice. And at times like that it's also possible to see","The Trial"
"36122",7849,"how exceptionally seriously these gentlemen take their professions and","The Trial"
"36123",7849,"how they are thrown into great confusion by difficulties which it's just","The Trial"
"36124",7849,"not in their natures to overcome. But they're not in an easy position,","The Trial"
"36125",7849,"to regard their positions as easy would be to do them an injustice. The","The Trial"
"36126",7849,"different ranks and hierarchies of the court are endless, and even","The Trial"
"36127",7849,"someone who knows his way around them cannot always tell what's going to","The Trial"
"36128",7849,"happen. But even for the junior officials, the proceedings in the","The Trial"
"36129",7849,"courtrooms are usually kept secret, so they are hardly able to see how","The Trial"
"36130",7849,"the cases they work with proceed, court affairs appear in their range of","The Trial"
"36131",7849,"vision often without their knowing where they come from and they move on","The Trial"
"36132",7849,"further without their learning where they go. So civil servants like","The Trial"
"36133",7849,"this are not able to learn the things you can learn from studying the","The Trial"
"36134",7849,"successive stages that individual trials go through, the final verdict","The Trial"
"36135",7849,"or the reasons for it. They're only allowed to deal with that part of","The Trial"
"36136",7849,"the trial which the law allocates them, and they usually know less about","The Trial"
"36137",7849,"the results of their work after it's left them than the defence does,","The Trial"
"36138",7849,"even though the defence will usually stay in contact with the accused","The Trial"
"36139",7849,"until the trial is nearly at its end, so that the court officials can","The Trial"
"36140",7849,"learn many useful things from the defence. Bearing all this in mind,","The Trial"
"36141",7849,"does it still surprise K. that the officials are irritated and often","The Trial"
"36142",7849,"express themselves about the litigants in unflattering ways&mdash;which is an","The Trial"
"36143",7849,"experience shared by everyone. All the officials are irritated, even","The Trial"
"36144",7849,"when they appear calm. This causes many difficulties for the junior","The Trial"
"36145",7849,"advocates, of course. There is a story, for instance, that has very much","The Trial"
"36146",7849,"the ring of truth about it. It goes like this: One of the older","The Trial"
"36147",7849,"officials, a good and peaceful man, was dealing with a difficult matter","The Trial"
"36148",7849,"for the court which had become very confused, especially thanks to the","The Trial"
"36149",7849,"contributions from the lawyers. He had been studying it for a day and a","The Trial"
"36150",7849,"night without a break&mdash;as these officials are indeed hard working,","The Trial"
"36151",7849,"no-one works as hard as they do. When it was nearly morning, and he had","The Trial"
"36152",7849,"been working for twenty-four hours with probably very little result, he","The Trial"
"36153",7849,"went to the front entrance, waited there in ambush, and every time a","The Trial"
"36154",7849,"lawyer tried to enter the building he would throw him down the steps.","The Trial"
"36155",7849,"The lawyers gathered together down in front of the steps and discussed","The Trial"
"36156",7849,"with each other what they should do; on the one hand they had actually","The Trial"
"36157",7849,"no right to be allowed into the building so that there was hardly","The Trial"
"36158",7849,"anything that they could legally do to the official and, as I've already","The Trial"
"36159",7849,"mentioned, they would have to be careful not to set all the officials","The Trial"
"36160",7849,"against them. On the other hand, any day not spent in court is a day","The Trial"
"36161",7849,"lost for them and it was a matter of some importance to force their way","The Trial"
"36162",7849,"inside. In the end, they agreed that they would try to tire the old man","The Trial"
"36163",7849,"out. One lawyer after another was sent out to run up the steps and let","The Trial"
"36164",7849,"himself be thrown down again, offering what resistance he could as long","The Trial"
"36165",7849,"as it was passive resistance, and his colleagues would catch him at the","The Trial"
"36166",7849,"bottom of the steps. That went on for about an hour until the old","The Trial"
"36167",7849,"gentleman, who was already exhausted from working all night, was very","The Trial"
"36168",7849,"tired and went back to his office. Those who were at the bottom of the","The Trial"
"36169",7849,"steps could not believe it at first, so they sent somebody out to go and","The Trial"
"36170",7849,"look behind the door to see if there really was no-one there, and only","The Trial"
"36171",7849,"then did they all gather together and probably didn't even dare to","The Trial"
"36172",7849,"complain, as it's far from being the lawyers' job to introduce any","The Trial"
"36173",7849,"improvements in the court system, or even to want to. Even the most","The Trial"
"36174",7849,"junior lawyer can understand the relationship there to some extent, but","The Trial"
"36175",7849,"one significant point is that almost every defendant, even very simple","The Trial"
"36176",7849,"people, begins to think of suggestions for improving the court as soon","The Trial"
"36177",7849,"as his proceedings have begun, many of them often even spend time and","The Trial"
"36178",7849,"energy on the matter that could be spent far better elsewhere. The only","The Trial"
"36179",7849,"right thing to do is to learn how to deal with the situation as it is.","The Trial"
"36180",7849,"Even if it were possible to improve any detail of it&mdash;which is anyway no","The Trial"
"36181",7849,"more than superstitious nonsense&mdash;the best that they could achieve,","The Trial"
"36182",7849,"although doing themselves incalculable harm in the process, is that they","The Trial"
"36183",7849,"will have attracted the special attention of the officials for any case","The Trial"
"36184",7849,"that comes up in the future, and the officials are always ready to seek","The Trial"
"36185",7849,"revenge. Never attract attention to yourself! Stay calm, however much it","The Trial"
"36186",7849,"goes against your character! Try to gain some insight into the size of","The Trial"
"36187",7849,"the court organism and how, to some extent, it remains in a state of","The Trial"
"36188",7849,"suspension, and that even if you alter something in one place you'll","The Trial"
"36189",7849,"draw the ground out from under your feet and might fall, whereas if an","The Trial"
"36190",7849,"enormous organism like the court is disrupted in any one place it finds","The Trial"
"36191",7849,"it easy to provide a substitute for itself somewhere else. Everything is","The Trial"
"36192",7849,"connected with everything else and will continue without any change or","The Trial"
"36193",7849,"else, which is quite probable, even more closed, more attentive, more","The Trial"
"36194",7849,"strict, more malevolent. So it's best to leave the work to the lawyers","The Trial"
"36195",7849,"and not to keep disturbing them. It doesn't do much good to make","The Trial"
"36196",7849,"accusations, especially if you can't make it clear what they're based on","The Trial"
"36197",7849,"and their full significance, but it must be said that K. caused a great","The Trial"
"36198",7849,"deal of harm to his own case by his behaviour towards the office","The Trial"
"36199",7849,"director, he was a very influential man but now he might as well be","The Trial"
"36200",7849,"struck off the list of those who might do anything for K. If the trial","The Trial"
"36201",7849,"is mentioned, even just in passing, it's quite obvious that he's","The Trial"
"36202",7849,"ignoring it. These officials are in many ways just like children. Often,","The Trial"
"36203",7849,"something quite harmless&mdash;although K.'s behaviour could unfortunately","The Trial"
"36204",7849,"not be called harmless&mdash;will leave them feeling so offended that they","The Trial"
"36205",7849,"will even stop talking with good friends of theirs, they turn away when","The Trial"
"36206",7849,"they see them and do everything they can to oppose them. But then, with","The Trial"
"36207",7849,"no particular reason, surprisingly enough, some little joke that was","The Trial"
"36208",7849,"only ever attempted because everything seemed so hopeless will make them","The Trial"
"36209",7849,"laugh and they'll be reconciled. It's both difficult and hard at the","The Trial"
"36210",7849,"same time to deal with them, and there's hardly any reason for it. It's","The Trial"
"36211",7849,"sometimes quite astonishing that a single, average life is enough to","The Trial"
"36212",7849,"encompass so much that it's at all possible ever to have any success in","The Trial"
"36213",7849,"one's work here. On the other hand, there are also dark moments, such as","The Trial"
"36214",7849,"everyone has, when you think you've achieved nothing at all, when it","The Trial"
"36215",7849,"seems that the only trials to come to a good end are those that were","The Trial"
"36216",7849,"determined to have a good end from the start and would do so without any","The Trial"
"36217",7849,"help, while all the others are lost despite all the running to and fro,","The Trial"
"36218",7849,"all the effort, all the little, apparent successes that gave such joy.","The Trial"
"36219",7849,"Then you no longer feel very sure of anything and, if asked about a","The Trial"
"36220",7849,"trial that was doing well by its own nature but which was turned for the","The Trial"
"36221",7849,"worse because you assisted in it, would not even dare deny that. And","The Trial"
"36222",7849,"even that is a kind of self-confidence, but then it's the only one","The Trial"
"36223",7849,"that's left. Lawyers are especially vulnerable to fits of depression of","The Trial"
"36224",7849,"that sort&mdash;and they are no more than fits of depression of course&mdash;when","The Trial"
"36225",7849,"a case is suddenly taken out of their hands after they've been","The Trial"
"36226",7849,"conducting it satisfactorily for some time. That's probably the worst","The Trial"
"36227",7849,"that can happen to a lawyer. It's not that the accused takes the case","The Trial"
"36228",7849,"away from him, that hardly ever happens, once a defendant has taken on","The Trial"
"36229",7849,"a certain lawyer he has to stay with him whatever happens. How could he","The Trial"
"36230",7849,"ever carry on by himself after he's taken on help from a lawyer? No,","The Trial"
"36231",7849,"that just doesn't happen, but what does sometimes happen is that the","The Trial"
"36232",7849,"trial takes on a course where the lawyer may not go along with it.","The Trial"
"36233",7849,"Client and trial are both simply taken away from the lawyer; and then","The Trial"
"36234",7849,"even contact with the court officials won't help, however good they are,","The Trial"
"36235",7849,"as they don't know anything themselves. The trial will have entered a","The Trial"
"36236",7849,"stage where no more help can be given, where it's being processed in","The Trial"
"36237",7849,"courts to which no-one has any access, where the defendant cannot even","The Trial"
"36238",7849,"be contacted by his lawyer. You come home one day and find all the","The Trial"
"36239",7849,"documents you've submitted, which you've worked hard to create and which","The Trial"
"36240",7849,"you had the best hopes for, lying on the desk, they've been sent back as","The Trial"
"36241",7849,"they can't be carried through to the next stage in the trial, they're","The Trial"
"36242",7849,"just worthless scraps of paper. It doesn't mean that the case has been","The Trial"
"36243",7849,"lost, not at all, or at least there is no decisive reason for supposing","The Trial"
"36244",7849,"so, it's just that you don't know anything more about the case and won't","The Trial"
"36245",7849,"be told anything of what's happening. Well, cases like that are the","The Trial"
"36246",7849,"exceptions, I'm glad to say, and even if K.'s trial is one of them, it's","The Trial"
"36247",7849,"still, for the time being, a long way off. But there was still plenty of","The Trial"
"36248",7849,"opportunity for lawyers to get to work, and K. could be sure they would","The Trial"
"36249",7849,"be made use of. As he had said, the time for submitting documents was","The Trial"
"36250",7849,"still in the future and there was no rush to prepare them, it was much","The Trial"
"36251",7849,"more important to start the initial discussions with the appropriate","The Trial"
"36252",7849,"officials, and they had already taken place. With varying degrees of","The Trial"
"36253",7849,"success, it must be said. It was much better not to give away any","The Trial"
"36254",7849,"details before their time, as in that way K. could only be influenced","The Trial"
"36255",7849,"unfavourably and his hopes might be raised or he might be made too","The Trial"
"36256",7849,"anxious, better just to say that some individuals have spoken very","The Trial"
"36257",7849,"favourably and shown themselves very willing to help, although others","The Trial"
"36258",7849,"have spoken less favourably, but even they have not in any way refused","The Trial"
"36259",7849,"to help. So all in all, the results are very encouraging, only you","The Trial"
"36260",7849,"should certainly not draw any particular conclusions as all preliminary","The Trial"
"36261",7849,"proceedings begin in the same way and it was only the way they developed","The Trial"
"36262",7849,"further that would show what the value of these preliminary proceedings","The Trial"
"36263",7849,"has been. Anyway, nothing has been lost yet, and if we can succeed in","The Trial"
"36264",7849,"getting the office director, despite everything, on our side&mdash;and","The Trial"
"36265",7849,"several actions have been undertaken to this end&mdash;then everything is a","The Trial"
"36266",7849,"clean wound, as a surgeon would say, and we can wait for the results","The Trial"
"36267",7849,"with some comfort.</p>","The Trial"
"36268",7849,"","The Trial"
"36269",7849,"<p>When he started talking on in this way the lawyer was quite tireless.","The Trial"
"36270",7849,"He went through it all again every time K. went to see him. There was","The Trial"
"36271",7849,"always some progress, but he could never be told what sort of progress","The Trial"
"36272",7849,"it was. The first set of documents to be submitted were being worked on","The Trial"
"36273",7849,"but still not ready, which usually turned out to be a great advantage","The Trial"
"36274",7849,"the next time K. went to see him as the earlier occasion would have","The Trial"
"36275",7849,"been a very bad time to put them in, which they could not then have","The Trial"
"36276",7849,"known. If K., stupefied from all this talking, ever pointed out that","The Trial"
"36277",7849,"even considering all these difficulties progress was very slow, the","The Trial"
"36278",7849,"lawyer would object that progress was not slow at all, but that they","The Trial"
"36279",7849,"might have progressed far further if K. had come to him at the right","The Trial"
"36280",7849,"time. But he had come to him late and that lateness would bring still","The Trial"
"36281",7849,"further difficulties, and not only where time was concerned. The only","The Trial"
"36282",7849,"welcome interruption during these visits was always when Leni contrived","The Trial"
"36283",7849,"to bring the lawyer his tea while K. was there. Then she would stand","The Trial"
"36284",7849,"behind K.&mdash;pretending to watch the lawyer as he bent greedily over his","The Trial"
"36285",7849,"cup, poured the tea in and drank&mdash;and secretly let K. hold her hand.","The Trial"
"36286",7849,"There was always complete silence. The lawyer drank. K. squeezed Leni's","The Trial"
"36287",7849,"hand and Leni would sometimes dare to gently stroke K.'s hair. ""Still","The Trial"
"36288",7849,"here, are you?"" the lawyer would ask when he was ready. ""I wanted to","The Trial"
"36289",7849,"take the dishes away,"" said Leni, they would give each other's hands a","The Trial"
"36290",7849,"final squeeze, the lawyer would wipe his mouth and then start talking at","The Trial"
"36291",7849,"K. again with renewed energy.</p>","The Trial"
"36292",7849,"","The Trial"
"36293",7849,"<p>Was the lawyer trying to comfort K. or to confuse him? K. could not","The Trial"
"36294",7849,"tell, but it seemed clear to him that his defence was not in good","The Trial"
"36295",7849,"hands. Maybe everything the lawyer said was quite right, even though he","The Trial"
"36296",7849,"obviously wanted to make himself as conspicuous as possible and","The Trial"
"36297",7849,"probably had never even taken on a case as important as he said K.'s","The Trial"
"36298",7849,"was. But it was still suspicious how he continually mentioned his","The Trial"
"36299",7849,"personal contacts with the civil servants. Were they to be exploited","The Trial"
"36300",7849,"solely for K.'s benefit. The lawyer never forgot to mention that they","The Trial"
"36301",7849,"were dealing only with junior officials, which meant officials who were","The Trial"
"36302",7849,"dependent on others, and the direction taken in each trial could be","The Trial"
"36303",7849,"important for their own furtherment. Could it be that they were making","The Trial"
"36304",7849,"use of the lawyer to turn trials in a certain direction, which would,","The Trial"
"36305",7849,"of course, always be at the cost of the defendant. It certainly did not","The Trial"
"36306",7849,"mean that they would do that in every trial, that was not likely at all,","The Trial"
"36307",7849,"and there were probably also trials where they gave the lawyer","The Trial"
"36308",7849,"advantages and all the room he needed to turn it in the direction he","The Trial"
"36309",7849,"wanted, as it would also be to their advantage to keep his reputation","The Trial"
"36310",7849,"intact. If that really was their relationship, how would they direct","The Trial"
"36311",7849,"K.'s trial which, as the lawyer had explained, was especially difficult","The Trial"
"36312",7849,"and therefore important enough to attract great attention from the very","The Trial"
"36313",7849,"first time it came to court? There could not be much doubt about what","The Trial"
"36314",7849,"they would do. The first signs of it could already be seen in the fact","The Trial"
"36315",7849,"that the first documents still had not been submitted even though the","The Trial"
"36316",7849,"trial had already lasted several months, and that, according to the","The Trial"
"36317",7849,"lawyer, everything was still in its initial stages, which was very","The Trial"
"36318",7849,"effective, of course, in making the defendant passive and keeping him","The Trial"
"36319",7849,"helpless. Then he could be suddenly surprised with the verdict, or at","The Trial"
"36320",7849,"least with a notification that the hearing had not decided in his favour","The Trial"
"36321",7849,"and the matter would be passed on to a higher office.</p>","The Trial"
"36322",7849,"","The Trial"
"36323",7849,"<p>It was essential that K. take a hand in it himself. On winter's","The Trial"
"36324",7849,"mornings such as this, when he was very tired and everything dragged","The Trial"
"36325",7849,"itself lethargically through his head, this belief of his seemed","The Trial"
"36326",7849,"irrefutable. He no longer felt the contempt for the trial that he had","The Trial"
"36327",7849,"had earlier. If he had been alone in the world it would have been easy","The Trial"
"36328",7849,"for him to ignore it, although it was also certain that, in that case,","The Trial"
"36329",7849,"the trial would never have arisen in the first place. But now, his uncle","The Trial"
"36330",7849,"had already dragged him to see the lawyer, he had to take account of his","The Trial"
"36331",7849,"family; his job was no longer totally separate from the progress of the","The Trial"
"36332",7849,"trial, he himself had carelessly&mdash;with a certain, inexplicable","The Trial"
"36333",7849,"complacency&mdash;mentioned it to acquaintances and others had learned about","The Trial"
"36334",7849,"it in ways he did not know, his relationship with Miss Bürstner seemed","The Trial"
"36335",7849,"to be in trouble because of it. In short, he no longer had any choice","The Trial"
"36336",7849,"whether he would accept the trial or turn it down, he was in the middle","The Trial"
"36337",7849,"of it and had to defend himself. If he was tired, then that was bad.</p>","The Trial"
"36338",7849,"","The Trial"
"36339",7849,"<p>But there was no reason to worry too much before he needed to. He had","The Trial"
"36340",7849,"been capable of working himself up to his high position in the bank in","The Trial"
"36341",7849,"a relatively short time and to retain it with respect from everyone,","The Trial"
"36342",7849,"now he simply had to apply some of the talents that had made that","The Trial"
"36343",7849,"possible for him to the trial, and there was no doubt that it had to","The Trial"
"36344",7849,"turn out well. The most important thing, if something was to be","The Trial"
"36345",7849,"achieved, was to reject in advance any idea that he might be in any way","The Trial"
"36346",7849,"guilty. There was no guilt. The trial was nothing but a big piece of","The Trial"
"36347",7849,"business, just like he had already concluded to the benefit of the bank","The Trial"
"36348",7849,"many times, a piece of business that concealed many lurking dangers","The Trial"
"36349",7849,"waiting in ambush for him, as they usually did, and these dangers would","The Trial"
"36350",7849,"need to be defended against. If that was to be achieved then he must not","The Trial"
"36351",7849,"entertain any idea of guilt, whatever he did, he would need to look","The Trial"
"36352",7849,"after his own interests as closely as he could. Seen in this way, there","The Trial"
"36353",7849,"was no choice but to take his representation away from the lawyer very","The Trial"
"36354",7849,"soon, at best that very evening. The lawyer had told him, as he talked","The Trial"
"36355",7849,"to him, that that was something unheard of and would probably do him a","The Trial"
"36356",7849,"great deal of harm, but K. could not tolerate any impediment to his","The Trial"
"36357",7849,"efforts where his trial was concerned, and these impediments were","The Trial"
"36358",7849,"probably caused by the lawyer himself. But once he had shaken off the","The Trial"
"36359",7849,"lawyer the documents would need to be submitted straight away and, if","The Trial"
"36360",7849,"possible, he would need to see to it that they were being dealt with","The Trial"
"36361",7849,"every day. It would of course not be enough, if that was to be done, for","The Trial"
"36362",7849,"K. to sit in the corridor with his hat under the bench like the others.","The Trial"
"36363",7849,"Day after day, he himself, or one of the women or somebody else on his","The Trial"
"36364",7849,"behalf, would have to run after the officials and force them to sit at","The Trial"
"36365",7849,"their desks and study K.'s documents instead of looking out on the","The Trial"
"36366",7849,"corridor through the grating. There could be no let-up in these efforts,","The Trial"
"36367",7849,"everything would need to be organised and supervised, it was about time","The Trial"
"36368",7849,"that the court came up against a defendant who knew how to defend and","The Trial"
"36369",7849,"make use of his rights.</p>","The Trial"
"36370",7849,"","The Trial"
"36371",7849,"<p>But when K. had the confidence to try and do all this the difficulty of","The Trial"
"36372",7849,"composing the documents was too much for him. Earlier, just a week or","The Trial"
"36373",7849,"so before, he could only have felt shame at the thought of being made","The Trial"
"36374",7849,"to write out such documents himself; it had never entered his head that","The Trial"
"36375",7849,"the task could also be difficult. He remembered one morning when,","The Trial"
"36376",7849,"already piled up with work, he suddenly shoved everything to one side","The Trial"
"36377",7849,"and took a pad of paper on which he sketched out some of his thoughts on","The Trial"
"36378",7849,"how documents of this sort should proceed. Perhaps he would offer them","The Trial"
"36379",7849,"to that slow-witted lawyer, but just then the door of the manager's","The Trial"
"36380",7849,"office opened and the deputy director entered the room with a loud","The Trial"
"36381",7849,"laugh. K. was very embarrassed, although the deputy director, of","The Trial"
"36382",7849,"course, was not laughing at K.'s documents, which he knew nothing about,","The Trial"
"36383",7849,"but at a joke he had just heard about the stock-exchange, a joke which","The Trial"
"36384",7849,"needed an illustration if it was to be understood, and now the","The Trial"
"36385",7849,"deputy director leant over K.'s desk, took his pencil from his hand,","The Trial"
"36386",7849,"and drew the illustration on the writing pad that K. had intended for","The Trial"
"36387",7849,"his ideas about his case.</p>","The Trial"
"36388",7849,"","The Trial"
"36389",7849,"<p>K. now had no more thoughts of shame, the documents had to be prepared","The Trial"
"36390",7849,"and submitted. If, as was very likely, he could find no time to do it","The Trial"
"36391",7849,"in the office he would have to do it at home at night. If the nights","The Trial"
"36392",7849,"weren't enough he would have to take a holiday. Above all, he could not","The Trial"
"36393",7849,"stop half way, that was nonsense not only in business but always and","The Trial"
"36394",7849,"everywhere. Needless to say, the documents would mean an almost endless","The Trial"
"36395",7849,"amount of work. It was easy to come to the belief, not only for those","The Trial"
"36396",7849,"of an anxious disposition, that it was impossible ever to finish it.","The Trial"
"36397",7849,"This was not because of laziness or deceit, which were the only things","The Trial"
"36398",7849,"that might have hindered the lawyer in preparing it, but because he did","The Trial"
"36399",7849,"not know what the charge was or even what consequences it might bring,","The Trial"
"36400",7849,"so that he had to remember every tiny action and event from the whole","The Trial"
"36401",7849,"of his life, looking at them from all sides and checking and","The Trial"
"36402",7849,"reconsidering them. It was also a very disheartening job. It would have","The Trial"
"36403",7849,"been more suitable as a way of passing the long days after he had","The Trial"
"36404",7849,"retired and become senile. But now, just when K. needed to apply all his","The Trial"
"36405",7849,"thoughts to his work, when he was still rising and already posed a","The Trial"
"36406",7849,"threat to the deputy director, when every hour passed so quickly and he","The Trial"
"36407",7849,"wanted to enjoy the brief evenings and nights as a young man, this was","The Trial"
"36408",7849,"the time he had to start working out these documents. Once more, he","The Trial"
"36409",7849,"began to feel resentment. Almost involuntarily, only to put an end to","The Trial"
"36410",7849,"it, his finger felt for the button of the electric bell in the","The Trial"
"36411",7849,"ante-room. As he pressed it he glanced up to the clock. It was eleven","The Trial"
"36412",7849,"o'clock, two hours, he had spent a great deal of his costly time just","The Trial"
"36413",7849,"dreaming and his wits were, of course, even more dulled than they had","The Trial"
"36414",7849,"been before. But the time had, nonetheless, not been wasted, he had come","The Trial"
"36415",7849,"to some decisions that could be of value. As well as various pieces of","The Trial"
"36416",7849,"mail, the servitors brought two visiting cards from gentlemen who had","The Trial"
"36417",7849,"already been waiting for K. for some time. They were actually very","The Trial"
"36418",7849,"important clients of the bank who should not really have been kept","The Trial"
"36419",7849,"waiting under any circumstances. Why had they come at such an awkward","The Trial"
"36420",7849,"time, and why, the gentlemen on the other side of the closed door seemed","The Trial"
"36421",7849,"to be asking, was the industrious K. using up the best business time for","The Trial"
"36422",7849,"his private affairs? Tired from what had gone before, and tired in","The Trial"
"36423",7849,"anticipation of what was to follow, K. stood up to receive the first of","The Trial"
"36424",7849,"them.</p>","The Trial"
"36425",7849,"","The Trial"
"36426",7849,"<p>He was a short, jolly man, a manufacturer who K. knew well. He","The Trial"
"36427",7849,"apologised for disturbing K. at some important work, and K., for his","The Trial"
"36428",7849,"part, apologised for having kept the manufacturer waiting for so long.","The Trial"
"36429",7849,"But even this apology was spoken in such a mechanical way and with such","The Trial"
"36430",7849,"false intonation that the manufacturer would certainly have noticed if","The Trial"
"36431",7849,"he had not been fully preoccupied with his business affairs. Instead,","The Trial"
"36432",7849,"he hurriedly pulled calculations and tables out from all his pockets,","The Trial"
"36433",7849,"spread them out in front of K., explained several items, corrected a","The Trial"
"36434",7849,"little mistake in the arithmetic that he noticed as he quickly glanced","The Trial"
"36435",7849,"over it all, and reminded K. of a similar piece of business he'd","The Trial"
"36436",7849,"concluded with him about a year before, mentioning in passing that this","The Trial"
"36437",7849,"time there was another bank spending great effort to get his business,","The Trial"
"36438",7849,"and finally stopped speaking in order to learn K.'s opinion on the","The Trial"
"36439",7849,"matter. And K. had indeed, at first, been closely following what the","The Trial"
"36440",7849,"manufacturer was saying, he too was aware of how important the deal","The Trial"
"36441",7849,"was, but unfortunately it did not last, he soon stopped listening,","The Trial"
"36442",7849,"nodded at each of the manufacturer's louder exclamations for a short","The Trial"
"36443",7849,"while, but eventually he stopped doing even that and did no more than","The Trial"
"36444",7849,"stare at the bald head bent over the papers, asking himself when the","The Trial"
"36445",7849,"manufacturer would finally realise that everything he was saying was","The Trial"
"36446",7849,"useless. When he did stop talking, K. really thought at first that this","The Trial"
"36447",7849,"was so that he would have the chance to confess that he was incapable of","The Trial"
"36448",7849,"listening. Instead, seeing the anticipation on the manufacturer's face,","The Trial"
"36449",7849,"obviously ready to counter any objections made, he was sorry to realise","The Trial"
"36450",7849,"that the business discussion had to be continued. So he bent his head as","The Trial"
"36451",7849,"if he'd been given an order and began slowly to move his pencil over the","The Trial"
"36452",7849,"papers, now and then he would stop and stare at one of the figures. The","The Trial"
"36453",7849,"manufacturer thought there must be some objection, perhaps his figures","The Trial"
"36454",7849,"weren't really sound, perhaps they weren't the decisive issue, whatever","The Trial"
"36455",7849,"he thought, the manufacturer covered the papers with his hand and began","The Trial"
"36456",7849,"once again, moving very close to K., to explain what the deal was all","The Trial"
"36457",7849,"about. ""It is difficult,"" said K., pursing his lips. The only thing","The Trial"
"36458",7849,"that could offer him any guidance were the papers, and the manufacturer","The Trial"
"36459",7849,"had covered them from his view, so he just sank back against the arm of","The Trial"
"36460",7849,"the chair. Even when the door of the manager's office opened and","The Trial"
"36461",7849,"revealed not very clearly, as if through a veil, the deputy director, he","The Trial"
"36462",7849,"did no more than look up weakly. K. thought no more about the matter, he","The Trial"
"36463",7849,"merely watched the immediate effect of the deputy director's appearance","The Trial"
"36464",7849,"and, for him, the effect was very pleasing; the manufacturer","The Trial"
"36465",7849,"immediately jumped up from his seat and hurried over to meet the deputy","The Trial"
"36466",7849,"director, although K. would have liked to make him ten times livelier as","The Trial"
"36467",7849,"he feared the deputy director might disappear again. He need not have","The Trial"
"36468",7849,"worried, the two gentlemen met each other, shook each other's hand and","The Trial"
"36469",7849,"went together over to K.'s desk. The manufacturer said he was sorry to","The Trial"
"36470",7849,"find the chief clerk so little inclined to do business, pointing to K.","The Trial"
"36471",7849,"who, under the view of the deputy director, had bent back down over the","The Trial"
"36472",7849,"papers. As the two men leant over the desk and the manufacturer made","The Trial"
"36473",7849,"some effort to gain and keep the deputy director's attention, K. felt as","The Trial"
"36474",7849,"if they were much bigger than they really were and that their","The Trial"
"36475",7849,"negotiations were about him. Carefully and slowly turning his eyes","The Trial"
"36476",7849,"upwards, he tried to learn what was taking place above him, took one of","The Trial"
"36477",7849,"the papers from his desk without looking to see what it was, lay it on","The Trial"
"36478",7849,"the flat of his hand and raised it slowly up as he rose up to the level","The Trial"
"36479",7849,"of the two men himself. He had no particular plan in mind as he did","The Trial"
"36480",7849,"this, but merely felt this was how he would act if only he had finished","The Trial"
"36481",7849,"preparing that great document that was to remove his burden entirely.","The Trial"
"36482",7849,"The deputy director had been paying all his attention to the","The Trial"
"36483",7849,"conversation and did no more than glance at the paper, he did not read","The Trial"

"36485",7849,"was not important for him, he took it from K.'s hand saying, ""Thank you,","The Trial"
"36486",7849,"I'm already familiar with everything,"" and laid it calmly back on the","The Trial"
"36487",7849,"desk. K. gave him a bitter, sideways look. But the deputy director did","The Trial"
"36488",7849,"not notice this at all, or if he did notice it it only raised his","The Trial"
"36489",7849,"spirits, he frequently laughed out loud, one time he clearly embarrassed","The Trial"
"36490",7849,"the manufacturer when he raised an objection in a witty way but drew him","The Trial"
"36491",7849,"immediately back out of his embarrassment by commenting adversely on","The Trial"
"36492",7849,"himself, and finally invited him into his office where they could bring","The Trial"
"36493",7849,"the matter to its conclusion. ""It's a very important matter,"" said the","The Trial"

"36498",7849,"over-burdened today, there are even some people in the room outside","The Trial"
"36499",7849,"who've been waiting there for hours for him."" K. still had enough","The Trial"
"36500",7849,"control of himself to turn away from the deputy director and direct his","The Trial"
"36501",7849,"friendly, albeit stiff, smile only at the manufacturer, he made no other","The Trial"
"36502",7849,"retaliation, bent down slightly and supported himself with both hands on","The Trial"
"36503",7849,"his desk like a clerk, and watched as the two gentlemen, still talking,","The Trial"
"36504",7849,"took the papers from his desk and disappeared into the manager's office.","The Trial"
"36505",7849,"In the doorway, the manufacturer turned and said he wouldn't make his","The Trial"
"36506",7849,"farewell with K. just yet, he would of course let the chief clerk know","The Trial"
"36507",7849,"about the success of his discussions but he also had a little something","The Trial"

"36509",7849,"","The Trial"
"36510",7849,"<p>At last, K. was by himself. It did not enter his head to show anyone","The Trial"
"36511",7849,"else into his office and only became vaguely aware of how nice it was","The Trial"
"36512",7849,"that the people outside thought he was still negotiating with the","The Trial"
"36513",7849,"manufacturer and, for this reason, he could not let anyone in to see","The Trial"
"36514",7849,"him, not even the servitor. He went over to the window, sat down on the","The Trial"
"36515",7849,"ledge beside it, held firmly on to the handle and looked down onto the","The Trial"
"36516",7849,"square outside. The snow was still falling, the weather still had not","The Trial"
"36517",7849,"brightened up at all.</p>","The Trial"
"36518",7849,"","The Trial"
"36519",7849,"<p>He remained a long time sitting in this way, not knowing what it","The Trial"
"36520",7849,"actually was that made him so anxious, only occasionally did he glance,","The Trial"
"36521",7849,"slightly startled, over his shoulder at the door to the outer room","The Trial"
"36522",7849,"where, mistakenly, he thought he'd heard some noise. No-one came, and","The Trial"
"36523",7849,"that made him feel calmer, he went over to the wash stand, rinsed his","The Trial"
"36524",7849,"face with cold water and, his head somewhat clearer, went back to his","The Trial"
"36525",7849,"place by the window. The decision to take his defence into his own","The Trial"
"36526",7849,"hands now seemed more of a burden than he had originally assumed. All","The Trial"
"36527",7849,"the while he had left his defence up to the lawyer his trial had had","The Trial"
"36528",7849,"little basic affect on him, he had observed it from afar as something","The Trial"
"36529",7849,"that was scarcely able to reach him directly, when it suited him he","The Trial"
"36530",7849,"looked to see how things stood but he was also able to draw his head","The Trial"
"36531",7849,"back again whenever he wanted. Now, in contrast, if he was to conduct","The Trial"
"36532",7849,"his defence himself, he would have to devote himself entirely to the","The Trial"
"36533",7849,"court&mdash;for the time being, at least&mdash;success would mean, later on, his","The Trial"
"36534",7849,"complete and conclusive liberation, but if he was to achieve this he","The Trial"
"36535",7849,"would have to place himself, to start with, in far greater danger than","The Trial"
"36536",7849,"he had been in so far. If he ever felt tempted to doubt this, then his","The Trial"
"36537",7849,"experience with the deputy director and the manufacturer that day would","The Trial"
"36538",7849,"be quite enough to convince him of it. How could he have sat there","The Trial"
"36539",7849,"totally convinced of the need to do his own defence? How would it be","The Trial"
"36540",7849,"later? What would his life be like in the days ahead? Would he find the","The Trial"
"36541",7849,"way through it all to a happy conclusion? Did a carefully worked out","The Trial"

"36543",7849,"worked out defence not also mean he would need to shut himself off from","The Trial"
"36544",7849,"everything else as much as he could? Would he survive that? And how was","The Trial"
"36545",7849,"he to succeed in conducting all this at the bank? It involved much more","The Trial"
"36546",7849,"than just submitting some documents that he could probably prepare in a","The Trial"
"36547",7849,"few days' leave, although it would have been great temerity to ask for","The Trial"
"36548",7849,"time off from the bank just at that time, it was a whole trial and there","The Trial"
"36549",7849,"was no way of seeing how long it might last. This was an enormous","The Trial"
"36550",7849,"difficulty that had suddenly been thrown into K.'s life!</p>","The Trial"
"36551",7849,"","The Trial"
"36552",7849,"<p>And was he supposed to be doing the bank's work at a time like this? He","The Trial"
"36553",7849,"looked down at his desk. Was he supposed to let people in to see him","The Trial"
"36554",7849,"and go into negotiations with them at a time like this? While his trial","The Trial"
"36555",7849,"trundled on, while the court officials upstairs in the attic room sat","The Trial"
"36556",7849,"looking at the papers for this trial, should he be worrying about the","The Trial"
"36557",7849,"business of the bank? Did this not seem like a kind of torture,","The Trial"
"36558",7849,"acknowledged by the court, connected with the trial and which followed","The Trial"
"36559",7849,"him around? And is it likely that anyone in the bank, when judging his","The Trial"
"36560",7849,"work, would take any account of his peculiar situation? No-one and","The Trial"
"36561",7849,"never. There were those who knew about his trial, although it was not","The Trial"
"36562",7849,"quite clear who knew about it or how much. But he hoped rumours had not","The Trial"
"36563",7849,"reached as far as the deputy director, otherwise he would obviously","The Trial"
"36564",7849,"soon find a way of making use of it to harm K., he would show neither","The Trial"
"36565",7849,"comradeship nor humaneness. And what about the director? It was true","The Trial"
"36566",7849,"that he was well disposed towards K., and as soon as he heard about the","The Trial"
"36567",7849,"trial he would probably try to do everything he could to make it easier","The Trial"
"36568",7849,"for him, but he would certainly not devote himself to it. K. at one","The Trial"
"36569",7849,"time had provided the counter-balance to what the deputy director said","The Trial"
"36570",7849,"but the director was now coming more and more under his influence, and","The Trial"
"36571",7849,"the deputy director would also exploit the weakened condition of the","The Trial"
"36572",7849,"director to strengthen his own power. So what could K. hope for? Maybe","The Trial"
"36573",7849,"considerations of this sort weakened his power of resistance, but it","The Trial"
"36574",7849,"was still necessary not to deceive oneself and to see everything as","The Trial"
"36575",7849,"clearly as it could be seen at that moment.</p>","The Trial"
"36576",7849,"","The Trial"
"36577",7849,"<p>For no particular reason, just to avoiding returning to his desk for a","The Trial"
"36578",7849,"while, he opened the window. It was difficult to open and he had to","The Trial"
"36579",7849,"turn the handle with both his hands. Then, through the whole height and","The Trial"
"36580",7849,"breadth of the window, the mixture of fog and smoke was drawn into the","The Trial"
"36581",7849,"room, filling it with a slight smell of burning. A few flakes of snow","The Trial"
"36582",7849,"were blown in with it. ""It's a horrible autumn,"" said the manufacturer,","The Trial"
"36583",7849,"who had come into the room unnoticed after seeing the deputy director","The Trial"
"36584",7849,"and now stood behind K. K. nodded and looked uneasily at the","The Trial"
"36585",7849,"manufacturer's briefcase, from which he would now probably take the","The Trial"
"36586",7849,"papers and inform K. of the result of his negotiations with the deputy","The Trial"
"36587",7849,"director. However, the manufacturer saw where K. was looking, knocked","The Trial"
"36588",7849,"on his briefcase and without opening it said, ""You'll be wanting to","The Trial"
"36589",7849,"hear how things turned out. I've already got the contract in my pocket,","The Trial"
"36590",7849,"almost. He's a charming man, your deputy director&mdash;he's got his","The Trial"
"36591",7849,"dangers, though."" He laughed as he shook K.'s hand and wanted to make","The Trial"
"36592",7849,"him laugh with him. But to K., it once more seemed suspicious that the","The Trial"
"36593",7849,"manufacturer did not want to show him the papers and saw nothing about","The Trial"
"36594",7849,"his comments to laugh at. ""Chief clerk,"" said the manufacturer, ""I","The Trial"
"36595",7849,"expect the weather's been affecting your mood, has it? You're looking","The Trial"
"36596",7849,"so worried today."" ""Yes,"" said K., raising his hand and holding the","The Trial"
"36597",7849,"temple of his head, ""headaches, worries in the family."" ""Quite right,""","The Trial"
"36598",7849,"said the manufacturer, who was always in a hurry and could never listen","The Trial"
"36599",7849,"to anyone for very long, ""everyone has his cross to bear."" K. had","The Trial"
"36600",7849,"unconsciously made a step towards the door as if wanting to show the","The Trial"
"36601",7849,"manufacturer out, but the manufacturer said, ""Chief clerk, there's","The Trial"
"36602",7849,"something else I'd like to mention to you. I'm very sorry if it's","The Trial"
"36603",7849,"something that'll be a burden to you today of all days but I've been to","The Trial"
"36604",7849,"see you twice already, lately, and each time I forgot all about it. If I","The Trial"
"36605",7849,"delay it any longer it might well lose its point altogether. That would","The Trial"
"36606",7849,"be a pity, as I think what I've got to say does have some value."" Before","The Trial"
"36607",7849,"K. had had the time to answer, the manufacturer came up close to him,","The Trial"
"36608",7849,"tapped his knuckle lightly on his chest and said quietly, ""You've got a","The Trial"
"36609",7849,"trial going on, haven't you?"" K. stepped back and immediately exclaimed,","The Trial"
"36610",7849,"""That's what the deputy director's been telling you!"" ""No, no,"" said","The Trial"
"36611",7849,"the manufacturer, ""how would the deputy director know about it?"" ""And","The Trial"
"36612",7849,"what about you?"" asked K., already more in control of himself. ""I hear","The Trial"
"36613",7849,"things about the court here and there,"" said the manufacturer, ""and that","The Trial"
"36614",7849,"even applies to what it is that I wanted to tell you about."" ""There are","The Trial"
"36615",7849,"so many people who have connections with the court!"" said K. with","The Trial"
"36616",7849,"lowered head, and he led the manufacturer over to his desk. They sat","The Trial"
"36617",7849,"down where they had been before, and the manufacturer said, ""I'm afraid","The Trial"
"36618",7849,"it's not very much that I've got to tell you about. Only, in matters","The Trial"
"36619",7849,"like this, it's best not to overlook the tiniest details. Besides, I","The Trial"
"36620",7849,"really want to help you in some way, however modest my help might be.","The Trial"
"36621",7849,"We've been good business partners up till now, haven't we? Well then.""","The Trial"
"36622",7849,"K. wanted to apologise for his behaviour in the conversation earlier","The Trial"
"36623",7849,"that day, but the manufacturer would tolerate no interruption, shoved","The Trial"
"36624",7849,"his briefcase up high in his armpit to show that he was in a hurry, and","The Trial"
"36625",7849,"carried on. ""I know about your case through a certain Titorelli. He's a","The Trial"
"36626",7849,"painter, Titorelli's just his artistic name, I don't even know what his","The Trial"
"36627",7849,"real name is. He's been coming to me in my office for years from time to","The Trial"
"36628",7849,"time, and brings little pictures with him which I buy more or less just","The Trial"
"36629",7849,"for the sake of charity as he's hardly more than a beggar. And they're","The Trial"
"36630",7849,"nice pictures, too, moorland landscapes and that sort of thing. We'd","The Trial"
"36631",7849,"both got used to doing business in this way and it always went smoothly.","The Trial"
"36632",7849,"Only, one time these visits became a bit too frequent, I began to tell","The Trial"
"36633",7849,"him off for it, we started talking and I became interested how it was","The Trial"
"36634",7849,"that he could earn a living just by painting, and then I learned to my","The Trial"
"36635",7849,"amazement that his main source of income was painting portraits. 'I work","The Trial"
"36636",7849,"for the court,' he said, 'what court?' said I. And that's when he told","The Trial"
"36637",7849,"me about the court. I'm sure you can imagine how amazed I was at being","The Trial"
"36638",7849,"told all this. Ever since then I learn something new about the court","The Trial"
"36639",7849,"every time he comes to visit, and so little by little I get to","The Trial"
"36640",7849,"understand something of how it works. Anyway, Titorelli talks a lot and","The Trial"
"36641",7849,"I often have to push him away, not only because he's bound to be lying","The Trial"
"36642",7849,"but also, most of all, because a businessman like me who's already close","The Trial"
"36643",7849,"to breaking point under the weight of his own business worries can't pay","The Trial"
"36644",7849,"too much attention to other people's. But all that's just by the by.","The Trial"
"36645",7849,"Perhaps&mdash;this is what I've been thinking&mdash;perhaps Titorelli might be","The Trial"
"36646",7849,"able to help you in some small way, he knows lots of judges and even if","The Trial"
"36647",7849,"he can't have much influence himself he can give you some advice about","The Trial"
"36648",7849,"how to get some influential people on your side. And even if this","The Trial"
"36649",7849,"advice doesn't turn out to make all the difference I still think it'll","The Trial"
"36650",7849,"be very important once you've got it. You're nearly a lawyer yourself.","The Trial"
"36651",7849,"That's what I always say, Mr. K. the chief clerk is nearly a lawyer. Oh","The Trial"
"36652",7849,"I'm sure this trial of yours will turn out all right. So do you want to","The Trial"
"36653",7849,"go and see Titorelli, then. If I ask him to he'll certainly do","The Trial"
"36654",7849,"everything he possibly can. I really do think you ought to go. It","The Trial"
"36655",7849,"needn't be today, of course, just some time, when you get the chance.","The Trial"
"36656",7849,"And anyway&mdash;I want to tell you this too&mdash;you don't actually have to go","The Trial"
"36657",7849,"and see Titorelli, this advice from me doesn't place you under any","The Trial"
"36658",7849,"obligation at all. No, if you think you can get by without Titorelli","The Trial"
"36659",7849,"it'll certainly be better to leave him completely out of it. Maybe","The Trial"
"36660",7849,"you've already got a clear idea of what you're doing and Titorelli could","The Trial"
"36661",7849,"upset your plans. No, if that's the case then of course you shouldn't go","The Trial"
"36662",7849,"there under any circumstances! And it certainly won't be easy to take","The Trial"
"36663",7849,"advice from a lad like that. Still, it's up to you. Here's the letter of","The Trial"
"36664",7849,"recommendation and here's the address.""</p>","The Trial"
"36665",7849,"","The Trial"
"36666",7849,"<p>Disappointed, K. took the letter and put it in his pocket. Even at","The Trial"
"36667",7849,"best, the advantage he might derive from this recommendation was","The Trial"
"36668",7849,"incomparably smaller than the damage that lay in the fact of the","The Trial"
"36669",7849,"manufacturer knowing about his trial, and that the painter was spreading","The Trial"
"36670",7849,"the news about. It was all he could manage to give the manufacturer, who","The Trial"
"36671",7849,"was already on his way to the door, a few words of thanks. ""I'll go","The Trial"
"36672",7849,"there,"" he said as he took his leave of the manufacturer at the door,","The Trial"
"36673",7849,"""or, as I'm very busy at present, I'll write to him, perhaps he would","The Trial"
"36674",7849,"like to come to me in my office some time."" ""I was sure you'd find the","The Trial"
"36675",7849,"best solution,"" said the manufacturer. ""Although I had thought you'd","The Trial"
"36676",7849,"prefer to avoid inviting people like this Titorelli to the bank and","The Trial"
"36677",7849,"talking about the trial here. And it's not always a good idea to send","The Trial"
"36678",7849,"letters to people like Titorelli, you don't know what might happen to","The Trial"
"36679",7849,"them. But you're bound to have thought everything through and you know","The Trial"
"36680",7849,"what you can and can't do."" K. nodded and accompanied the manufacturer","The Trial"
"36681",7849,"on through the ante-room. But despite seeming calm on the outside he was","The Trial"
"36682",7849,"actually very shocked; he had told the manufacturer he would write to","The Trial"
"36683",7849,"Titorelli only to show him in some way that he valued his","The Trial"
"36684",7849,"recommendations and would consider the opportunity to speak with","The Trial"
"36685",7849,"Titorelli without delay, but if he had thought Titorelli could offer any","The Trial"
"36686",7849,"worthwhile assistance he would not have delayed. But it was only the","The Trial"
"36687",7849,"manufacturer's comment that made K. realise what dangers that could lead","The Trial"
"36688",7849,"to. Was he really able to rely on his own understanding so little? If it","The Trial"
"36689",7849,"was possible that he might invite a questionable character into the bank","The Trial"
"36690",7849,"with a clear letter, and ask advice from him about his trial, separated","The Trial"
"36691",7849,"from the deputy director by no more than a door, was it not possible or","The Trial"
"36692",7849,"even very likely that there were also other dangers he had failed to see","The Trial"
"36693",7849,"or that he was even running towards? There was not always someone","The Trial"
"36694",7849,"beside him to warn him. And just now, just when he would have to act","The Trial"
"36695",7849,"with all the strength he could muster, now a number of doubts of a sort","The Trial"
"36696",7849,"he had never before known had presented themselves and affected his own","The Trial"
"36697",7849,"vigilance! The difficulties he had been feeling in carrying out his","The Trial"
"36698",7849,"office work; were they now going to affect the trial too? Now, at least,","The Trial"
"36699",7849,"he found himself quite unable to understand how he could have intended","The Trial"
"36700",7849,"to write to Titorelli and invite him into the bank.</p>","The Trial"
"36701",7849,"","The Trial"
"36702",7849,"<p>He shook his head at the thought of it once more as the servitor came","The Trial"
"36703",7849,"up beside him and drew his attention to the three gentlemen who were","The Trial"
"36704",7849,"waiting on a bench in the ante-room. They had already been waiting to","The Trial"
"36705",7849,"see K. for a long time. Now that the servitor was speaking with K. they","The Trial"
"36706",7849,"had stood up and each of them wanted to make use of the opportunity to","The Trial"
"36707",7849,"see K. before the others. It had been negligent of the bank to let them","The Trial"
"36708",7849,"waste their time here in the waiting room, but none of them wanted to","The Trial"
"36709",7849,"draw attention to this. ""Mr. K., ..."" one of them was saying, but K.","The Trial"
"36710",7849,"had told the servitor to fetch his winter coat and said to the three of","The Trial"
"36711",7849,"them, as the servitor helped him to put it on, ""Please forgive me,","The Trial"
"36712",7849,"gentlemen, I'm afraid I have no time to see you at present. Please do","The Trial"
"36713",7849,"forgive me but I have some urgent business to settle and have to leave","The Trial"
"36714",7849,"straight away. You've already seen yourselves how long I've been","The Trial"
"36715",7849,"delayed. Would you be so kind as to come back tomorrow or some time? Or","The Trial"
"36716",7849,"perhaps we could settle your affairs by telephone. Or perhaps you would","The Trial"
"36717",7849,"like to tell me now, briefly, what it's about and I can then give you a","The Trial"
"36718",7849,"full answer in writing. Whatever, the best thing will be for you to","The Trial"
"36719",7849,"come here again."" The gentlemen now saw that their wait had been","The Trial"
"36720",7849,"totally pointless, and these suggestions of K.'s left them so astounded","The Trial"
"36721",7849,"that they looked at each other without a word. ""That's agreed then, is","The Trial"
"36722",7849,"it?"" asked K., who had turned toward the servitor bringing him his hat.","The Trial"
"36723",7849,"Through the open door of K.'s office they could see that the snowfall","The Trial"
"36724",7849,"outside had become much heavier. So K. turned the collar of his coat up","The Trial"
"36725",7849,"and buttoned it up high under his chin. Just then the deputy director","The Trial"
"36726",7849,"came out of the adjoining room, smiled as he saw K. negotiating with","The Trial"
"36727",7849,"the gentlemen in his winter coat, and asked, ""Are you about to go out?""","The Trial"
"36728",7849,"""Yes,"" said K., standing more upright, ""I have to go out on some","The Trial"
"36729",7849,"business."" But the deputy director had already turned towards the","The Trial"
"36730",7849,"gentlemen. ""And what about these gentlemen?"" he asked. ""I think they've","The Trial"
"36731",7849,"already been waiting quite a long time."" ""We've already come to an","The Trial"
"36732",7849,"understanding,"" said K. But now the gentlemen could be held back no","The Trial"
"36733",7849,"longer, they surrounded K. and explained that they would not have been","The Trial"
"36734",7849,"waiting for hours if it had not been about something important that had","The Trial"
"36735",7849,"to be discussed now, at length and in private. The deputy director","The Trial"
"36736",7849,"listened to them for a short while, he also looked at K. as he held his","The Trial"
"36737",7849,"hat in his hand cleaning the dust off it here and there, and then he","The Trial"
"36738",7849,"said, ""Gentlemen, there is a very simple way to solve this. If you","The Trial"
"36739",7849,"would prefer it, I'll be very glad to take over these negotiations","The Trial"
"36740",7849,"instead of the chief clerk. Your business does, of course, need to be","The Trial"
"36741",7849,"discussed without delay. We are businessmen like yourselves and know the","The Trial"
"36742",7849,"value of a businessman's time. Would you like to come this way?"" And he","The Trial"
"36743",7849,"opened the door leading to the ante-room of his own office.</p>","The Trial"
"36744",7849,"","The Trial"
"36745",7849,"<p>The deputy director seemed very good at appropriating everything that","The Trial"
"36746",7849,"K. was now forced to give up! But was K. not giving up more than he","The Trial"
"36747",7849,"absolutely had to? By running off to some unknown painter, with, as he","The Trial"
"36748",7849,"had to admit, very little hope of any vague benefit, his renown was","The Trial"
"36749",7849,"suffering damage that could not be repaired. It would probably be much","The Trial"
"36750",7849,"better to take off his winter coat again and, at the very least, try to","The Trial"
"36751",7849,"win back the two gentlemen who were certainly still waiting in the next","The Trial"
"36752",7849,"room. If K. had not then glimpsed the deputy director in his office,","The Trial"
"36753",7849,"looking for something from his bookshelves as if they were his own, he","The Trial"
"36754",7849,"would probably even have made the attempt. As K., somewhat agitated,","The Trial"
"36755",7849,"approached the door the deputy director called out, ""Oh, you've still","The Trial"
"36756",7849,"not left!"" He turned his face toward him&mdash;its many deep folds seemed to","The Trial"
"36757",7849,"show strength rather than age&mdash;and immediately began once more to","The Trial"
"36758",7849,"search. ""I'm looking for a copy of a contract,"" he said, ""which this","The Trial"
"36759",7849,"gentleman insists you must have. Could you help me look for it, do you","The Trial"
"36760",7849,"think?"" K. made a step forward, but the deputy director said, ""thank","The Trial"
"36761",7849,"you, I've already found it,"" and with a big package of papers, which","The Trial"
"36762",7849,"certainly must have included many more documents than just the copy of","The Trial"
"36763",7849,"the contract, he turned and went back into his own office.</p>","The Trial"
"36764",7849,"","The Trial"
"36765",7849,"<p>""I can't deal with him right now,"" K. said to himself, ""but once my","The Trial"
"36766",7849,"personal difficulties have been settled, then he'll certainly be the","The Trial"
"36767",7849,"first to get the effect of it, and he certainly won't like it.""","The Trial"
"36768",7849,"Slightly calmed by these thoughts, K. gave the servitor, who had already","The Trial"
"36769",7849,"long been holding the door to the corridor open for him, the task of","The Trial"
"36770",7849,"telling the director, when he was able, that K. was going out of the","The Trial"
"36771",7849,"bank on a business matter. As he left the bank he felt almost happy at","The Trial"
"36772",7849,"the thought of being able to devote more of himself to his own business","The Trial"
"36773",7849,"for a while.</p>","The Trial"
"36774",7849,"","The Trial"
"36775",7849,"<p>He went straight to the painter, who lived in an outlying part of town","The Trial"
"36776",7849,"which was very near to the court offices, although this area was even","The Trial"
"36777",7849,"poorer, the houses were darker, the streets were full of dirt that","The Trial"
"36778",7849,"slowly blew about over the half-melted snow. In the great gateway to","The Trial"
"36779",7849,"the building where the painter lived only one of the two doors was open,","The Trial"
"36780",7849,"a hole had been broken open in the wall by the other door, and as K.","The Trial"
"36781",7849,"approached it a repulsive, yellow, steaming liquid shot out causing","The Trial"
"36782",7849,"some rats to scurry away into the nearby canal. Down by the staircase","The Trial"
"36783",7849,"there was a small child lying on its belly crying, but it could hardly","The Trial"
"36784",7849,"be heard because of the noise from a metal-workshop on the other side","The Trial"
"36785",7849,"of the entrance hall, drowning out any other sound. The door to the","The Trial"
"36786",7849,"workshop was open, three workers stood in a circle around some piece of","The Trial"
"36787",7849,"work that they were beating with hammers. A large tin plate hung on the","The Trial"
"36788",7849,"wall, casting a pale light that pushed its way in between two of the","The Trial"
"36789",7849,"workers, lighting up their faces and their work-aprons. K. did no more","The Trial"
"36790",7849,"than glance at any of these things, he wanted to get things over with","The Trial"
"36791",7849,"here as soon as possible, to exchange just a few words to find out how","The Trial"
"36792",7849,"things stood with the painter and go straight back to the bank. Even if","The Trial"
"36793",7849,"he had just some tiny success here it would still have a good effect on","The Trial"
"36794",7849,"his work at the bank for that day. On the third floor he had to slow","The Trial"
"36795",7849,"down his pace, he was quite out of breath&mdash;the steps, just like the","The Trial"
"36796",7849,"height of each floor, were much higher than they needed to be and he'd","The Trial"
"36797",7849,"been told that the painter lived right up in the attic. The air was","The Trial"
"36798",7849,"also quite oppressive, there was no proper stairwell and the narrow","The Trial"
"36799",7849,"steps were closed in by walls on both sides with no more than a small,","The Trial"
"36800",7849,"high window here and there. Just as K. paused for a while some young","The Trial"
"36801",7849,"girls ran out of one of the flats and rushed higher up the stairs,","The Trial"
"36802",7849,"laughing. K. followed them slowly, caught up with one of the girls who","The Trial"
"36803",7849,"had stumbled and been left behind by the others, and asked her as they","The Trial"
"36804",7849,"went up side by side, ""Is there a painter, Titorelli, who lives here?""","The Trial"
"36805",7849,"The girl, hardly thirteen years old and somewhat hunchbacked, jabbed","The Trial"
"36806",7849,"him with her elbow and looked at him sideways. Her youth and her bodily","The Trial"
"36807",7849,"defects had done nothing to stop her being already quite depraved. She","The Trial"
"36808",7849,"did not smile once, but looked at K. earnestly, with sharp, acquisitive","The Trial"
"36809",7849,"eyes. K. pretended not to notice her behaviour and asked, ""Do you know","The Trial"
"36810",7849,"Titorelli, the painter?"" She nodded and asked in reply, ""What d'you","The Trial"
"36811",7849,"want to see him for?"" K. thought it would be to his advantage quickly to","The Trial"
"36812",7849,"find out something more about Titorelli. ""I want to have him paint my","The Trial"
"36813",7849,"portrait,"" he said. ""Paint your portrait?"" she asked, opening her mouth","The Trial"
"36814",7849,"too wide and lightly hitting K. with her hand as if he had said","The Trial"
"36815",7849,"something extraordinarily surprising or clumsy, with both hands she","The Trial"
"36816",7849,"lifted her skirt, which was already very short, and, as fast as she","The Trial"
"36817",7849,"could, she ran off after the other girls whose indistinct shouts lost","The Trial"
"36818",7849,"themselves in the heights. At the next turn of the stairs, however, K.","The Trial"
"36819",7849,"encountered all the girls once more. The hunchbacked girl had clearly","The Trial"
"36820",7849,"told them about K.'s intentions and they were waiting for him. They","The Trial"
"36821",7849,"stood on both sides of the stairs, pressing themselves against the wall","The Trial"
"36822",7849,"so that K. could get through between them, and smoothed their aprons","The Trial"
"36823",7849,"down with their hands. All their faces, even in this guard of honour,","The Trial"
"36824",7849,"showed a mixture of childishness and depravity. Up at the head of the","The Trial"
"36825",7849,"line of girls, who now, laughing, began to close in around K., was the","The Trial"
"36826",7849,"hunchback who had taken on the role of leader. It was thanks to her","The Trial"
"36827",7849,"that K. found the right direction without delay&mdash;he would have continued","The Trial"
"36828",7849,"up the stairs straight in front of him, but she showed him that to","The Trial"
"36829",7849,"reach Titorelli he would need to turn off to one side. The steps that","The Trial"
"36830",7849,"led up to the painter were especially narrow, very long without any","The Trial"
"36831",7849,"turning, the whole length could be seen in one glance and, at the top,","The Trial"
"36832",7849,"at Titorelli's closed door, it came to its end. This door was much","The Trial"
"36833",7849,"better illuminated than the rest of the stairway by the light from a","The Trial"
"36834",7849,"small skylight set obliquely above it, it had been put together from","The Trial"
"36835",7849,"unpainted planks of wood and the name 'Titorelli' was painted on it in","The Trial"
"36836",7849,"broad, red brushstrokes. K. was no more than half way up the steps,","The Trial"
"36837",7849,"accompanied by his retinue of girls, when, clearly the result of the","The Trial"
"36838",7849,"noise of all those footsteps, the door opened slightly and in the crack","The Trial"
"36839",7849,"a man who seemed to be dressed in just his nightshirt appeared. ""Oh!"" he","The Trial"
"36840",7849,"cried, when he saw the approaching crowd, and vanished. The hunchbacked","The Trial"
"36841",7849,"girl clapped her hands in glee and the other girls crowded in behind K.","The Trial"
"36842",7849,"to push him faster forward.</p>","The Trial"
"36843",7849,"","The Trial"
"36844",7849,"<p>They still had not arrived at the top, however, when the painter up","The Trial"
"36845",7849,"above them suddenly pulled the door wide open and, with a deep bow,","The Trial"
"36846",7849,"invited K. to enter. The girls, on the other hand, he tried to keep","The Trial"
"36847",7849,"away, he did not want to let any of them in however much they begged","The Trial"
"36848",7849,"him and however much they tried to get in&mdash;if they could not get in with","The Trial"
"36849",7849,"his permission they would try to force their way in against his will.","The Trial"
"36850",7849,"The only one to succeed was the hunchback when she slipped through under","The Trial"
"36851",7849,"his outstretched arm, but the painter chased after her, grabbed her by","The Trial"
"36852",7849,"the skirt, span her once round and set her down again by the door with","The Trial"
"36853",7849,"the other girls who, unlike the first, had not dared to cross the","The Trial"
"36854",7849,"doorstep while the painter had left his post. K. did not know what he","The Trial"
"36855",7849,"was to make of all this, as they all seemed to be having fun. One behind","The Trial"
"36856",7849,"the other, the girls by the door stretched their necks up high and","The Trial"
"36857",7849,"called out various words to the painter which were meant in jest but","The Trial"
"36858",7849,"which K. did not understand, and even the painter laughed as the","The Trial"
"36859",7849,"hunchback whirled round in his hand. Then he shut the door, bowed once","The Trial"
"36860",7849,"more to K., offered him his hand and introduced himself, saying,","The Trial"
"36861",7849,"""Titorelli, painter."" K. pointed to the door, behind which the girls","The Trial"
"36862",7849,"were whispering, and said, ""You seem to be very popular in this","The Trial"
"36863",7849,"building."" ""Ach, those brats!"" said the painter, trying in vain to","The Trial"
"36864",7849,"fasten his nightshirt at the neck. He was also bare-footed and, apart","The Trial"
"36865",7849,"from that, was wearing nothing more than a loose pair of yellowish linen","The Trial"
"36866",7849,"trousers held up with a belt whose free end whipped to and fro. ""Those","The Trial"
"36867",7849,"kids are a real burden for me,"" he continued. The top button of his","The Trial"
"36868",7849,"nightshirt came off and he gave up trying to fasten it, fetched a chair","The Trial"
"36869",7849,"for K. and made him sit down on it. ""I painted one of them once&mdash;she's","The Trial"
"36870",7849,"not here today&mdash;and ever since then they've been following me about. If","The Trial"
"36871",7849,"I'm here they only come in when I allow it, but as soon as I've gone out","The Trial"
"36872",7849,"there's always at least one of them in here. They had a key made to my","The Trial"
"36873",7849,"door and lend it round to each other. It's hard to imagine what a pain","The Trial"
"36874",7849,"that is. Suppose I come back home with a lady I'm going to paint, I open","The Trial"
"36875",7849,"the door with my own key and find the hunchback there or something, by","The Trial"
"36876",7849,"the table painting her lips red with my paintbrush, and meanwhile her","The Trial"
"36877",7849,"little sisters will be keeping guard for her, moving about and causing","The Trial"
"36878",7849,"chaos in every corner of the room. Or else, like happened yesterday, I","The Trial"
"36879",7849,"might come back home late in the evening&mdash;please forgive my appearance","The Trial"
"36880",7849,"and the room being in a mess, it is to do with them&mdash;so, I might come","The Trial"
"36881",7849,"home late in the evening and want to go to bed, then I feel something","The Trial"
"36882",7849,"pinching my leg, look under the bed and pull another of them out from","The Trial"
"36883",7849,"under it. I don't know why it is they bother me like this, I expect","The Trial"
"36884",7849,"you've just seen that I do nothing to encourage them to come near me.","The Trial"
"36885",7849,"And they make it hard for me to do my work too, of course. If I didn't","The Trial"
"36886",7849,"get this studio for nothing I'd have moved out a long time ago."" Just","The Trial"
"36887",7849,"then, a little voice, tender and anxious, called out from under the","The Trial"
"36888",7849,"door, ""Titorelli, can we come in now?"" ""No,"" answered the painter. ""Not","The Trial"
"36889",7849,"even just me, by myself?"" the voice asked again. ""Not even just you,""","The Trial"
"36890",7849,"said the painter, as he went to the door and locked it.</p>","The Trial"
"36891",7849,"","The Trial"
"36892",7849,"<p>Meanwhile, K. had been looking round the room, if it had not been","The Trial"
"36893",7849,"pointed out it would never have occurred to him that this wretched","The Trial"
"36894",7849,"little room could be called a studio. It was hardly long enough or","The Trial"
"36895",7849,"broad enough to make two steps. Everything, floor, walls and ceiling,","The Trial"
"36896",7849,"was made of wood, between the planks narrow gaps could be seen. Across","The Trial"
"36897",7849,"from where K. was, the bed stood against the wall under a covering of","The Trial"
"36898",7849,"many different colours. In the middle of the room a picture stood on an","The Trial"
"36899",7849,"easel, covered over with a shirt whose arms dangled down to the ground.","The Trial"
"36900",7849,"Behind K. was the window through which the fog made it impossible to","The Trial"
"36901",7849,"see further than the snow covered roof of the neighbouring building.</p>","The Trial"
"36902",7849,"","The Trial"
"36903",7849,"<p>The turning of the key in the lock reminded K. that he had not wanted","The Trial"
"36904",7849,"to stay too long. So he drew the manufacturer's letter out from his","The Trial"
"36905",7849,"pocket, held it out to the painter and said, ""I learned about you from","The Trial"
"36906",7849,"this gentleman, an acquaintance of yours, and it's on his advice that","The Trial"
"36907",7849,"I've come here."" The painter glanced through the letter and threw it","The Trial"
"36908",7849,"down onto the bed. If the manufacturer had not said very clearly that","The Trial"
"36909",7849,"Titorelli was an acquaintance of his, a poor man who was dependent on","The Trial"
"36910",7849,"his charity, then it would really have been quite possible to believe","The Trial"
"36911",7849,"that Titorelli did not know him or at least that he could not remember","The Trial"
"36912",7849,"him. This impression was augmented by the painter's asking, ""Were you","The Trial"
"36913",7849,"wanting to buy some pictures or did you want to have yourself painted?""","The Trial"
"36914",7849,"K. looked at the painter in astonishment. What did the letter actually","The Trial"
"36915",7849,"say? K. had taken it as a matter of course that the manufacturer had","The Trial"
"36916",7849,"explained to the painter in his letter that K. wanted nothing more with","The Trial"
"36917",7849,"him than to find out more about his trial. He had been far too rash in","The Trial"
"36918",7849,"coming here! But now he had to give the painter some sort of answer","The Trial"
"36919",7849,"and, glancing at the easel, said, ""Are you working on a picture","The Trial"
"36920",7849,"currently?"" ""Yes,"" said the painter, and he took the shirt hanging over","The Trial"
"36921",7849,"the easel and threw it onto the bed after the letter. ""It's a portrait.","The Trial"
"36922",7849,"Quite a good piece of work, although it's not quite finished yet."" This","The Trial"
"36923",7849,"was a convenient coincidence for K., it gave him a good opportunity to","The Trial"
"36924",7849,"talk about the court as the picture showed, very clearly, a judge.","The Trial"
"36925",7849,"What's more, it was remarkably similar to the picture in the lawyer's","The Trial"
"36926",7849,"office, although this one showed a quite different judge, a heavy man","The Trial"
"36927",7849,"with a full beard which was black and bushy and extended to the sides","The Trial"
"36928",7849,"far up the man's cheeks. The lawyer's picture was also an oil painting,","The Trial"
"36929",7849,"whereas this one had been made with pastel colours and was pale and","The Trial"
"36930",7849,"unclear. But everything else about the picture was similar, as this","The Trial"
"36931",7849,"judge, too, was holding tightly to the arm of his throne and seemed","The Trial"
"36932",7849,"ominously about to rise from it. At first K. was about to say, ""He","The Trial"
"36933",7849,"certainly is a judge,"" but he held himself back for the time being and","The Trial"
"36934",7849,"went closer to the picture as if he wanted to study it in detail. There","The Trial"
"36935",7849,"was a large figure shown in the middle of the throne's back rest which","The Trial"
"36936",7849,"K. could not understand and asked the painter about it. That'll need","The Trial"
"36937",7849,"some more work done on it, the painter told him, and taking a pastel","The Trial"
"36938",7849,"crayon from a small table he added a few strokes to the edges of the","The Trial"
"36939",7849,"figure but without making it any clearer as far as K. could make out.","The Trial"
"36940",7849,"""That's the figure of justice,"" said the painter, finally. ""Now I see,""","The Trial"
"36941",7849,"said K., ""here's the blindfold and here are the scales. But aren't those","The Trial"
"36942",7849,"wings on her heels, and isn't she moving?"" ""Yes,"" said the painter, ""I","The Trial"
"36943",7849,"had to paint it like that according to the contract. It's actually the","The Trial"
"36944",7849,"figure of justice and the goddess of victory all in one."" ""That is not a","The Trial"
"36945",7849,"good combination,"" said K. with a smile. ""Justice needs to remain","The Trial"
"36946",7849,"still, otherwise the scales will move about and it won't be possible to","The Trial"
"36947",7849,"make a just verdict."" ""I'm just doing what the client wanted,"" said the","The Trial"
"36948",7849,"painter. ""Yes, certainly,"" said K., who had not meant to criticise","The Trial"
"36949",7849,"anyone by that comment. ""You've painted the figure as it actually","The Trial"
"36950",7849,"appears on the throne."" ""No,"" said the painter, ""I've never seen that","The Trial"
"36951",7849,"figure or that throne, it's all just invention, but they told me what","The Trial"
"36952",7849,"it was I had to paint."" ""How's that?"" asked K. pretending not fully to","The Trial"
"36953",7849,"understand what the painter said. ""That is a judge sitting on the","The Trial"
"36954",7849,"judge's chair, isn't it?"" ""Yes,"" said the painter, ""but that judge","The Trial"
"36955",7849,"isn't very high up and he's never sat on any throne like that."" ""And he","The Trial"
"36956",7849,"has himself painted in such a grand pose. He's sitting there just like","The Trial"
"36957",7849,"the president of the court."" ""Yeah, gentlemen like this are very vain,""","The Trial"
"36958",7849,"said the painter. ""But they have permission from higher up to get","The Trial"
"36959",7849,"themselves painted like this. It's laid down quite strictly just what","The Trial"
"36960",7849,"sort of portrait each of them can get for himself. Only it's a pity that","The Trial"
"36961",7849,"you can't make out the details of his costume and pose in this picture,","The Trial"
"36962",7849,"pastel colours aren't really suitable for showing people like this.""","The Trial"
"36963",7849,"""Yes,"" said K., ""it does seem odd that it's in pastel colours."" ""That's","The Trial"
"36964",7849,"what the judge wanted,"" said the painter, ""it's meant to be for a","The Trial"
"36965",7849,"woman."" The sight of the picture seemed to make him feel like working,","The Trial"
"36966",7849,"he rolled up his shirtsleeves, picked up a few of the crayons, and K.","The Trial"
"36967",7849,"watched as a reddish shadow built up around the head of the judge under","The Trial"
"36968",7849,"their quivering tips and radiated out the to edges of the picture. This","The Trial"
"36969",7849,"shadow play slowly surrounded the head like a decoration or lofty","The Trial"
"36970",7849,"distinction. But around the figure of Justice, apart from some","The Trial"
"36971",7849,"coloration that was barely noticeable, it remained light, and in this","The Trial"
"36972",7849,"brightness the figure seemed to shine forward so that it now looked","The Trial"
"36973",7849,"like neither the God of Justice nor the God of Victory, it seemed now,","The Trial"
"36974",7849,"rather, to be a perfect depiction of the God of the Hunt. K. found the","The Trial"
"36975",7849,"painter's work more engrossing than he had wanted; but finally he","The Trial"
"36976",7849,"reproached himself for staying so long without having done anything","The Trial"
"36977",7849,"relevant to his own affair. ""What's the name of this judge?"" he asked","The Trial"
"36978",7849,"suddenly. ""I'm not allowed to tell you that,"" the painter answered. He","The Trial"
"36979",7849,"was bent deeply over the picture and clearly neglecting his guest who,","The Trial"
"36980",7849,"at first, he had received with such care. K. took this to be just a","The Trial"
"36981",7849,"foible of the painter's, and it irritated him as it made him lose time.","The Trial"
"36982",7849,"""I take it you must be a trustee of the court,"" he said. The painter","The Trial"
"36983",7849,"immediately put his crayons down, stood upright, rubbed his hands","The Trial"
"36984",7849,"together and looked at K. with a smile. ""Always straight out with the","The Trial"
"36985",7849,"truth,"" he said. ""You want to learn something about the court, like it","The Trial"
"36986",7849,"says in your letter of recommendation, but then you start talking about","The Trial"
"36987",7849,"my pictures to get me on your side. Still, I won't hold it against you,","The Trial"
"36988",7849,"you weren't to know that that was entirely the wrong thing to try with","The Trial"
"36989",7849,"me. Oh, please!"" he said sharply, repelling K.'s attempt to make some","The Trial"
"36990",7849,"objection. He then continued, ""And besides, you're quite right in your","The Trial"
"36991",7849,"comment that I'm a trustee of the court."" He made a pause, as if","The Trial"
"36992",7849,"wanting to give K. the time to come to terms with this fact. The girls","The Trial"
"36993",7849,"could once more be heard from behind the door. They were probably","The Trial"
"36994",7849,"pressed around the keyhole, perhaps they could even see into the room","The Trial"
"36995",7849,"through the gaps in the planks. K. forewent the opportunity to excuse","The Trial"
"36996",7849,"himself in some way as he did not wish to distract the painter from what","The Trial"
"36997",7849,"he was saying, or else perhaps he didn't want him to get too far above","The Trial"
"36998",7849,"himself and in this way make himself to some extent unattainable, so he","The Trial"
"36999",7849,"asked, ""Is that a publicly acknowledged position?"" ""No,"" was the","The Trial"
"37000",7849,"painter's curt reply, as if the question prevented him saying any more.","The Trial"
"37001",7849,"But K. wanted him to continue speaking and said, ""Well, positions like","The Trial"
"37002",7849,"that, that aren't officially acknowledged, can often have more influence","The Trial"
"37003",7849,"than those that are."" ""And that's how it is with me,"" said the painter,","The Trial"
"37004",7849,"and nodded with a frown. ""I was talking about your case with the","The Trial"
"37005",7849,"manufacturer yesterday, and he asked me if I wouldn't like to help you,","The Trial"
"37006",7849,"and I answered: 'He can come and see me if he likes,' and now I'm","The Trial"
"37007",7849,"pleased to see you here so soon. This business seems to be quite","The Trial"
"37008",7849,"important to you, and, of course, I'm not surprised at that. Would you","The Trial"
"37009",7849,"not like to take your coat off now?"" K. had intended to stay for only a","The Trial"
"37010",7849,"very short time, but the painter's invitation was nonetheless very","The Trial"
"37011",7849,"welcome. The air in the room had slowly become quite oppressive for him,","The Trial"
"37012",7849,"he had several times looked in amazement at a small, iron stove in the","The Trial"
"37013",7849,"corner that certainly could not have been lit, the heat of the room was","The Trial"
"37014",7849,"inexplicable. As he took off his winter overcoat and also unbuttoned","The Trial"
"37015",7849,"his frock coat the painter said to him in apology, ""I must have warmth.","The Trial"
"37016",7849,"And it is very cosy here, isn't it. This room's very good in that","The Trial"
"37017",7849,"respect."" K. made no reply, but it was actually not the heat that made","The Trial"
"37018",7849,"him uncomfortable but, much more, the stuffiness, the air that almost","The Trial"
"37019",7849,"made it more difficult to breathe, the room had probably not been","The Trial"
"37020",7849,"ventilated for a long time. The unpleasantness of this was made all the","The Trial"
"37021",7849,"stronger for K. when the painter invited him to sit on the bed while he","The Trial"
"37022",7849,"himself sat down on the only chair in the room in front of the easel.","The Trial"
"37023",7849,"The painter even seemed to misunderstand why K. remained at the edge of","The Trial"
"37024",7849,"the bed and urged K. to make himself comfortable, and as he hesitated","The Trial"
"37025",7849,"he went over to the bed himself and pressed K. deep down into the","The Trial"
"37026",7849,"bedclothes and pillows. Then he went back to his seat and at last he","The Trial"
"37027",7849,"asked his first objective question, which made K. forget everything","The Trial"
"37028",7849,"else. ""You're innocent, are you?"" he asked. ""Yes,"" said K. He felt a","The Trial"
"37029",7849,"simple joy at answering this question, especially as the answer was","The Trial"
"37030",7849,"given to a private individual and therefore would have no consequences.","The Trial"
"37031",7849,"Up till then no-one had asked him this question so openly. To make the","The Trial"
"37032",7849,"most of his pleasure he added, ""I am totally innocent."" ""So,"" said the","The Trial"
"37033",7849,"painter, and he lowered his head and seemed to be thinking. Suddenly he","The Trial"
"37034",7849,"raised his head again and said, ""Well if you're innocent it's all very","The Trial"
"37035",7849,"simple."" K. began to scowl, this supposed trustee of the court was","The Trial"
"37036",7849,"talking like an ignorant child. ""My being innocent does not make things","The Trial"
"37037",7849,"simple,"" said K. Despite everything, he couldn't help smiling and","The Trial"
"37038",7849,"slowly shook his head. ""There are many fine details in which the court","The Trial"
"37039",7849,"gets lost, but in the end it reaches into some place where originally","The Trial"
"37040",7849,"there was nothing and pulls enormous guilt out of it."" ""Yeah, yeah,","The Trial"
"37041",7849,"sure,"" said the painter, as if K. had been disturbing his train of","The Trial"
"37042",7849,"thought for no reason. ""But you are innocent, aren't you?"" ""Well of","The Trial"
"37043",7849,"course I am,"" said K. ""That's the main thing,"" said the painter. There","The Trial"
"37044",7849,"was no counter-argument that could influence him, but although he had","The Trial"
"37045",7849,"made up his mind it was not clear whether he was talking this way","The Trial"
"37046",7849,"because of conviction or indifference. K., then, wanted to find out and","The Trial"
"37047",7849,"said therefore, ""I'm sure you're more familiar with the court than I am,","The Trial"
"37048",7849,"I know hardly more about it than what I've heard, and that's been from","The Trial"
"37049",7849,"many very different people. But they were all agreed on one thing, and","The Trial"
"37050",7849,"that was that when ill thought-out accusations are made they are not","The Trial"
"37051",7849,"ignored, and that once the court has made an accusation it is convinced","The Trial"
"37052",7849,"of the guilt of the defendant and it's very hard to make it think","The Trial"
"37053",7849,"otherwise."" ""Very hard?"" the painter asked, throwing one hand up in the","The Trial"
"37054",7849,"air. ""It's impossible to make it think otherwise. If I painted all the","The Trial"
"37055",7849,"judges next to each other here on canvas, and you were trying to defend","The Trial"
"37056",7849,"yourself in front of it, you'd have more success with them than you'd","The Trial"
"37057",7849,"ever have with the real court."" ""Yes,"" said K. to himself, forgetting","The Trial"
"37058",7849,"that he had only gone there to investigate the painter.</p>","The Trial"
"37059",7849,"","The Trial"
"37060",7849,"<p>One of the girls behind the door started up again, and asked,","The Trial"
"37061",7849,"""Titorelli, is he going to go soon?"" ""Quiet!"" shouted the painter at","The Trial"
"37062",7849,"the door, ""Can't you see I'm talking with the gentleman?"" But this was","The Trial"
"37063",7849,"not enough to satisfy the girl and she asked, ""You going to paint his","The Trial"
"37064",7849,"picture?"" And when the painter didn't answer she added, ""Please don't","The Trial"
"37065",7849,"paint him, he's an 'orrible bloke."" There followed an incomprehensible,","The Trial"
"37066",7849,"interwoven babble of shouts and replies and calls of agreement. The","The Trial"
"37067",7849,"painter leapt over to the door, opened it very slightly&mdash;the girls'","The Trial"
"37068",7849,"clasped hands could be seen stretching through the crack as if they","The Trial"
"37069",7849,"wanted something&mdash;and said, ""If you're not quiet I'll throw you all","The Trial"
"37070",7849,"down the stairs. Sit down here on the steps and be quiet."" They probably","The Trial"
"37071",7849,"did not obey him immediately, so that he had to command, ""Down on the","The Trial"
"37072",7849,"steps!"" Only then it became quiet.</p>","The Trial"
"37073",7849,"","The Trial"
"37074",7849,"<p>""I'm sorry about that,"" said the painter as he returned to K. K. had","The Trial"
"37075",7849,"hardly turned towards the door, he had left it completely up to the","The Trial"
"37076",7849,"painter whether and how he would place him under his protection if he","The Trial"
"37077",7849,"wanted to. Even now, he made hardly any movement as the painter bent","The Trial"
"37078",7849,"over him and, whispering into his ear in order not to be heard outside,","The Trial"
"37079",7849,"said, ""These girls belong to the court as well."" ""How's that?"" asked","The Trial"
"37080",7849,"K., as he leant his head to one side and looked at the painter. But the","The Trial"
"37081",7849,"painter sat back down on his chair and, half in jest, half in","The Trial"
"37082",7849,"explanation, ""Well, everything belongs to the court."" ""That is","The Trial"
"37083",7849,"something I had never noticed until now,"" said K. curtly, this general","The Trial"
"37084",7849,"comment of the painter's made his comment about the girls far less","The Trial"
"37085",7849,"disturbing. Nonetheless, K. looked for a while at the door, behind which","The Trial"
"37086",7849,"the girls were now sitting quietly on the steps. Except, that one of","The Trial"
"37087",7849,"them had pushed a drinking straw through a crack between the planks and","The Trial"
"37088",7849,"was moving it slowly up and down. ""You still don't seem to have much","The Trial"
"37089",7849,"general idea of what the court's about,"" said the painter, who had","The Trial"
"37090",7849,"stretched his legs wide apart and was tapping loudly on the floor with","The Trial"
"37091",7849,"the tip of his foot. ""But as you're innocent you won't need it anyway.","The Trial"
"37092",7849,"I'll get you out of this by myself."" ""How do you intend to do that?""","The Trial"
"37093",7849,"asked K. ""You did say yourself not long ago that it's quite impossible","The Trial"
"37094",7849,"to go to the court with reasons and proofs."" ""Only impossible for","The Trial"
"37095",7849,"reasons and proofs you take to the court yourself,"" said the painter,","The Trial"
"37096",7849,"raising his forefinger as if K. had failed to notice a fine distinction.","The Trial"
"37097",7849,"""It goes differently if you try to do something behind the public court,","The Trial"
"37098",7849,"that's to say in the consultation rooms, in the corridors or here, for","The Trial"
"37099",7849,"instance, in my studio."" K. now began to find it far easier to believe","The Trial"
"37100",7849,"what the painter was saying, or rather it was largely in agreement with","The Trial"
"37101",7849,"what he had also been told by others. In fact it was even quite","The Trial"
"37102",7849,"promising. If it really was so easy to influence the judges through","The Trial"
"37103",7849,"personal contacts as the lawyer had said then the painter's contacts","The Trial"
"37104",7849,"with these vain judges was especially important, and at the very least","The Trial"
"37105",7849,"should not be undervalued. And the painter would fit in very well in the","The Trial"
"37106",7849,"circle of assistants that K. was slowly gathering around himself. He had","The Trial"
"37107",7849,"been noted at the bank for his talent in organising, here, where he was","The Trial"
"37108",7849,"placed entirely on his own resources, would be a good opportunity to","The Trial"
"37109",7849,"test that talent to its limits. The painter observed the effect his","The Trial"
"37110",7849,"explanation had had on K. and then, with a certain unease, said, ""Does","The Trial"
"37111",7849,"it not occur to you that the way I'm speaking is almost like a lawyer?","The Trial"
"37112",7849,"It's the incessant contact with the gentlemen of the court has that","The Trial"
"37113",7849,"influence on me. I gain a lot by it, of course, but I lose a lot,","The Trial"
"37114",7849,"artistically speaking."" ""How did you first come into contact with the","The Trial"
"37115",7849,"judges, then?"" asked K., he wanted first to gain the painter's trust","The Trial"
"37116",7849,"before he took him into his service. ""That was very easy,"" said the","The Trial"
"37117",7849,"painter, ""I inherited these contacts. My father was court painter before","The Trial"
"37118",7849,"me. It's a position that's always inherited. They can't use new people","The Trial"
"37119",7849,"for it, the rules governing how the various grades of officials are","The Trial"
"37120",7849,"painted are so many and varied, and, above all, so secret that no-one","The Trial"
"37121",7849,"outside of certain families even knows them. In the drawer there, for","The Trial"
"37122",7849,"instance, I've got my father's notes, which I don't show to anyone. But","The Trial"
"37123",7849,"you're only able to paint judges if you know what they say. Although,","The Trial"
"37124",7849,"even if I lost them no-one could ever dispute my position because of all","The Trial"
"37125",7849,"the rules I just carry round in my head. All the judges want to be","The Trial"
"37126",7849,"painted like the old, great judges were, and I'm the only one who can do","The Trial"
"37127",7849,"that."" ""You are to be envied,"" said K., thinking of his position at the","The Trial"
"37128",7849,"bank. ""Your position is quite unassailable, then?"" ""Yes, quite","The Trial"
"37129",7849,"unassailable,"" said the painter, and he raised his shoulders in pride.","The Trial"
"37130",7849,"""That's how I can even afford to help some poor man facing trial now and","The Trial"
"37131",7849,"then."" ""And how do you do that?"" asked K., as if the painter had not","The Trial"
"37132",7849,"just described him as a poor man. The painter did not let himself be","The Trial"
"37133",7849,"distracted, but said, ""In your case, for instance, as you're totally","The Trial"
"37134",7849,"innocent, this is what I'll do."" The repeated mention of K.'s innocence","The Trial"
"37135",7849,"was becoming irksome to him. It sometimes seemed to him as if the","The Trial"
"37136",7849,"painter was using these comments to make a favourable outcome to the","The Trial"
"37137",7849,"trial a precondition for his help, which of course would make the help","The Trial"
"37138",7849,"itself unnecessary. But despite these doubts K. forced himself not to","The Trial"
"37139",7849,"interrupt the painter. He did not want to do without the painter's help,","The Trial"
"37140",7849,"that was what he had decided, and this help did not seem in any way less","The Trial"
"37141",7849,"questionable than that of the lawyer. K. valued the painter's help far","The Trial"
"37142",7849,"more highly because it was offered in a way that was more harmless and","The Trial"
"37143",7849,"open.</p>","The Trial"
"37144",7849,"","The Trial"
"37145",7849,"<p>The painter had pulled his seat closer to the bed and continued in a","The Trial"
"37146",7849,"subdued voice: ""I forgot to ask you: what sort of acquittal is it you","The Trial"
"37147",7849,"want. There are three possibilities: absolute acquittal, apparent","The Trial"
"37148",7849,"acquittal and deferment. Absolute acquittal is the best, of course,","The Trial"
"37149",7849,"only there's nothing I could do to get that sort of outcome. I don't","The Trial"
"37150",7849,"think there's anyone at all who could do anything to get an absolute","The Trial"
"37151",7849,"acquittal. Probably the only thing that could do that is if the accused","The Trial"
"37152",7849,"is innocent. As you are innocent it could actually be possible and you","The Trial"
"37153",7849,"could depend on your innocence alone. In that case you won't need me or","The Trial"
"37154",7849,"any other kind of help.""</p>","The Trial"
"37155",7849,"","The Trial"
"37156",7849,"<p>At first, K. was astonished at this orderly explanation, but then, just","The Trial"
"37157",7849,"as quietly as the painter, he said, ""I think you're contradicting","The Trial"
"37158",7849,"yourself."" ""How's that?"" asked the painter patiently, leaning back with","The Trial"
"37159",7849,"a smile. This smile made K. feel as if he were examining not the words","The Trial"
"37160",7849,"of the painter but seeking out inconsistencies in the procedures of the","The Trial"
"37161",7849,"court itself. Nonetheless, he continued unabashed and said, ""You","The Trial"
"37162",7849,"remarked earlier that the court cannot be approached with reasoned","The Trial"
"37163",7849,"proofs, you later restricted this to the open court, and now you go so","The Trial"
"37164",7849,"far as to say that an innocent man needs no assistance in court. That","The Trial"
"37165",7849,"entails a contradiction. Moreover, you said earlier that the judges can","The Trial"
"37166",7849,"be influenced personally but now you insist that an absolute acquittal,","The Trial"
"37167",7849,"as you call it, can never be attained through personal influence. That","The Trial"
"37168",7849,"entails a second contradiction."" ""It's quite easy to clear up these","The Trial"
"37169",7849,"contradictions,"" said the painter. ""We're talking about two different","The Trial"
"37170",7849,"things here, there's what it says in the law and there's what I know","The Trial"
"37171",7849,"from my own experience, you shouldn't get the two confused. I've never","The Trial"
"37172",7849,"seen it in writing, but the law does, of course, say on the one hand","The Trial"
"37173",7849,"that the innocent will be set free, but on the other hand it doesn't","The Trial"
"37174",7849,"say that the judges can be influenced. But in my experience it's the","The Trial"
"37175",7849,"other way round. I don't know of any absolute acquittals but I do know","The Trial"
"37176",7849,"of many times when a judge has been influenced. It's possible, of","The Trial"
"37177",7849,"course, that there was no innocence in any of the cases I know about.","The Trial"
"37178",7849,"But is that likely? Not a single innocent defendant in so many cases?","The Trial"
"37179",7849,"When I was a boy I used to listen closely to my father when he told us","The Trial"
"37180",7849,"about court cases at home, and the judges that came to his studio talked","The Trial"
"37181",7849,"about the court, in our circles nobody talks about anything else; I","The Trial"
"37182",7849,"hardly ever got the chance to go to court myself but always made use of","The Trial"
"37183",7849,"it when I could, I've listened to countless trials at important stages","The Trial"
"37184",7849,"in their development, I've followed them closely as far as they could","The Trial"
"37185",7849,"be followed, and I have to say that I've never seen a single","The Trial"
"37186",7849,"acquittal."" ""So. Not a single acquittal,"" said K., as if talking to","The Trial"
"37187",7849,"himself and his hopes. ""That confirms the impression I already have of","The Trial"
"37188",7849,"the court. So there's no point in it from this side either. They could","The Trial"
"37189",7849,"replace the whole court with a single hangman."" ""You shouldn't","The Trial"
"37190",7849,"generalise,"" said the painter, dissatisfied, ""I've only been talking","The Trial"
"37191",7849,"about my own experience."" ""Well that's enough,"" said K., ""or have you","The Trial"
"37192",7849,"heard of any acquittals that happened earlier?"" ""They say there have","The Trial"
"37193",7849,"been some acquittals earlier,"" the painter answered, ""but it's very hard","The Trial"
"37194",7849,"to be sure about it. The courts don't make their final conclusions","The Trial"
"37195",7849,"public, not even the judges are allowed to know about them, so that all","The Trial"
"37196",7849,"we know about these earlier cases are just legends. But most of them did","The Trial"
"37197",7849,"involve absolute acquittals, you can believe that, but they can't be","The Trial"
"37198",7849,"proved. On the other hand, you shouldn't forget all about them either,","The Trial"
"37199",7849,"I'm sure there is some truth to them, and they are very beautiful, I've","The Trial"
"37200",7849,"painted a few pictures myself depicting these legends."" ""My assessment","The Trial"
"37201",7849,"will not be altered by mere legends,"" said K. ""I don't suppose it's","The Trial"
"37202",7849,"possible to cite these legends in court, is it?"" The painter laughed.","The Trial"
"37203",7849,"""No, you can't cite them in court,"" he said. ""Then there's no point in","The Trial"
"37204",7849,"talking about them,"" said K., he wanted, for the time being, to accept","The Trial"
"37205",7849,"anything the painter told him, even if he thought it unlikely or","The Trial"
"37206",7849,"contradicted what he had been told by others. He did not now have the","The Trial"
"37207",7849,"time to examine the truth of everything the painter said or even to","The Trial"
"37208",7849,"disprove it, he would have achieved as much as he could if the painter","The Trial"
"37209",7849,"would help him in any way even if his help would not be decisive. As a","The Trial"
"37210",7849,"result, he said, ""So let's pay no more attention to absolute acquittal,","The Trial"
"37211",7849,"but you mentioned two other possibilities."" ""Apparent acquittal and","The Trial"
"37212",7849,"deferment. They're the only possibilities,"" said the painter. ""But","The Trial"
"37213",7849,"before we talk about them, would you not like to take your coat off? You","The Trial"
"37214",7849,"must be hot."" ""Yes,"" said K., who until then had paid attention to","The Trial"
"37215",7849,"nothing but the painter's explanations, but now that he had had the heat","The Trial"
"37216",7849,"pointed out to him his brow began to sweat heavily. ""It's almost","The Trial"
"37217",7849,"unbearable."" The painter nodded as if he understood K.'s discomfort very","The Trial"
"37218",7849,"well. ""Could we not open the window?"" asked K. ""No,"" said the painter.","The Trial"
"37219",7849,"""It's only a fixed pane of glass, it can't be opened."" K. now realised","The Trial"
"37220",7849,"that all this time he had been hoping the painter would suddenly go over","The Trial"
"37221",7849,"to the window and pull it open. He had prepared himself even for the fog","The Trial"
"37222",7849,"that he would breathe in through his open mouth. The thought that here","The Trial"
"37223",7849,"he was entirely cut off from the air made him feel dizzy. He tapped","The Trial"
"37224",7849,"lightly on the bedspread beside him and, with a weak voice, said, ""That","The Trial"
"37225",7849,"is very inconvenient and unhealthy."" ""Oh no,"" said the painter in","The Trial"
"37226",7849,"defence of his window, ""as it can't be opened this room retains the heat","The Trial"
"37227",7849,"better than if the window were double glazed, even though it's only a","The Trial"
"37228",7849,"single pane. There's not much need to air the room as there's so much","The Trial"
"37229",7849,"ventilation through the gaps in the wood, but when I do want to I can","The Trial"
"37230",7849,"open one of my doors, or even both of them."" K. was slightly consoled","The Trial"
"37231",7849,"by this explanation and looked around to see where the second door was.","The Trial"
"37232",7849,"The painter saw him do so and said, ""It's behind you, I had to hide it","The Trial"
"37233",7849,"behind the bed."" Only then was K. able to see the little door in the","The Trial"
"37234",7849,"wall. ""It's really much too small for a studio here,"" said the painter,","The Trial"
"37235",7849,"as if he wanted to anticipate an objection K. would make. ""I had to","The Trial"
"37236",7849,"arrange things as well as I could. That's obviously a very bad place for","The Trial"
"37237",7849,"the bed, in front of the door. For instance when the judge I'm painting","The Trial"
"37238",7849,"at present comes he always comes through the door by the bed, and I've","The Trial"
"37239",7849,"even given him a key to this door so that he can wait for me here in the","The Trial"
"37240",7849,"studio when I'm not home. Although nowadays he usually comes early in","The Trial"
"37241",7849,"the morning when I'm still asleep. And of course, it always wakes me up","The Trial"
"37242",7849,"when I hear the door opened beside the bed, however fast asleep I am. If","The Trial"
"37243",7849,"you could hear the way I curse him as he climbs over my bed in the","The Trial"
"37244",7849,"morning you'd lose all respect for judges. I suppose I could take the","The Trial"
"37245",7849,"key away from him but that'd only make things worse. It only takes a","The Trial"
"37246",7849,"tiny effort to break any of the doors here off their hinges."" All the","The Trial"
"37247",7849,"time the painter was speaking, K. was considering whether he should take","The Trial"
"37248",7849,"off his coat, but he finally realised that, if he didn't do so, he would","The Trial"
"37249",7849,"be quite unable to stay here any longer, so he took off his frock coat","The Trial"
"37250",7849,"and lay it on his knee so that he could put it back on again as soon as","The Trial"
"37251",7849,"the conversation was over. He had hardly done this when one of the girls","The Trial"
"37252",7849,"called out, ""Now he's taken his coat off!"" and they could all be heard","The Trial"
"37253",7849,"pressing around the gaps in the planks to see the spectacle for","The Trial"
"37254",7849,"themselves. ""The girls think I'm going to paint your portrait,"" said the","The Trial"
"37255",7849,"painter, ""and that's why you're taking your coat off."" ""I see,"" said K.,","The Trial"
"37256",7849,"only slightly amused by this, as he felt little better than he had","The Trial"
"37257",7849,"before even though he now sat in his shirtsleeves. With some irritation","The Trial"
"37258",7849,"he asked, ""What did you say the two other possibilities were?"" He had","The Trial"
"37259",7849,"already forgotten the terms used. ""Apparent acquittal and deferment,""","The Trial"
"37260",7849,"said the painter. ""It's up to you which one you choose. You can get","The Trial"
"37261",7849,"either of them if I help you, but it'll take some effort of course, the","The Trial"
"37262",7849,"difference between them is that apparent acquittal needs concentrated","The Trial"
"37263",7849,"effort for a while and that deferment takes much less effort but it has","The Trial"
"37264",7849,"to be sustained. Now then, apparent acquittal. If that's what you want","The Trial"
"37265",7849,"I'll write down an assertion of your innocence on a piece of paper. The","The Trial"
"37266",7849,"text for an assertion of this sort was passed down to me from my father","The Trial"
"37267",7849,"and it's quite unassailable. I take this assertion round to the judges I","The Trial"
"37268",7849,"know. So I'll start off with the one I'm currently painting, and put","The Trial"
"37269",7849,"the assertion to him when he comes for his sitting this evening. I'll","The Trial"
"37270",7849,"lay the assertion in front of him, explain that you're innocent and give","The Trial"
"37271",7849,"him my personal guarantee of it. And that's not just a superficial","The Trial"
"37272",7849,"guarantee, it's a real one and it's binding."" The painter's eyes seemed","The Trial"
"37273",7849,"to show some reproach of K. for wanting to impose that sort of","The Trial"
"37274",7849,"responsibility on him. ""That would be very kind of you,"" said K. ""And","The Trial"
"37275",7849,"would the judge then believe you and nonetheless not pass an absolute","The Trial"
"37276",7849,"acquittal?"" ""It's like I just said,"" answered the painter. ""And anyway,","The Trial"
"37277",7849,"it's not entirely sure that all the judges would believe me, many of","The Trial"
"37278",7849,"them, for instance, might want me to bring you to see them personally.","The Trial"
"37279",7849,"So then you'd have to come along too. But at least then, if that","The Trial"
"37280",7849,"happens, the matter is half way won, especially as I'd teach you in","The Trial"
"37281",7849,"advance exactly how you'd need to act with the judge concerned, of","The Trial"
"37282",7849,"course. What also happens, though, is that there are some judges who'll","The Trial"
"37283",7849,"turn me down in advance, and that's worse. I'll certainly make several","The Trial"
"37284",7849,"attempts, but still, we'll have to forget about them, but at least we","The Trial"
"37285",7849,"can afford to do that as no one judge can pass the decisive verdict.","The Trial"
"37286",7849,"Then when I've got enough judges' signatures on this document I take it","The Trial"
"37287",7849,"to the judge who's concerned with your case. I might even have his","The Trial"
"37288",7849,"signature already, in which case things develop a bit quicker than they","The Trial"
"37289",7849,"would do otherwise. But there aren't usually many hold ups from then","The Trial"
"37290",7849,"on, and that's the time that the defendant can feel most confident.","The Trial"
"37291",7849,"It's odd, but true, that people feel more confidence in this time than","The Trial"
"37292",7849,"they do after they've been acquitted. There's no particular exertion","The Trial"
"37293",7849,"needed now. When he has the document asserting the defendant's","The Trial"
"37294",7849,"innocence, guaranteed by a number of other judges, the judge can acquit","The Trial"
"37295",7849,"you without any worries, and although there are still several","The Trial"
"37296",7849,"formalities to be gone through there's no doubt that that's what he'll","The Trial"
"37297",7849,"do as a favour to me and several other acquaintances. You, however, walk","The Trial"
"37298",7849,"out the court and you're free."" ""So, then I'll be free,"" said K.,","The Trial"
"37299",7849,"hesitantly. ""That's right,"" said the painter, ""but only apparently free","The Trial"
"37300",7849,"or, to put it a better way, temporarily free, as the most junior judges,","The Trial"
"37301",7849,"the ones I know, they don't have the right to give the final acquittal.","The Trial"
"37302",7849,"Only the highest judge can do that, in the court that's quite out of","The Trial"
"37303",7849,"reach for you, for me and for all of us. We don't know how things look","The Trial"
"37304",7849,"there and, incidentally, we don't want to know. The right to acquit","The Trial"
"37305",7849,"people is a major privilege and our judges don't have it, but they do","The Trial"
"37306",7849,"have the right to free people from the indictment. That's to say, if","The Trial"
"37307",7849,"they're freed in this way then for the time being the charge is","The Trial"
"37308",7849,"withdrawn but it's still hanging over their heads and it only takes an","The Trial"
"37309",7849,"order from higher up to bring it back into force. And as I'm in such","The Trial"
"37310",7849,"good contact with the court I can also tell you how the difference","The Trial"
"37311",7849,"between absolute and apparent acquittal is described, just in a","The Trial"
"37312",7849,"superficial way, in the directives to the court offices. If there's an","The Trial"
"37313",7849,"absolute acquittal all proceedings should stop, everything disappears","The Trial"
"37314",7849,"from the process, not just the indictment but the trial and even the","The Trial"
"37315",7849,"acquittal disappears, everything just disappears. With an apparent","The Trial"
"37316",7849,"acquittal it's different. When that happens, nothing has changed except","The Trial"
"37317",7849,"that the case for your innocence, for your acquittal and the grounds for","The Trial"
"37318",7849,"the acquittal have been made stronger. Apart from that, proceedings go","The Trial"
"37319",7849,"on as before, the court offices continue their business and the case","The Trial"
"37320",7849,"gets passed to higher courts, gets passed back down to the lower courts","The Trial"
"37321",7849,"and so on, backwards and forwards, sometimes faster, sometimes slower,","The Trial"
"37322",7849,"to and fro. It's impossible to know exactly what's happening while this","The Trial"
"37323",7849,"is going on. Seen from outside it can sometimes seem that everything has","The Trial"
"37324",7849,"been long since forgotten, the documents have been lost and the","The Trial"
"37325",7849,"acquittal is complete. No-one familiar with the court would believe it.","The Trial"
"37326",7849,"No documents ever get lost, the court forgets nothing. One day&mdash;no-one","The Trial"
"37327",7849,"expects it&mdash;some judge or other picks up the documents and looks more","The Trial"
"37328",7849,"closely at them, he notices that this particular case is still active,","The Trial"
"37329",7849,"and orders the defendant's immediate arrest. I've been talking here as","The Trial"
"37330",7849,"if there's a long delay between apparent acquittal and re-arrest, that","The Trial"
"37331",7849,"is quite possible and I do know of cases like that, but it's just as","The Trial"
"37332",7849,"likely that the defendant goes home after he's been acquitted and finds","The Trial"
"37333",7849,"somebody there waiting to re-arrest him. Then, of course, his life as a","The Trial"
"37334",7849,"free man is at an end."" ""And does the trial start over again?"" asked K.,","The Trial"
"37335",7849,"finding it hard to believe. ""The trial will always start over again,""","The Trial"
"37336",7849,"said the painter, ""but there is, once again as before, the possibility","The Trial"
"37337",7849,"of getting an apparent acquittal. Once again, the accused has to muster","The Trial"
"37338",7849,"all his strength and mustn't give up."" The painter said that last phrase","The Trial"
"37339",7849,"possibly as a result of the impression that K., whose shoulders had","The Trial"
"37340",7849,"dropped somewhat, gave on him. ""But to get a second acquittal,"" asked","The Trial"
"37341",7849,"K., as if in anticipation of further revelations by the painter, ""is","The Trial"
"37342",7849,"that not harder to get than the first time?"" ""As far as that's","The Trial"
"37343",7849,"concerned,"" answered the painter, ""there's nothing you can say for","The Trial"
"37344",7849,"certain. You mean, do you, that the second arrest would have an adverse","The Trial"
"37345",7849,"influence on the judge and the verdict he passes on the defendant.","The Trial"
"37346",7849,"That's not how it happens. When the acquittal is passed the judges are","The Trial"
"37347",7849,"already aware that re-arrest is likely. So when it happens it has hardly","The Trial"
"37348",7849,"any effect. But there are countless other reasons why the judges' mood","The Trial"
"37349",7849,"and their legal acumen in the case can be altered, and efforts to obtain","The Trial"
"37350",7849,"the second acquittal must therefore be suited to the new conditions, and","The Trial"
"37351",7849,"generally just as vigorous as the first."" ""But this second acquittal","The Trial"
"37352",7849,"will once again not be final,"" said K., shaking his head. ""Of course","The Trial"
"37353",7849,"not,"" said the painter, ""the second acquittal is followed by the third","The Trial"
"37354",7849,"arrest, the third acquittal by the fourth arrest and so on. That's what","The Trial"
"37355",7849,"is meant by the term apparent acquittal."" K. was silent. ""You clearly","The Trial"
"37356",7849,"don't think an apparent acquittal offers much advantage,"" said the","The Trial"
"37357",7849,"painter, ""perhaps deferment would suit you better. Would you like me to","The Trial"
"37358",7849,"explain what deferment is about?"" K. nodded. The painter had leant back","The Trial"
"37359",7849,"and spread himself out in his chair, his nightshirt was wide open, he","The Trial"
"37360",7849,"had pushed his hand inside and was stroking his breast and his sides.","The Trial"
"37361",7849,"""Deferment,"" said the painter, looking vaguely in front of himself for a","The Trial"
"37362",7849,"while as if trying to find a perfectly appropriate explanation,","The Trial"
"37363",7849,"""deferment consists of keeping proceedings permanently in their earliest","The Trial"
"37364",7849,"stages. To do that, the accused and those helping him need to keep in","The Trial"
"37365",7849,"continuous personal contact with the court, especially those helping","The Trial"
"37366",7849,"him. I repeat, this doesn't require so much effort as getting an","The Trial"
"37367",7849,"apparent acquittal, but it probably requires a lot more attention. You","The Trial"
"37368",7849,"must never let the trial out of your sight, you have to go and see the","The Trial"
"37369",7849,"appropriate judge at regular intervals as well as when something in","The Trial"
"37370",7849,"particular comes up and, whatever you do, you have to try and remain","The Trial"
"37371",7849,"friendly with him; if you don't know the judge personally you have to","The Trial"
"37372",7849,"influence him through the judges you do know, and you have to do it","The Trial"
"37373",7849,"without giving up on the direct discussions. As long as you don't fail","The Trial"
"37374",7849,"to do any of these things you can be reasonably sure the trial won't get","The Trial"
"37375",7849,"past its first stages. The trial doesn't stop, but the defendant is","The Trial"
"37376",7849,"almost as certain of avoiding conviction as if he'd been acquitted.","The Trial"
"37377",7849,"Compared with an apparent acquittal, deferment has the advantage that","The Trial"
"37378",7849,"the defendant's future is less uncertain, he's safe from the shock of","The Trial"
"37379",7849,"being suddenly re-arrested and doesn't need to fear the exertions and","The Trial"
"37380",7849,"stress involved in getting an apparent acquittal just when everything","The Trial"
"37381",7849,"else in his life would make it most difficult. Deferment does have","The Trial"
"37382",7849,"certain disadvantages of its own though, too, and they shouldn't be","The Trial"
"37383",7849,"under-estimated. I don't mean by this that the defendant is never free,","The Trial"
"37384",7849,"he's never free in the proper sense of the word with an apparent","The Trial"
"37385",7849,"acquittal either. There's another disadvantage. Proceedings can't be","The Trial"
"37386",7849,"prevented from moving forward unless there are some at least ostensible","The Trial"
"37387",7849,"reasons given. So something needs to seem to be happening when looked at","The Trial"
"37388",7849,"from the outside. This means that from time to time various injunctions","The Trial"
"37389",7849,"have to be obeyed, the accused has to be questioned, investigations have","The Trial"
"37390",7849,"to take place and so on. The trial's been artificially constrained","The Trial"
"37391",7849,"inside a tiny circle, and it has to be continuously spun round within","The Trial"
"37392",7849,"it. And that, of course, brings with it certain unpleasantnesses for the","The Trial"
"37393",7849,"accused, although you shouldn't imagine they're all that bad. All of","The Trial"
"37394",7849,"this is just for show, the interrogations, for instance, they're only","The Trial"
"37395",7849,"very short, if you ever don't have the time or don't feel like going to","The Trial"
"37396",7849,"them you can offer an excuse, with some judges you can even arrange the","The Trial"
"37397",7849,"injunctions together a long time in advance, in essence all it means is","The Trial"
"37398",7849,"that, as the accused, you have to report to the judge from time to","The Trial"
"37399",7849,"time."" Even while the painter was speaking those last words K. had laid","The Trial"
"37400",7849,"his coat over his arm and had stood up. Immediately, from outside the","The Trial"
"37401",7849,"door, there was a cry of ""He's standing up now!"" ""Are you leaving","The Trial"
"37402",7849,"already?"" asked the painter, who had also stood up. ""It must be the air","The Trial"
"37403",7849,"that's driving you out. I'm very sorry about that. There's still a lot I","The Trial"
"37404",7849,"need to tell you. I had to put everything very briefly but I hope at","The Trial"
"37405",7849,"least it was all clear."" ""Oh yes,"" said K., whose head was aching from","The Trial"
"37406",7849,"the effort of listening. Despite this affirmation the painter summed it","The Trial"
"37407",7849,"all up once more, as if he wanted to give K. something to console him on","The Trial"
"37408",7849,"his way home. ""Both have in common that they prevent the defendant being","The Trial"
"37409",7849,"convicted,"" he said. ""But they also prevent his being properly","The Trial"
"37410",7849,"acquitted,"" said K. quietly, as if ashamed to acknowledge it. ""You've","The Trial"
"37411",7849,"got it, in essence,"" said the painter quickly. K. placed his hand on his","The Trial"
"37412",7849,"winter overcoat but could not bring himself to put it on. Most of all he","The Trial"
"37413",7849,"would have liked to pack everything together and run out to the fresh","The Trial"
"37414",7849,"air. Not even the girls could induce him to put his coat on, even though","The Trial"
"37415",7849,"they were already loudly telling each other that he was doing so. The","The Trial"
"37416",7849,"painter still had to interpret K.'s mood in some way, so he said, ""I","The Trial"
"37417",7849,"expect you've deliberately avoided deciding between my suggestions yet.","The Trial"
"37418",7849,"That's good. I would even have advised against making a decision","The Trial"
"37419",7849,"straight away. There's no more than a hair's breadth of difference","The Trial"
"37420",7849,"between the advantages and disadvantages. Everything has to be carefully","The Trial"
"37421",7849,"weighed up. But the most important thing is you shouldn't lose too much","The Trial"
"37422",7849,"time."" ""I'll come back here again soon,"" said K., who had suddenly","The Trial"
"37423",7849,"decided to put his frock coat on, threw his overcoat over his shoulder","The Trial"
"37424",7849,"and hurried over to the door behind which the girls now began to scream.","The Trial"
"37425",7849,"K. thought he could even see the screaming girls through the door.","The Trial"
"37426",7849,"""Well, you'll have to keep your word,"" said the painter, who had not","The Trial"
"37427",7849,"followed him, ""otherwise I'll come to the bank to ask about it myself.""","The Trial"
"37428",7849,"""Will you open this door for me,"" said K. pulling at the handle which,","The Trial"
"37429",7849,"as he noticed from the resistance, was being held tightly by the girls","The Trial"
"37430",7849,"on the other side. ""Do you want to be bothered by the girls?"" asked the","The Trial"
"37431",7849,"painter. ""It's better if you use the other way out,"" he said, pointing","The Trial"
"37432",7849,"to the door behind the bed. K. agreed to this and jumped back to the","The Trial"
"37433",7849,"bed. But instead of opening that door the painter crawled under the bed","The Trial"
"37434",7849,"and from underneath it asked K., ""Just a moment more, would you not like","The Trial"
"37435",7849,"to see a picture I could sell to you?"" K. did not want to be impolite,","The Trial"
"37436",7849,"the painter really had taken his side and promised to help him more in","The Trial"
"37437",7849,"the future, and because of K.'s forgetfulness there had been no mention","The Trial"
"37438",7849,"of any payment for the painter's help, so K. could not turn him down now","The Trial"
"37439",7849,"and allowed him to show him the picture, even though he was quivering","The Trial"
"37440",7849,"with impatience to get out of the studio. From under the bed, the","The Trial"
"37441",7849,"painter withdrew a pile of unframed paintings. They were so covered in","The Trial"
"37442",7849,"dust that when the painter tried to blow it off the one on top the dust","The Trial"

"37444",7849,"time. ""Moorland landscape,"" said the painter passing the picture to K.","The Trial"
"37445",7849,"It showed two sickly trees, well separated from each other in dark","The Trial"
"37446",7849,"grass. In the background there was a multi-coloured sunset. ""That's","The Trial"
"37447",7849,"nice,"" said K. ""I'll buy it."" K. expressed himself in this curt way","The Trial"
"37448",7849,"without any thought, so he was glad when the painter did not take this","The Trial"
"37449",7849,"amiss and picked up a second painting from the floor. ""This is a","The Trial"
"37450",7849,"counterpart to the first picture,"" said the painter. Perhaps it had been","The Trial"
"37451",7849,"intended as a counterpart, but there was not the slightest difference to","The Trial"
"37452",7849,"be seen between it and the first picture, there were the trees, there","The Trial"
"37453",7849,"the grass and there the sunset. But this was of little importance to K.","The Trial"
"37454",7849,"""They are beautiful landscapes,"" he said, ""I'll buy them both and hang","The Trial"
"37455",7849,"them in my office."" ""You seem to like this subject,"" said the painter,","The Trial"
"37456",7849,"picking up a third painting, ""good job I've still got another, similar","The Trial"
"37457",7849,"picture here."" The picture though, was not similar, rather it was","The Trial"
"37458",7849,"exactly the same moorland landscape. The painter was fully exploiting","The Trial"
"37459",7849,"this opportunity to sell off his old pictures. ""I'll take this one too,""","The Trial"
"37460",7849,"said K. ""How much do the three paintings cost?"" ""We can talk about that","The Trial"
"37461",7849,"next time,"" said the painter. ""You're in a hurry now, and we'll still be","The Trial"
"37462",7849,"in contact. And besides, I'm glad you like the paintings, I'll give you","The Trial"
"37463",7849,"all the paintings I've got down here. They're all moorland landscapes,","The Trial"
"37464",7849,"I've painted a lot of moorland landscapes. A lot of people don't like","The Trial"
"37465",7849,"that sort of picture because they're too gloomy, but there are others,","The Trial"
"37466",7849,"and you're one of them, who love gloomy themes."" But K. was not in the","The Trial"
"37467",7849,"mood to hear about the professional experiences of this painter cum","The Trial"
"37468",7849,"beggar. ""Wrap them all up!"" he called out, interrupting the painter as","The Trial"
"37469",7849,"he was speaking, ""my servant will come to fetch them in the morning.""","The Trial"
"37470",7849,"""There's no need for that,"" said the painter. ""I expect I can find a","The Trial"
"37471",7849,"porter for you who can go with you now."" And, at last, he leant over the","The Trial"
"37472",7849,"bed and unlocked the door. ""Just step on the bed, don't worry about","The Trial"
"37473",7849,"that,"" said the painter, ""that's what everyone does who comes in here.""","The Trial"
"37474",7849,"Even without this invitation, K. had shown no compunction in already","The Trial"
"37475",7849,"placing his foot in the middle of the bed covers, then he looked out","The Trial"
"37476",7849,"through the open door and drew his foot back again. ""What is that?"" he","The Trial"
"37477",7849,"asked the painter. ""What are you so surprised at?"" he asked, surprised","The Trial"
"37478",7849,"in his turn. ""Those are court offices. Didn't you know there are court","The Trial"
"37479",7849,"offices here. There are court offices in almost every attic, why should","The Trial"
"37480",7849,"this building be any different? Even my studio is actually one of the","The Trial"
"37481",7849,"court offices but the court put it at my disposal."" It was not so much","The Trial"
"37482",7849,"finding court offices even here that shocked K., he was mainly shocked","The Trial"
"37483",7849,"at himself, at his own naïvety in court matters. It seemed to him that","The Trial"
"37484",7849,"one of the most basic rules governing how a defendant should behave was","The Trial"
"37485",7849,"always to be prepared, never allow surprises, never to look,","The Trial"
"37486",7849,"unsuspecting, to the right when the judge stood beside him to his","The Trial"
"37487",7849,"left&mdash;and this was the very basic rule that he was continually","The Trial"
"37488",7849,"violating. A long corridor extended in front of him, air blew in from it","The Trial"
"37489",7849,"which, compared with the air in the studio, was refreshing. There were","The Trial"
"37490",7849,"benches set along each side of the corridor just as in the waiting area","The Trial"
"37491",7849,"for the office he went to himself. There seemed to be precise rules","The Trial"
"37492",7849,"governing how offices should be equipped. There did not seem to be many","The Trial"
"37493",7849,"people visiting the offices that day. There was a man there, half","The Trial"
"37494",7849,"sitting, half laying, his face was buried in his arm on the bench and he","The Trial"
"37495",7849,"seemed to be sleeping; another man was standing in the half-dark at the","The Trial"
"37496",7849,"end of the corridor. K. now climbed over the bed, the painter followed","The Trial"
"37497",7849,"him with the pictures. They soon came across a servant of the court&mdash;K.","The Trial"
"37498",7849,"was now able to recognise all the servants of the court from the gold","The Trial"
"37499",7849,"buttons they wore on their civilian clothes below the normal","The Trial"
"37500",7849,"buttons&mdash;and the painter instructed him to go with K. carrying the","The Trial"
"37501",7849,"pictures. K. staggered more than he walked, his handkerchief pressed","The Trial"
"37502",7849,"over his mouth. They had nearly reached the exit when the girls stormed","The Trial"
"37503",7849,"in on them, so K. had not been able to avoid them. They had clearly seen","The Trial"
"37504",7849,"that the second door of the studio had been opened and had gone around","The Trial"
"37505",7849,"to impose themselves on him from this side. ""I can't come with you any","The Trial"
"37506",7849,"further!"" called out the painter with a laugh as the girls pressed in.","The Trial"
"37507",7849,"""Goodbye, and don't hesitate too long!"" K. did not even look round at","The Trial"
"37508",7849,"him. Once on the street he took the first cab he came across. He now had","The Trial"
"37509",7849,"to get rid of the servant, whose gold button continually caught his eye","The Trial"
"37510",7849,"even if it caught no-one else's. As a servant, the servant of the court","The Trial"
"37511",7849,"was going to sit on the coach-box. But K. chased him down from there. It","The Trial"
"37512",7849,"was already well into the afternoon when K. arrived in front of the","The Trial"
"37513",7849,"bank. He would have liked to leave the pictures in the cab but feared","The Trial"
"37514",7849,"there might be some occasion when he would have to let the painter see","The Trial"
"37515",7849,"he still had them. So he had the pictures taken to his office and locked","The Trial"

"37591",7849,"stopped at the door of the lawyer's office, opened it and, to the","The Trial"
"37592",7849,"businessman who had obediently gone ahead, called, ""Not so fast! Bring","The Trial"
"37593",7849,"some light here!"" K. thought Leni might have hidden in here, he let the","The Trial"

"37595",7849,"the picture of the judge K. took hold of the businessman's braces to","The Trial"
"37596",7849,"stop him moving on. ""Do you know him?"" he asked, pointing upwards with","The Trial"
"37597",7849,"his finger. The businessman lifted the candle, blinked as he looked up","The Trial"
"37598",7849,"and said, ""It's a judge."" ""An important judge?"" asked K., and stood to","The Trial"
"37599",7849,"the side and in front of the businessman so that he could observe what","The Trial"
"37600",7849,"impression the picture had on him. The businessman was looking up in","The Trial"
"37601",7849,"admiration. ""He's an important judge."" ""You don't have much insight,""","The Trial"

"37613",7849,"said K., ""now take me there!"" K. had never been in the kitchen, it was","The Trial"

"37621",7849,"the businessman was to sit on, and he did indeed sit down on it. K.","The Trial"
"37622",7849,"however went very close behind Leni's back, leant over her shoulder and","The Trial"
"37623",7849,"asked, ""Who is this man?"" Leni put one hand around K. as she stirred the","The Trial"
"37624",7849,"soup with the other, she drew him forward toward herself and said, ""He's","The Trial"

"37630",7849,"nightshirt,"" said K., putting his hand on her head and turning it back","The Trial"
"37631",7849,"towards the stove. She was silent. ""Is he your lover?"" asked K. She was","The Trial"
"37632",7849,"about to take hold of the pot of soup, but K. took both her hands and","The Trial"
"37633",7849,"said, ""Answer me!"" She said, ""Come into the office, I'll explain","The Trial"
"37634",7849,"everything to you."" ""No,"" said K., ""I want you to explain it here."" She","The Trial"
"37635",7849,"put her arms around him and wanted to kiss him. K., though, pushed her","The Trial"
"37636",7849,"away and said, ""I don't want you to kiss me now."" ""Josef,"" said Leni,","The Trial"
"37637",7849,"looking at K. imploringly but frankly in the eyes, ""you're not going to","The Trial"
"37638",7849,"be jealous of Mr. Block now, are you. Rudi,"" she then said, turning to","The Trial"
"37639",7849,"the businessman, ""help me out will you, I'm being suspected of","The Trial"
"37640",7849,"something, you can see that, leave the candle alone."" It had looked as","The Trial"
"37641",7849,"though Mr. Block had not been paying attention but he had been","The Trial"
"37642",7849,"following closely. ""I don't even know why you might be jealous,"" he","The Trial"
"37643",7849,"said ingenuously. ""Nor do I, actually,"" said K., looking at the","The Trial"
"37644",7849,"businessman with a smile. Leni laughed out loud and while K. was not","The Trial"
"37645",7849,"paying attention took the opportunity of embracing him and whispering,","The Trial"
"37646",7849,"""Leave him alone, now, you can see what sort of person he is. I've been","The Trial"

"37650",7849,"want I'll tell him you're here. But you can certainly spend the night","The Trial"
"37651",7849,"with me. It's so long since you were last here, even the lawyer has been","The Trial"
"37652",7849,"asking about you. Don't neglect your case! And I've got some things to","The Trial"
"37653",7849,"tell you that I've learned about. But now, before anything else, take","The Trial"
"37654",7849,"your coat off!"" She helped him off with his coat, took the hat off his","The Trial"
"37655",7849,"head, ran with the things into the hallway to hang them up, then she ran","The Trial"
"37656",7849,"back and saw to the soup. ""Do you want me to tell him you're here","The Trial"
"37657",7849,"straight away or take him his soup first?"" ""Tell him I'm here first,""","The Trial"
"37658",7849,"said K. He was in a bad mood, he had originally intended a detailed","The Trial"
"37659",7849,"discussion of his business with Leni, especially the question of his","The Trial"
"37660",7849,"giving the lawyer notice, but now he no longer wanted to because of the","The Trial"
"37661",7849,"presence of the businessman. Now he considered his affair too important","The Trial"
"37662",7849,"to let this little businessman take part in it and perhaps change some","The Trial"
"37663",7849,"of his decisions, and so he called Leni back even though she was already","The Trial"
"37664",7849,"on her way to the lawyer. ""Bring him his soup first,"" he said, ""I want","The Trial"
"37665",7849,"him to get his strength up for the discussion with me, he'll need it.""","The Trial"
"37666",7849,"""You're a client of the lawyer's too, aren't you,"" said the businessman","The Trial"
"37667",7849,"quietly from his corner as if he were trying to find this out. It was","The Trial"
"37668",7849,"not, however, taken well. ""What business is that of yours?"" said K., and","The Trial"
"37669",7849,"Leni said, ""Will you be quiet.&mdash;I'll take him his soup first then, shall","The Trial"

"37696",7849,"""Yes,"" said the businessman, ""a very long time."" ""How many years has he","The Trial"
"37697",7849,"been representing you so far, then?"" asked K. ""I don't know how you","The Trial"
"37698",7849,"mean,"" said the businessman, ""he's been my business lawyer&mdash;I buy and","The Trial"
"37699",7849,"sell cereals&mdash;he's been my business lawyer since I took the business","The Trial"
"37700",7849,"over, and that's about twenty years now, but perhaps you mean my own","The Trial"
"37701",7849,"trial and he's been representing me in that since it started, and","The Trial"
"37702",7849,"that's been more than five years. Yes, well over five years,"" he then","The Trial"
"37703",7849,"added, pulling out an old briefcase, ""I've got everything written down;","The Trial"
"37704",7849,"I can tell you the exact dates if you like. It's so hard to remember","The Trial"
"37705",7849,"everything. Probably, my trial's been going on much longer than that,","The Trial"
"37706",7849,"it started soon after the death of my wife, and that's been more than","The Trial"
"37707",7849,"five and a half years now."" K. moved in closer to him. ""So the lawyer","The Trial"
"37708",7849,"takes on ordinary legal business, does he?"" he asked. This combination","The Trial"
"37709",7849,"of criminal and commercial business seemed surprisingly reassuring for","The Trial"
"37710",7849,"K. ""Oh yes,"" said the businessman, and then he whispered, ""They even","The Trial"
"37711",7849,"say he's more efficient in jurisprudence than he is in other matters.""","The Trial"
"37712",7849,"But then he seemed to regret saying this, and he laid a hand on K.'s","The Trial"
"37713",7849,"shoulder and said, ""Please don't betray me to him, will you."" K. patted","The Trial"
"37714",7849,"his thigh to reassure him and said, ""No, I don't betray people."" ""He","The Trial"
"37715",7849,"can be so vindictive, you see,"" said the businessman. ""I'm sure he won't","The Trial"
"37716",7849,"do anything against such a faithful client as you,"" said K. ""Oh, he","The Trial"
"37717",7849,"might do,"" said the businessman, ""when he gets cross it doesn't matter","The Trial"
"37718",7849,"who it is, and anyway, I'm not really faithful to him."" ""How's that","The Trial"
"37719",7849,"then?"" asked K. ""I'm not sure I should tell you about it,"" said the","The Trial"
"37720",7849,"businessman hesitantly. ""I think it'll be alright,"" said K. ""Well then,""","The Trial"
"37721",7849,"said the businessman, ""I'll tell you about some of it, but you'll have","The Trial"

"37725",7849,"have you been unfaithful to the lawyer?"" ""I've ..."" said the businessman","The Trial"
"37726",7849,"hesitantly, and in a tone as if he were confessing something","The Trial"
"37727",7849,"dishonourable, ""I've taken on other lawyers besides him."" ""That's not so","The Trial"
"37728",7849,"serious,"" said K., a little disappointed. ""It is, here,"" said the","The Trial"

"37730",7849,"confession but who now, after hearing K.'s comment, began to feel more","The Trial"
"37731",7849,"trust for him. ""That's not allowed. And it's allowed least of all to","The Trial"
"37732",7849,"take on petty lawyers when you've already got a proper one. And that's","The Trial"
"37733",7849,"just what I have done, besides him I've got five petty lawyers."" ""Five!""","The Trial"
"37734",7849,"exclaimed K., astonished at this number, ""Five lawyers besides this","The Trial"
"37735",7849,"one?"" The businessman nodded. ""I'm even negotiating with a sixth one.""","The Trial"
"37736",7849,"""But why do you need so many lawyers?"" asked K. ""I need all of them,""","The Trial"
"37737",7849,"said the businessman. ""Would you mind explaining that to me?"" asked K.","The Trial"
"37738",7849,"""I'd be glad to,"" said the businessman. ""Most of all, I don't want to","The Trial"
"37739",7849,"lose my case, well that's obvious. So that means I mustn't neglect","The Trial"
"37740",7849,"anything that might be of use to me; even if there's very little hope of","The Trial"
"37741",7849,"a particular thing being of any use I can't just throw it away. So","The Trial"
"37742",7849,"everything I have I've put to use in my case. I've taken all the money","The Trial"
"37743",7849,"out of my business, for example, the offices for my business used to","The Trial"
"37744",7849,"occupy nearly a whole floor, but now all I need is a little room at the","The Trial"
"37745",7849,"back where I work with one apprentice. It wasn't just using up the money","The Trial"
"37746",7849,"that caused the difficulty, of course, it was much more to do with me","The Trial"
"37747",7849,"not working at the business as much as I used to. If you want to do","The Trial"
"37748",7849,"something about your trial you don't have much time for anything else.""","The Trial"
"37749",7849,"""So you're also working at the court yourself?"" asked K. ""That's just","The Trial"
"37750",7849,"what I want to learn more about."" ""I can't tell you very much about","The Trial"
"37751",7849,"that,"" said the businessman, ""at first I tried to do that too but I soon","The Trial"
"37752",7849,"had to give it up again. It wears you out too much, and it's really not","The Trial"
"37753",7849,"much use. And it turned out to be quite impossible to work there","The Trial"
"37754",7849,"yourself and to negotiate, at least for me it was. It's a heavy strain","The Trial"
"37755",7849,"there just sitting and waiting. You know yourself what the air is like","The Trial"
"37756",7849,"in those offices."" ""How do you know I've been there, then?"" asked K. ""I","The Trial"
"37757",7849,"was in the waiting room myself when you went through."" ""What a","The Trial"
"37758",7849,"coincidence that is!"" exclaimed K., totally engrossed and forgetting how","The Trial"
"37759",7849,"ridiculous the businessman had seemed to him earlier. ""So you saw me!","The Trial"
"37760",7849,"You were in the waiting room when I went through. Yes, I did go through","The Trial"
"37761",7849,"it one time."" ""It isn't such a big coincidence,"" said the businessman,","The Trial"
"37762",7849,"""I'm there nearly every day."" ""I expect I'll have to go there quite","The Trial"
"37763",7849,"often myself now,"" said K., ""although I can hardly expect to be shown","The Trial"
"37764",7849,"the same respect as I was then. They all stood up for me. They must have","The Trial"
"37765",7849,"thought I was a judge."" ""No,"" said the businessman, ""we were greeting","The Trial"
"37766",7849,"the servant of the court. We knew you were a defendant. That sort of","The Trial"
"37767",7849,"news spreads very quickly."" ""So you already knew about that,"" said K.,","The Trial"
"37768",7849,"""the way I behaved must have seemed very arrogant to you. Did you","The Trial"
"37769",7849,"criticise me for it afterwards?"" ""No,"" said the businessman, ""quite the","The Trial"
"37770",7849,"opposite. That was just stupidity."" ""What do you mean, 'stupidity'?""","The Trial"
"37771",7849,"asked K. ""Why are you asking about it?"" said the businessman in some","The Trial"
"37772",7849,"irritation. ""You still don't seem to know the people there and you might","The Trial"
"37773",7849,"take it wrong. Don't forget in proceedings like this there are always","The Trial"
"37774",7849,"lots of different things coming up to talk about, things that you just","The Trial"
"37775",7849,"can't understand with reason alone, you just get too tired and","The Trial"
"37776",7849,"distracted for most things and so, instead, people rely on superstition.","The Trial"
"37777",7849,"I'm talking about the others, but I'm no better myself. One of these","The Trial"
"37778",7849,"superstitions, for example, is that you can learn a lot about the","The Trial"
"37779",7849,"outcome of a defendant's case by looking at his face, especially the","The Trial"
"37780",7849,"shape of his lips. There are lots who believe that, and they said they","The Trial"
"37781",7849,"could see from the shape of your lips that you'd definitely be found","The Trial"
"37782",7849,"guilty very soon. I repeat that all this is just a ridiculous","The Trial"
"37783",7849,"superstition, and in most cases it's completely disproved by the facts,","The Trial"
"37784",7849,"but when you live in that society it's hard to hold yourself back from","The Trial"
"37785",7849,"beliefs like that. Just think how much effect that superstition can","The Trial"
"37786",7849,"have. You spoke to one of them there, didn't you? He was hardly able to","The Trial"
"37787",7849,"give you an answer. There are lots of things there that can make you","The Trial"
"37788",7849,"confused, of course, but one of them, for him, was the appearance of","The Trial"
"37789",7849,"your lips. He told us all later he thought he could see something in","The Trial"
"37790",7849,"your lips that meant he'd be convicted himself."" ""On my lips?"" asked K.,","The Trial"
"37791",7849,"pulling out a pocket mirror and examining himself. ""I can see nothing","The Trial"
"37792",7849,"special about my lips. Can you?"" ""Nor can I,"" said the businessman,","The Trial"
"37793",7849,"""nothing at all."" ""These people are so superstitious!"" exclaimed K.","The Trial"
"37794",7849,"""Isn't that what I just told you?"" asked the businessman. ""Do you then","The Trial"
"37795",7849,"have that much contact with each other, exchanging each other's","The Trial"
"37796",7849,"opinions?"" said K. ""I've kept myself completely apart so far."" ""They","The Trial"
"37797",7849,"don't normally have much contact with each other,"" said the businessman,","The Trial"
"37798",7849,"""that would be impossible, there are so many of them. And they don't","The Trial"
"37799",7849,"have much in common either. If a group of them ever thinks they have","The Trial"
"37800",7849,"found something in common it soon turns out they were mistaken. There's","The Trial"
"37801",7849,"nothing you can do as a group where the court's concerned. Each case is","The Trial"
"37802",7849,"examined separately, the court is very painstaking. So there's nothing","The Trial"
"37803",7849,"to be achieved by forming into a group, only sometimes an individual","The Trial"
"37804",7849,"will achieve something in secret; and it's only when that's been done","The Trial"
"37805",7849,"the others learn about it; nobody knows how it was done. So there's no","The Trial"
"37806",7849,"sense of togetherness, you meet people now and then in the waiting","The Trial"
"37807",7849,"rooms, but we don't talk much there. The superstitious beliefs were","The Trial"
"37808",7849,"established a long time ago and they spread all by themselves."" ""I saw","The Trial"
"37809",7849,"those gentlemen in the waiting room,"" said K., ""it seemed so pointless","The Trial"
"37810",7849,"for them to be waiting in that way."" ""Waiting is not pointless,"" said","The Trial"
"37811",7849,"the businessman, ""it's only pointless if you try and interfere yourself.","The Trial"
"37812",7849,"I told you just now I've got five lawyers besides this one. You might","The Trial"
"37813",7849,"think&mdash;I thought it myself at first&mdash;you might think I could leave the","The Trial"
"37814",7849,"whole thing entirely up to them now. That would be entirely wrong. I can","The Trial"
"37815",7849,"leave it up to them less than when I had just the one. Maybe you don't","The Trial"
"37816",7849,"understand that, do you?"" ""No,"" said K., and to slow the businessman","The Trial"
"37817",7849,"down, who had been speaking too fast, he laid his hand on the","The Trial"
"37818",7849,"businessman's to reassure him, ""but I'd like just to ask you to speak a","The Trial"
"37819",7849,"little more slowly, these are many very important things for me, and I","The Trial"
"37820",7849,"can't follow exactly what you're saying."" ""You're quite right to remind","The Trial"
"37821",7849,"me of that,"" said the businessman, ""you're new to all this, a junior.","The Trial"
"37822",7849,"Your trial is six months old, isn't it. Yes, I've heard about it. Such a","The Trial"
"37823",7849,"new case! But I've already thought all these things through countless","The Trial"
"37824",7849,"times, to me they're the most obvious things in the world."" ""You must be","The Trial"
"37825",7849,"glad your trial has already progressed so far, are you?"" asked K., he","The Trial"
"37826",7849,"did not wish to ask directly how the businessman's affairs stood, but","The Trial"
"37827",7849,"received no clear answer anyway. ""Yes, I've been working at my trial for","The Trial"
"37828",7849,"five years now,"" said the businessman as his head sank, ""that's no small","The Trial"
"37829",7849,"achievement."" Then he was silent for a while. K. listened to hear","The Trial"
"37830",7849,"whether Leni was on her way back. On the one hand he did not want her to","The Trial"
"37831",7849,"come back too soon as he still had many questions to ask and did not","The Trial"
"37832",7849,"want her to find him in this intimate discussion with the businessman,","The Trial"
"37833",7849,"but on the other hand it irritated him that she stayed so long with the","The Trial"
"37834",7849,"lawyer when K. was there, much longer than she needed to give him his","The Trial"
"37835",7849,"soup. ""I still remember it exactly,"" the businessman began again, and K.","The Trial"
"37836",7849,"immediately gave him his full attention, ""when my case was as old as","The Trial"
"37837",7849,"yours is now. I only had this one lawyer at that time but I wasn't very","The Trial"
"37838",7849,"satisfied with him."" Now I'll find out everything, thought K., nodding","The Trial"
"37839",7849,"vigorously as if he could thereby encourage the businessman to say","The Trial"
"37840",7849,"everything worth knowing. ""My case,"" the businessman continued, ""didn't","The Trial"
"37841",7849,"move on at all, there were some hearings that took place and I went to","The Trial"
"37842",7849,"every one of them, collected materials, handed all my business books to","The Trial"
"37843",7849,"the court&mdash;which I later found was entirely unnecessary&mdash;I ran back and","The Trial"
"37844",7849,"forth to the lawyer, and he submitted various documents to the court","The Trial"
"37845",7849,"too...."" ""Various documents?"" asked K. ""Yes, that's right,"" said the","The Trial"
"37846",7849,"businessman. ""That's very important for me,"" said K., ""in my case he's","The Trial"
"37847",7849,"still working on the first set of documents. He still hasn't done","The Trial"
"37848",7849,"anything. I see now that he's been neglecting me quite disgracefully.""","The Trial"
"37849",7849,"""There can be lots of good reasons why the first documents still aren't","The Trial"
"37850",7849,"ready,"" said the businessman, ""and anyway, it turned out later on that","The Trial"
"37851",7849,"the ones he submitted for me were entirely worthless. I even read one of","The Trial"
"37852",7849,"them myself, one of the officials at the court was very helpful. It was","The Trial"
"37853",7849,"very learned, but it didn't actually say anything. Most of all, there","The Trial"
"37854",7849,"was lots of Latin, which I can't understand, then pages and pages of","The Trial"
"37855",7849,"general appeals to the court, then lots of flattery for particular","The Trial"
"37856",7849,"officials, they weren't named, these officials, but anyone familiar with","The Trial"
"37857",7849,"the court must have been able to guess who they were, then there was","The Trial"
"37858",7849,"self-praise by the lawyer where he humiliated himself to the court in a","The Trial"
"37859",7849,"way that was downright dog-like, and then endless investigations of","The Trial"
"37860",7849,"cases from the past which were supposed to be similar to mine. Although,","The Trial"
"37861",7849,"as far as I was able to follow them, these investigations had been","The Trial"
"37862",7849,"carried out very carefully. Now, I don't mean to criticise the lawyer's","The Trial"
"37863",7849,"work with all of this, and the document I read was only one of many, but","The Trial"
"37864",7849,"even so, and this is something I will say, at that time I couldn't see","The Trial"
"37865",7849,"any progress in my trial at all."" ""And what sort of progress had you","The Trial"
"37866",7849,"been hoping for?"" asked K. ""That's a very sensible question,"" said the","The Trial"
"37867",7849,"businessman with a smile, ""it's only very rare that you see any progress","The Trial"
"37868",7849,"in these proceedings at all. But I didn't know that then. I'm a","The Trial"
"37869",7849,"businessman, much more in those days than now, I wanted to see some","The Trial"
"37870",7849,"tangible progress, it should have all been moving to some conclusion or","The Trial"
"37871",7849,"at least should have been moving on in some way according to the rules.","The Trial"
"37872",7849,"Instead of which there were just more hearings, and most of them went","The Trial"
"37873",7849,"through the same things anyway; I had all the answers off pat like in a","The Trial"
"37874",7849,"church service; there were messengers from the court coming to me at","The Trial"
"37875",7849,"work several times a week, or they came to me at home or anywhere else","The Trial"
"37876",7849,"they could find me; and that was very disturbing of course (but at least","The Trial"
"37877",7849,"now things are better in that respect, it's much less disturbing when","The Trial"
"37878",7849,"they contact you by telephone), and rumours about my trial even started","The Trial"
"37879",7849,"to spread among some of the people I do business with, and especially my","The Trial"
"37880",7849,"relations, so I was being made to suffer in many different ways but","The Trial"
"37881",7849,"there was still not the slightest sign that even the first hearing would","The Trial"
"37882",7849,"take place soon. So I went to the lawyer and complained about it. He","The Trial"
"37883",7849,"explained it all to me at length, but refused to do anything I asked","The Trial"
"37884",7849,"for, no-one has any influence on the way the trial proceeds, he said, to","The Trial"
"37885",7849,"try and insist on it in any of the documents submitted&mdash;like I was","The Trial"
"37886",7849,"asking&mdash;was simply unheard of and would do harm to both him and me. I","The Trial"
"37887",7849,"thought to myself: What this lawyer can't or won't do another lawyer","The Trial"
"37888",7849,"will. So I looked round for other lawyers. And before you say anything:","The Trial"
"37889",7849,"none of them asked for a definite date for the main trial and none of","The Trial"
"37890",7849,"them got one, and anyway, apart from one exception which I'll talk about","The Trial"
"37891",7849,"in a minute, it really is impossible, that's one thing this lawyer","The Trial"
"37892",7849,"didn't mislead me about; but besides, I had no reason to regret turning","The Trial"
"37893",7849,"to other lawyers. Perhaps you've already heard how Dr. Huld talks about","The Trial"
"37894",7849,"the petty lawyers, he probably made them sound very contemptible to you,","The Trial"
"37895",7849,"and he's right, they are contemptible. But when he talks about them and","The Trial"
"37896",7849,"compares them with himself and his colleagues there's a small error","The Trial"
"37897",7849,"running through what he says, and, just for your interest, I'll tell you","The Trial"
"37898",7849,"about it. When he talks about the lawyers he mixes with he sets them","The Trial"
"37899",7849,"apart by calling them the 'great lawyers'. That's wrong, anyone can call","The Trial"
"37900",7849,"himself 'great' if he wants to, of course, but in this case only the","The Trial"
"37901",7849,"usage of the court can make that distinction. You see, the court says","The Trial"
"37902",7849,"that besides the petty lawyers there are also minor lawyers and great","The Trial"
"37903",7849,"lawyers. This one and his colleagues are only minor lawyers, and the","The Trial"
"37904",7849,"difference in rank between them and the great lawyers, who I've only","The Trial"
"37905",7849,"ever heard about and never seen, is incomparably greater than between","The Trial"
"37906",7849,"the minor lawyers and the despised petty lawyers."" ""The great lawyers?""","The Trial"
"37907",7849,"asked K. ""Who are they then? How do you contact them?"" ""You've never","The Trial"
"37908",7849,"heard about them, then?"" said the businessman. ""There's hardly anyone","The Trial"
"37909",7849,"who's been accused who doesn't spend a lot of time dreaming about the","The Trial"
"37910",7849,"great lawyers once he's heard about them. It's best if you don't let","The Trial"
"37911",7849,"yourself be misled in that way. I don't know who the great lawyers are,","The Trial"
"37912",7849,"and there's probably no way of contacting them. I don't know of any case","The Trial"
"37913",7849,"I can talk about with certainty where they've taken any part. They do","The Trial"
"37914",7849,"defend a lot of people, but you can't get hold of them by your own","The Trial"

"37916",7849,"suppose they ever take on cases that haven't already got past the lower","The Trial"
"37917",7849,"courts. Anyway, it's best not to think about them, as if you do it makes","The Trial"
"37918",7849,"the discussions with the other lawyers, all their advice and all that","The Trial"
"37919",7849,"they do manage to achieve, seem so unpleasant and useless, I had that","The Trial"
"37920",7849,"experience myself, just wanted to throw everything away and lay at home","The Trial"
"37921",7849,"in bed and hear nothing more about it. But that, of course, would be the","The Trial"
"37922",7849,"stupidest thing you could do, and you wouldn't be left in peace in bed","The Trial"
"37923",7849,"for very long either."" ""So you weren't thinking about the great lawyers","The Trial"
"37924",7849,"at that time?"" asked K. ""Not for very long,"" said the businessman, and","The Trial"
"37925",7849,"smiled again, ""you can't forget about them entirely, I'm afraid,","The Trial"
"37926",7849,"especially in the night when these thoughts come so easily. But I wanted","The Trial"
"37927",7849,"immediate results in those days, so I went to the petty lawyers.""</p>","The Trial"
"37928",7849,"","The Trial"
"37929",7849,"<p>""Well look at you two sat huddled together!"" called Leni as she came","The Trial"
"37930",7849,"back with the dish and stood in the doorway. They were indeed sat close","The Trial"
"37931",7849,"together, if either of them turned his head even slightly it would have","The Trial"
"37932",7849,"knocked against the other's, the businessman was not only very small","The Trial"
"37933",7849,"but also sat hunched down, so that K. was also forced to bend down low","The Trial"
"37934",7849,"if he wanted to hear everything. ""Not quite yet!"" called out K., to turn","The Trial"
"37935",7849,"Leni away, his hand, still resting on the businessman's hand, twitching","The Trial"
"37936",7849,"with impatience. ""He wanted me to tell him about my trial,"" said the","The Trial"
"37937",7849,"businessman to Leni. ""Carry on, then, carry on,"" she said. She spoke to","The Trial"
"37938",7849,"the businessman with affection but, at the same time, with","The Trial"
"37939",7849,"condescension. K. did not like that, he had begun to learn that the man","The Trial"
"37940",7849,"was of some value after all, he had experience at least, and he was","The Trial"
"37941",7849,"willing to share it. Leni was probably wrong about him. He watched her","The Trial"
"37942",7849,"in irritation as Leni now took the candle from the businessman's","The Trial"
"37943",7849,"hand&mdash;which he had been holding on to all this time&mdash;wiped his hand","The Trial"
"37944",7849,"with her apron and then knelt beside him to scratch off some wax that","The Trial"
"37945",7849,"had dripped from the candle onto his trousers. ""You were about to tell","The Trial"
"37946",7849,"me about the petty lawyers,"" said K., shoving Leni's hand away with no","The Trial"
"37947",7849,"further comment. ""What's wrong with you today?"" asked Leni, tapped him","The Trial"
"37948",7849,"gently and carried on with what she had been doing. ""Yes, the petty","The Trial"
"37949",7849,"lawyers,"" said the businessman, putting his hand to his brow as if","The Trial"
"37950",7849,"thinking hard. K. wanted to help him and said, ""You wanted immediate","The Trial"
"37951",7849,"results and so went to the petty lawyers."" ""Yes, that's right,"" said","The Trial"
"37952",7849,"the businessman, but did not continue with what he'd been saying. ""Maybe","The Trial"
"37953",7849,"he doesn't want to speak about it in front of Leni,"" thought K.,","The Trial"
"37954",7849,"suppressing his impatience to hear the rest straight away, and stopped","The Trial"
"37955",7849,"trying to press him.</p>","The Trial"
"37956",7849,"","The Trial"
"37957",7849,"<p>""Have you told him I'm here?"" he asked Leni. ""Course I have,"" she said,","The Trial"
"37958",7849,"""he's waiting for you. Leave Block alone now, you can talk to Block","The Trial"
"37959",7849,"later, he'll still be here."" K. still hesitated. ""You'll still be","The Trial"
"37960",7849,"here?"" he asked the businessman, wanting to hear the answer from him and","The Trial"
"37961",7849,"not wanting Leni to speak about the businessman as if he weren't there,","The Trial"
"37962",7849,"he was full of secret resentment towards Leni today. And once more it","The Trial"
"37963",7849,"was only Leni who answered. ""He often sleeps here."" ""He sleeps here?""","The Trial"
"37964",7849,"exclaimed K., he had thought the businessman would just wait there for","The Trial"
"37965",7849,"him while he quickly settled his business with the lawyer, and then","The Trial"
"37966",7849,"they would leave together to discuss everything thoroughly and","The Trial"
"37967",7849,"undisturbed. ""Yes,"" said Leni, ""not everyone's like you, Josef, allowed","The Trial"
"37968",7849,"to see the lawyer at any time you like. Don't even seem surprised that","The Trial"
"37969",7849,"the lawyer, despite being ill, still receives you at eleven o'clock at","The Trial"
"37970",7849,"night. You take it far too much for granted, what your friends do for","The Trial"
"37971",7849,"you. Well, your friends, or at least I do, we like to do things for you.","The Trial"
"37972",7849,"I don't want or need any more thanks than that you're fond of me."" ""Fond","The Trial"
"37973",7849,"of you?"" thought K. at first, and only then it occurred to him, ""Well,","The Trial"
"37974",7849,"yes, I am fond of her."" Nonetheless, what he said, forgetting all the","The Trial"
"37975",7849,"rest, was, ""He receives me because I am his client. If I needed anyone","The Trial"
"37976",7849,"else's help I'd have to beg and show gratitude whenever I do anything.""","The Trial"
"37977",7849,"""He's really nasty today, isn't he?"" Leni asked the businessman. ""Now","The Trial"
"37978",7849,"it's me who's not here,"" thought K., and nearly lost his temper with","The Trial"
"37979",7849,"the businessman when, with the same rudeness as Leni, he said, ""The","The Trial"
"37980",7849,"lawyer also has other reasons to receive him. His case is much more","The Trial"
"37981",7849,"interesting than mine. And it's only in its early stages too, it","The Trial"
"37982",7849,"probably hasn't progressed very far so the lawyer still likes to deal","The Trial"
"37983",7849,"with him. That'll all change later on."" ""Yeah, yeah,"" said Leni, looking","The Trial"
"37984",7849,"at the businessman and laughing. ""He doesn't half talk!"" she said,","The Trial"
"37985",7849,"turning to face K. ""You can't believe a word he says. He's as talkative","The Trial"
"37986",7849,"as he is sweet. Maybe that's why the lawyer can't stand him. At least,","The Trial"
"37987",7849,"he only sees him when he's in the right mood. I've already tried hard to","The Trial"
"37988",7849,"change that but it's impossible. Just think, there are times when I tell","The Trial"
"37989",7849,"him Block's here and he doesn't receive him until three days later. And","The Trial"
"37990",7849,"if Block isn't on the spot when he's called then everything's lost and","The Trial"
"37991",7849,"it all has to start all over again. That's why I let Block sleep here,","The Trial"
"37992",7849,"it wouldn't be the first time Dr. Huld has wanted to see him in the","The Trial"
"37993",7849,"night. So now Block is ready for that. Sometimes, when he knows Block is","The Trial"
"37994",7849,"still here, he'll even change his mind about letting him in to see him.""","The Trial"
"37995",7849,"K. looked questioningly at the businessman. The latter nodded and,","The Trial"
"37996",7849,"although he had spoken quite openly with K. earlier, seemed to be","The Trial"
"37997",7849,"confused with shame as he said, ""Yes, later on you become very dependent","The Trial"
"37998",7849,"on your lawyer."" ""He's only pretending to mind,"" said Leni. ""He likes to","The Trial"
"37999",7849,"sleep here really, he's often said so."" She went over to a little door","The Trial"
"38000",7849,"and shoved it open. ""Do you want to see his bedroom?"" she asked. K.","The Trial"
"38001",7849,"went over to the low, windowless room and looked in from the doorway.","The Trial"
"38002",7849,"The room contained a narrow bed which filled it completely, so that to","The Trial"
"38003",7849,"get into the bed you would need to climb over the bedpost. At the head","The Trial"
"38004",7849,"of the bed there was a niche in the wall where, fastidiously tidy, stood","The Trial"
"38005",7849,"a candle, a bottle of ink, and a pen with a bundle of papers which were","The Trial"
"38006",7849,"probably to do with the trial. ""You sleep in the maid's room?"" asked","The Trial"
"38007",7849,"K., as he went back to the businessman. ""Leni's let me have it,""","The Trial"
"38008",7849,"answered the businessman, ""it has many advantages."" K. looked long at","The Trial"
"38009",7849,"him; his first impression of the businessman had perhaps not been right;","The Trial"
"38010",7849,"he had experience as his trial had already lasted a long time, but he","The Trial"
"38011",7849,"had paid a heavy price for this experience. K. was suddenly unable to","The Trial"
"38012",7849,"bear the sight of the businessman any longer. ""Bring him to bed, then!""","The Trial"
"38013",7849,"he called out to Leni, who seemed to understand him. For himself, he","The Trial"
"38014",7849,"wanted to go to the lawyer and, by dismissing him, free himself from not","The Trial"
"38015",7849,"only the lawyer but also from Leni and the businessman. But before he","The Trial"
"38016",7849,"had reached the door the businessman spoke to him gently. ""Excuse me,","The Trial"
"38017",7849,"sir,"" he said, and K. looked round crossly. ""You've forgotten your","The Trial"
"38018",7849,"promise,"" said the businessman, stretching his hand out to K.","The Trial"
"38019",7849,"imploringly from where he sat. ""You were going to tell me a secret.""","The Trial"
"38020",7849,"""That is true,"" said K., as he glanced at Leni, who was watching him","The Trial"
"38021",7849,"carefully, to check on her. ""So listen; it's hardly a secret now anyway.","The Trial"
"38022",7849,"I'm going to see the lawyer now to sack him."" ""He's sacking him!"" yelled","The Trial"
"38023",7849,"the businessman, and he jumped up from his chair and ran around the","The Trial"
"38024",7849,"kitchen with his arms in the air. He kept on shouting, ""He's sacking his","The Trial"
"38025",7849,"lawyer!"" Leni tried to rush at K. but the businessman got in her way so","The Trial"
"38026",7849,"that she shoved him away with her fists. Then, still with her hands","The Trial"
"38027",7849,"balled into fists, she ran after K. who, however, had been given a long","The Trial"
"38028",7849,"start. He was already inside the lawyer's room by the time Leni caught","The Trial"
"38029",7849,"up with him. He had almost closed the door behind himself, but Leni held","The Trial"
"38030",7849,"the door open with her foot, grabbed his arm and tried to pull him back.","The Trial"
"38031",7849,"But he put such pressure on her wrist that, with a sigh, she was forced","The Trial"
"38032",7849,"to release him. She did not dare go into the room straight away, and K.","The Trial"
"38033",7849,"locked the door with the key.</p>","The Trial"
"38034",7849,"","The Trial"
"38035",7849,"<p>""I've been waiting for you a very long time,"" said the lawyer from his","The Trial"
"38036",7849,"bed. He had been reading something by the light of a candle but now he","The Trial"
"38037",7849,"laid it onto the bedside table and put his glasses on, looking at K.","The Trial"
"38038",7849,"sharply through them. Instead of apologising K. said, ""I'll be leaving","The Trial"
"38039",7849,"again soon."" As he had not apologised the lawyer ignored what K. said,","The Trial"
"38040",7849,"and replied, ""I won't let you in this late again next time."" ""I find","The Trial"
"38041",7849,"that quite acceptable,"" said K. The lawyer looked at him quizzically.","The Trial"
"38042",7849,"""Sit down,"" he said. ""As you wish,"" said K., drawing a chair up to the","The Trial"
"38043",7849,"bedside table and sitting down. ""It seemed to me that you locked the","The Trial"
"38044",7849,"door,"" said the lawyer. ""Yes,"" said K., ""it was because of Leni."" He","The Trial"
"38045",7849,"had no intention of letting anyone off lightly. But the lawyer asked","The Trial"
"38046",7849,"him, ""Was she being importunate again?"" ""Importunate?"" asked K. ""Yes,""","The Trial"
"38047",7849,"said the lawyer, laughing as he did so, had a fit of coughing and then,","The Trial"
"38048",7849,"once it had passed, began to laugh again. ""I'm sure you must have","The Trial"
"38049",7849,"noticed how importunate she can be sometimes,"" he said, and patted K.'s","The Trial"
"38050",7849,"hand which K. had rested on the bedside table and which he now snatched","The Trial"
"38051",7849,"back. ""You don't attach much importance to it, then,"" said the lawyer","The Trial"
"38052",7849,"when K. was silent, ""so much the better. Otherwise I might have needed","The Trial"
"38053",7849,"to apologise to you. It is a peculiarity of Leni's. I've long since","The Trial"
"38054",7849,"forgiven her for it, and I wouldn't be talking of it now, if you hadn't","The Trial"
"38055",7849,"locked the door just now. Anyway, perhaps I should at least explain this","The Trial"
"38056",7849,"peculiarity of hers to you, but you seem rather disturbed, the way","The Trial"
"38057",7849,"you're looking at me, and so that's why I'll do it, this peculiarity of","The Trial"
"38058",7849,"hers consists in this: Leni finds most of the accused attractive. She","The Trial"
"38059",7849,"attaches herself to each of them, loves each of them, even seems to be","The Trial"
"38060",7849,"loved by each of them; then she sometimes entertains me by telling me","The Trial"
"38061",7849,"about them when I allow her to. I am not so astonished by all of this as","The Trial"
"38062",7849,"you seem to be. If you look at them in the right way the accused really","The Trial"
"38063",7849,"can be attractive, quite often. But that is a remarkable and to some","The Trial"
"38064",7849,"extent scientific phenomenon. Being indicted does not cause any clear,","The Trial"
"38065",7849,"precisely definable change in a person's appearance, of course. But","The Trial"
"38066",7849,"it's not like with other legal matters, most of them remain in their","The Trial"
"38067",7849,"usual way of life and, if they have a good lawyer looking after them,","The Trial"
"38068",7849,"the trial doesn't get in their way. But there are nonetheless those who","The Trial"
"38069",7849,"have experience in these matters who can look at a crowd, however big,","The Trial"
"38070",7849,"and tell you which among them is facing a charge. How can they do that,","The Trial"
"38071",7849,"you will ask? My answer will not please you. It is simply that those who","The Trial"
"38072",7849,"are facing a charge are the most attractive. It cannot be their guilt","The Trial"
"38073",7849,"that makes them attractive as not all of them are guilty&mdash;at least","The Trial"
"38074",7849,"that's what I, as a lawyer, have to say&mdash;and nor can it be the proper","The Trial"
"38075",7849,"punishment that has made them attractive as not all of them are","The Trial"
"38076",7849,"punished, so it can only be that the proceedings levelled against them","The Trial"
"38077",7849,"take some kind of hold on them. Whatever the reason, some of these","The Trial"
"38078",7849,"attractive people are indeed very attractive. But all of them are","The Trial"
"38079",7849,"attractive, even Block, pitiful worm that he is."" As the lawyer","The Trial"
"38080",7849,"finished what he was saying, K. was fully in control of himself, he had","The Trial"
"38081",7849,"even nodded conspicuously at his last few words in order to confirm to","The Trial"
"38082",7849,"himself the view he had already formed: that the lawyer was trying to","The Trial"
"38083",7849,"confuse him, as he always did, by making general and irrelevant","The Trial"
"38084",7849,"observations, and thus distract him from the main question of what he","The Trial"
"38085",7849,"was actually doing for K.'s trial. The lawyer must have noticed that K.","The Trial"
"38086",7849,"was offering him more resistance than before, as he became silent,","The Trial"
"38087",7849,"giving K. the chance to speak himself, and then, as K. also remained","The Trial"
"38088",7849,"silent, he asked, ""Did you have a particular reason for coming to see","The Trial"
"38089",7849,"me today?"" ""Yes,"" said K., putting his hand up to slightly shade his","The Trial"
"38090",7849,"eyes from the light of the candle so that he could see the lawyer","The Trial"
"38091",7849,"better, ""I wanted to tell you that I'm withdrawing my representation","The Trial"
"38092",7849,"from you, with immediate effect."" ""Do I understand you rightly?"" asked","The Trial"
"38093",7849,"the lawyer as he half raised himself in his bed and supported himself","The Trial"
"38094",7849,"with one hand on the pillow. ""I think you do,"" said K., sitting stiffly","The Trial"
"38095",7849,"upright as if waiting in ambush. ""Well we can certainly discuss this","The Trial"
"38096",7849,"plan of yours,"" said the lawyer after a pause. ""It's not a plan any","The Trial"
"38097",7849,"more,"" said K. ""That may be,"" said the lawyer, ""but we still mustn't","The Trial"
"38098",7849,"rush anything."" He used the word 'we', as if he had no intention of","The Trial"
"38099",7849,"letting K. go free, and as if, even if he could no longer represent him,","The Trial"
"38100",7849,"he could still at least continue as his adviser. ""Nothing is being","The Trial"
"38101",7849,"rushed,"" said K., standing slowly up and going behind his chair,","The Trial"
"38102",7849,"""everything has been well thought out and probably even for too long.","The Trial"
"38103",7849,"The decision is final."" ""Then allow me to say a few words,"" said the","The Trial"
"38104",7849,"lawyer, throwing the bed cover to one side and sitting on the edge of","The Trial"
"38105",7849,"the bed. His naked, white-haired legs shivered in the cold. He asked K.","The Trial"
"38106",7849,"to pass him a blanket from the couch. K. passed him the blanket and","The Trial"
"38107",7849,"said, ""You are running the risk of catching cold for no reason."" ""The","The Trial"
"38108",7849,"circumstances are important enough,"" said the lawyer as he wrapped the","The Trial"
"38109",7849,"bed cover around the top half of his body and then the blanket around","The Trial"
"38110",7849,"his legs. ""Your uncle is my friend and in the course of time I've become","The Trial"
"38111",7849,"fond of you as well. I admit that quite openly. There's nothing in that","The Trial"
"38112",7849,"for me to be ashamed of."" It was very unwelcome for K. to hear the old","The Trial"
"38113",7849,"man speak in this touching way, as it forced him to explain himself more","The Trial"
"38114",7849,"fully, which he would rather have avoided, and he was aware that it also","The Trial"
"38115",7849,"confused him even though it could never make him reverse his decision.","The Trial"
"38116",7849,"""Thank you for feeling so friendly toward me,"" he said, ""and I also","The Trial"
"38117",7849,"realise how deeply involved you've been in my case, as deeply as","The Trial"
"38118",7849,"possible for yourself and to bring as much advantage as possible to me.","The Trial"
"38119",7849,"Nonetheless, I have recently come to the conviction that it is not","The Trial"
"38120",7849,"enough. I would naturally never attempt, considering that you are so","The Trial"
"38121",7849,"much older and more experienced than I am, to convince you of my","The Trial"
"38122",7849,"opinion; if I have ever unintentionally done so then I beg your","The Trial"
"38123",7849,"forgiveness, but, as you have just said yourself, the circumstances are","The Trial"
"38124",7849,"important enough and it is my belief that my trial needs to be","The Trial"
"38125",7849,"approached with much more vigour than has so far been the case."" ""I","The Trial"
"38126",7849,"see,"" said the lawyer, ""you've become impatient."" ""I am not impatient,""","The Trial"
"38127",7849,"said K., with some irritation and he stopped paying so much attention to","The Trial"
"38128",7849,"his choice of words. ""When I first came here with my uncle you probably","The Trial"
"38129",7849,"noticed I wasn't greatly concerned about my case, and if I wasn't","The Trial"
"38130",7849,"reminded of it by force, as it were, I would forget about it completely.","The Trial"
"38131",7849,"But my uncle insisted I should allow you to represent me and I did so as","The Trial"
"38132",7849,"a favour to him. I could have expected the case to be less of a burden","The Trial"
"38133",7849,"than it had been, as the point of taking on a lawyer is that he should","The Trial"
"38134",7849,"take on some of its weight. But what actually happened was the opposite.","The Trial"
"38135",7849,"Before, the trial was never such a worry for me as it has been since","The Trial"
"38136",7849,"you've been representing me. When I was by myself I never did anything","The Trial"
"38137",7849,"about my case, I was hardly aware of it, but then, once there was","The Trial"
"38138",7849,"someone representing me, everything was set for something to happen, I","The Trial"
"38139",7849,"was always, without cease, waiting for you to do something, getting more","The Trial"
"38140",7849,"and more tense, but you did nothing. I did get some information about","The Trial"
"38141",7849,"the court from you that I probably could not have got anywhere else, but","The Trial"
"38142",7849,"that can't be enough when the trial, supposedly in secret, is getting","The Trial"
"38143",7849,"closer and closer to me."" K. had pushed the chair away and stood erect,","The Trial"
"38144",7849,"his hands in the pockets of his frock coat. ""After a certain point in","The Trial"
"38145",7849,"the proceedings,"" said the lawyer quietly and calmly, ""nothing new of","The Trial"
"38146",7849,"any importance ever happens. So many litigants, at the same stage in","The Trial"
"38147",7849,"their trials, have stood before me just like you are now and spoken in","The Trial"
"38148",7849,"the same way."" ""Then these other litigants,"" said K., ""have all been","The Trial"
"38149",7849,"right, just as I am. That does not show that I'm not."" ""I wasn't trying","The Trial"
"38150",7849,"to show that you were mistaken,"" said the lawyer, ""but I wanted to add","The Trial"
"38151",7849,"that I expected better judgement from you than from the others,","The Trial"
"38152",7849,"especially as I've given you more insight into the workings of the court","The Trial"
"38153",7849,"and my own activities than I normally do. And now I'm forced to accept","The Trial"
"38154",7849,"that, despite everything, you have too little trust in me. You don't","The Trial"
"38155",7849,"make it easy for me."" How the lawyer was humiliating himself to K.! He","The Trial"
"38156",7849,"was showing no regard for the dignity of his position, which on this","The Trial"
"38157",7849,"point, must have been at its most sensitive. And why did he do that? He","The Trial"
"38158",7849,"did seem to be very busy as a lawyer as well a rich man, neither the","The Trial"
"38159",7849,"loss of income nor the loss of a client could have been of much","The Trial"
"38160",7849,"importance to him in themselves. He was moreover unwell and should have","The Trial"
"38161",7849,"been thinking of passing work on to others. And despite all that he held","The Trial"
"38162",7849,"on tightly to K. Why? Was it something personal for his uncle's sake, or","The Trial"
"38163",7849,"did he really see K.'s case as one that was exceptional and hoped to be","The Trial"
"38164",7849,"able to distinguish himself with it, either for K.'s sake or&mdash;and this","The Trial"
"38165",7849,"possibility could never be excluded&mdash;for his friends at the court. It","The Trial"
"38166",7849,"was not possible to learn anything by looking at him, even though K. was","The Trial"
"38167",7849,"scrutinizing him quite brazenly. It could almost be supposed he was","The Trial"
"38168",7849,"deliberately hiding his thoughts as he waited to see what effect his","The Trial"
"38169",7849,"words would have. But he clearly deemed K.'s silence to be favourable","The Trial"
"38170",7849,"for himself and he continued, ""You will have noticed the size of my","The Trial"
"38171",7849,"office, but that I don't employ any staff to help me. That used to be","The Trial"
"38172",7849,"quite different, there was a time when several young lawyers were","The Trial"
"38173",7849,"working for me but now I work alone. This is partly to do with changes","The Trial"
"38174",7849,"in the way I do business, in that I concentrate nowadays more and more","The Trial"
"38175",7849,"on matters such as your own case, and partly to do with the ever deeper","The Trial"
"38176",7849,"understanding that I acquire from these legal matters. I found that I","The Trial"
"38177",7849,"could never let anyone else deal with this sort of work unless I wanted","The Trial"
"38178",7849,"to harm both the client and the job I had taken on. But the decision to","The Trial"
"38179",7849,"do all the work myself had its obvious result: I was forced to turn","The Trial"
"38180",7849,"almost everyone away who asked me to represent them and could only","The Trial"
"38181",7849,"accept those I was especially interested in&mdash;well there are enough","The Trial"
"38182",7849,"creatures who leap at every crumb I throw down, and they're not so very","The Trial"
"38183",7849,"far away. Most importantly, I became ill from over-work. But despite","The Trial"
"38184",7849,"that I don't regret my decision, quite possibly I should have turned","The Trial"
"38185",7849,"more cases away than I did, but it did turn out to be entirely necessary","The Trial"
"38186",7849,"for me to devote myself fully to the cases I did take on, and the","The Trial"
"38187",7849,"successful results showed that it was worth it. I once read a","The Trial"
"38188",7849,"description of the difference between representing someone in ordinary","The Trial"
"38189",7849,"legal matters and in legal matters of this sort, and the writer","The Trial"
"38190",7849,"expressed it very well. This is what he said: some lawyers lead their","The Trial"
"38191",7849,"clients on a thread until judgement is passed, but there are others who","The Trial"
"38192",7849,"immediately lift their clients onto their shoulders and carry them all","The Trial"
"38193",7849,"the way to the judgement and beyond. That's just how it is. But it was","The Trial"
"38194",7849,"quite true when I said I never regret all this work. But if, as in your","The Trial"
"38195",7849,"case, they are so fully misunderstood, well, then I come very close to","The Trial"
"38196",7849,"regretting it."" All this talking did more to make K. impatient than to","The Trial"
"38197",7849,"persuade him. From the way the lawyer was speaking, K. thought he could","The Trial"
"38198",7849,"hear what he could expect if he gave in, the delays and excuses would","The Trial"
"38199",7849,"begin again, reports of how the documents were progressing, how the mood","The Trial"
"38200",7849,"of the court officials had improved, as well as all the enormous","The Trial"
"38201",7849,"difficulties&mdash;in short all that he had heard so many times before would","The Trial"
"38202",7849,"be brought out again even more fully, he would try to mislead K. with","The Trial"
"38203",7849,"hopes that were never specified and to make him suffer with threats that","The Trial"
"38204",7849,"were never clear. He had to put a stop to that, so he said, ""What will","The Trial"
"38205",7849,"you undertake on my behalf if you continue to represent me?"" The lawyer","The Trial"
"38206",7849,"quietly accepted even this insulting question, and answered, ""I should","The Trial"
"38207",7849,"continue with what I've already been doing for you."" ""That's just what I","The Trial"
"38208",7849,"thought,"" said K., ""and now you don't need to say another word."" ""I will","The Trial"
"38209",7849,"make one more attempt,"" said the lawyer as if whatever had been making","The Trial"
"38210",7849,"K. so annoyed was affecting him too. ""You see, I have the impression","The Trial"
"38211",7849,"that you have not only misjudged the legal assistance I have given you","The Trial"
"38212",7849,"but also that that misjudgement has led you to behave in this way, you","The Trial"
"38213",7849,"seem, although you are the accused, to have been treated too well or, to","The Trial"
"38214",7849,"put it a better way, handled with neglect, with apparent neglect. Even","The Trial"
"38215",7849,"that has its reason; it is often better to be in chains than to be free.","The Trial"
"38216",7849,"But I would like to show you how other defendants are treated, perhaps","The Trial"
"38217",7849,"you will succeed in learning something from it. What I will do is I will","The Trial"
"38218",7849,"call Block in, unlock the door and sit down here beside the bedside","The Trial"
"38219",7849,"table."" ""Be glad to,"" said K., and did as the lawyer suggested; he was","The Trial"
"38220",7849,"always ready to learn something new. But to make sure of himself for any","The Trial"
"38221",7849,"event he added, ""but you do realise that you are no longer to be my","The Trial"
"38222",7849,"lawyer, don't you?"" ""Yes,"" said the lawyer. ""But you can still change","The Trial"
"38223",7849,"your mind today if you want to."" He lay back down in the bed, pulled the","The Trial"
"38224",7849,"quilt up to his chin and turned to face the wall. Then he rang.</p>","The Trial"
"38225",7849,"","The Trial"
"38226",7849,"<p>Leni appeared almost the moment he had done so. She looked hurriedly at","The Trial"
"38227",7849,"K. and the lawyer to try and find out what had happened; she seemed to","The Trial"
"38228",7849,"be reassured by the sight of K. sitting calmly at the lawyer's bed. She","The Trial"
"38229",7849,"smiled and nodded to K., K. looked blankly back at her. ""Fetch Block,""","The Trial"
"38230",7849,"said the lawyer. But instead of going to fetch him, Leni just went to","The Trial"
"38231",7849,"the door and called out, ""Block! To the lawyer!"" Then, probably because","The Trial"
"38232",7849,"the lawyer had turned his face to the wall and was paying no attention,","The Trial"
"38233",7849,"she slipped in behind K.'s chair. From then on, she bothered him by","The Trial"
"38234",7849,"leaning forward over the back of the chair or, albeit very tenderly and","The Trial"
"38235",7849,"carefully, she would run her hands through his hair and over his","The Trial"
"38236",7849,"cheeks. K. eventually tried to stop her by taking hold of one hand, and","The Trial"
"38237",7849,"after some resistance Leni let him keep hold of it. Block came as soon","The Trial"
"38238",7849,"as he was called, but he remained standing in the doorway and seemed to","The Trial"
"38239",7849,"be wondering whether he should enter or not. He raised his eyebrows and","The Trial"
"38240",7849,"lowered his head as if listening to find out whether the order to","The Trial"
"38241",7849,"attend the lawyer would be repeated. K. could have encouraged him to","The Trial"
"38242",7849,"enter, but he had decided to make a final break not only with the","The Trial"
"38243",7849,"lawyer but with everything in his home, so he kept himself motionless.","The Trial"
"38244",7849,"Leni was also silent. Block noticed that at least no-one was chasing","The Trial"
"38245",7849,"him away, and, on tiptoe, he entered the room, his face was tense, his","The Trial"
"38246",7849,"hands were clenched behind his back. He left the door open in case he","The Trial"
"38247",7849,"needed to go back again. K. did not even glance at him, he looked","The Trial"
"38248",7849,"instead only at the thick quilt under which the lawyer could not be seen","The Trial"
"38249",7849,"as he had squeezed up very close to the wall. Then his voice was heard:","The Trial"
"38250",7849,"""Block here?"" he asked. Block had already crept some way into the room","The Trial"
"38251",7849,"but this question seemed to give him first a shove in the breast and","The Trial"
"38252",7849,"then another in the back, he seemed about to fall but remained","The Trial"
"38253",7849,"standing, deeply bowed, and said, ""At your service, sir."" ""What do you","The Trial"
"38254",7849,"want?"" asked the lawyer, ""you've come at a bad time."" ""Wasn't I","The Trial"
"38255",7849,"summoned?"" asked Block, more to himself than the lawyer. He held his","The Trial"
"38256",7849,"hands in front of himself as protection and would have been ready to run","The Trial"
"38257",7849,"away any moment. ""You were summoned,"" said the lawyer, ""but you have","The Trial"
"38258",7849,"still come at a bad time."" Then, after a pause he added, ""You always","The Trial"
"38259",7849,"come at a bad time."" When the lawyer started speaking Block had stopped","The Trial"
"38260",7849,"looking at the bed but stared rather into one of the corners, just","The Trial"
"38261",7849,"listening, as if the light from the speaker were brighter than Block","The Trial"
"38262",7849,"could bear to look at. But it was also difficult for him to listen, as","The Trial"
"38263",7849,"the lawyer was speaking into the wall and speaking quickly and quietly.","The Trial"
"38264",7849,"""Would you like me to go away again, sir?"" asked Block. ""Well you're","The Trial"
"38265",7849,"here now,"" said the lawyer. ""Stay!"" It was as if the lawyer had not done","The Trial"
"38266",7849,"as Block had wanted but instead threatened him with a stick, as now","The Trial"
"38267",7849,"Block really began to shake. ""I went to see,"" said the lawyer, ""the","The Trial"
"38268",7849,"third judge yesterday, a friend of mine, and slowly brought the","The Trial"
"38269",7849,"conversation round to the subject of you. Do you want to know what he","The Trial"
"38270",7849,"said?"" ""Oh, yes please,"" said Block. The lawyer did not answer","The Trial"
"38271",7849,"immediately, so Block repeated his request and lowered his head as if","The Trial"
"38272",7849,"about to kneel down. But then K. spoke to him: ""What do you think you're","The Trial"
"38273",7849,"doing?"" he shouted. Leni had wanted to stop him from calling out and so","The Trial"
"38274",7849,"he took hold of her other hand. It was not love that made him squeeze it","The Trial"
"38275",7849,"and hold on to it so tightly, she sighed frequently and tried to","The Trial"
"38276",7849,"disengage her hands from him. But Block was punished for K.'s outburst,","The Trial"
"38277",7849,"as the lawyer asked him, ""Who is your lawyer?"" ""You are, sir,"" said","The Trial"
"38278",7849,"Block. ""And who besides me?"" the lawyer asked. ""No-one besides you,","The Trial"
"38279",7849,"sir,"" said Block. ""And let there be no-one besides me,"" said the lawyer.","The Trial"
"38280",7849,"Block fully understood what that meant, he glowered at K., shaking his","The Trial"
"38281",7849,"head violently. If these actions had been translated into words they","The Trial"
"38282",7849,"would have been coarse insults. K. had been friendly and willing to","The Trial"
"38283",7849,"discuss his own case with someone like this! ""I won't disturb you any","The Trial"
"38284",7849,"more,"" said K., leaning back in his chair. ""You can kneel down or creep","The Trial"
"38285",7849,"on all fours, whatever you like. I won't bother with you any more."" But","The Trial"
"38286",7849,"Block still had some sense of pride, at least where K. was concerned,","The Trial"
"38287",7849,"and he went towards him waving his fists, shouting as loudly as he dared","The Trial"
"38288",7849,"while the lawyer was there. ""You shouldn't speak to me like that, that's","The Trial"
"38289",7849,"not allowed. Why are you insulting me? Especially here in front of the","The Trial"
"38290",7849,"lawyer, where both of us, you and me, we're only tolerated because of","The Trial"
"38291",7849,"his charity. You're not a better person than me, you've been accused of","The Trial"
"38292",7849,"something too, you're facing a charge too. If, in spite of that, you're","The Trial"
"38293",7849,"still a gentleman then I'm just as much a gentleman as you are, if not","The Trial"
"38294",7849,"even more so. And I want to be spoken to as a gentleman, especially by","The Trial"
"38295",7849,"you. If you think being allowed to sit there and quietly listen while I","The Trial"
"38296",7849,"creep on all fours as you put it makes you something better than me,","The Trial"
"38297",7849,"then there's an old legal saying you ought to bear in mind: If you're","The Trial"
"38298",7849,"under suspicion it's better to be moving than still, as if you're still","The Trial"
"38299",7849,"you can be in the pan of the scales without knowing it and be weighed","The Trial"
"38300",7849,"along with your sins."" K. said nothing. He merely looked in amazement at","The Trial"
"38301",7849,"this distracted being, his eyes completely still. He had gone through","The Trial"
"38302",7849,"such changes in just the last few hours! Was it the trial that was","The Trial"
"38303",7849,"throwing him from side to side in this way and stopped him knowing who","The Trial"
"38304",7849,"was friend and who was foe? Could he not see the lawyer was deliberately","The Trial"
"38305",7849,"humiliating him and had no other purpose today than to show off his","The Trial"
"38306",7849,"power to K., and perhaps even thereby subjugate K.? But if Block was","The Trial"
"38307",7849,"incapable of seeing that, or if he so feared the lawyer that no such","The Trial"
"38308",7849,"insight would even be of any use to him, how was it that he was either","The Trial"
"38309",7849,"so sly or so bold as to lie to the lawyer and conceal from him the fact","The Trial"
"38310",7849,"that he had other lawyers working on his behalf? And how did he dare to","The Trial"
"38311",7849,"attack K., who could betray his secret any time he liked? But he dared","The Trial"
"38312",7849,"even more than this, he went to the lawyer's bed and began there to make","The Trial"
"38313",7849,"complaints about K. ""Dr. Huld, sir,"" he said, ""did you hear the way this","The Trial"
"38314",7849,"man spoke to me? You can count the length of his trial in hours, and he","The Trial"
"38315",7849,"wants to tell me what to do when I've been involved in a legal case for","The Trial"
"38316",7849,"five years. He even insults me. He doesn't know anything, but he insults","The Trial"
"38317",7849,"me, when I, as far as my weak ability allows, when I've made a close","The Trial"
"38318",7849,"study of how to behave with the court, what we ought to do and what the","The Trial"
"38319",7849,"court practices are."" ""Don't let anyone bother you,"" said the lawyer,","The Trial"
"38320",7849,"""and do what seems to you to be right."" ""I will,"" said Block, as if","The Trial"
"38321",7849,"speaking to himself to give himself courage, and with a quick glance to","The Trial"
"38322",7849,"the side he knelt down close beside the bed. ""I'm kneeling now, Dr.","The Trial"
"38323",7849,"Huld, sir,"" he said. But the lawyer remained silent. With one hand,","The Trial"
"38324",7849,"Block carefully stroked the bed cover. In the silence while he did so,","The Trial"
"38325",7849,"Leni, as she freed herself from K.'s hands, said, ""You're hurting me.","The Trial"
"38326",7849,"Let go of me. I'm going over to Block."" She went over to him and sat on","The Trial"
"38327",7849,"the edge of the bed. Block was very pleased at this and with lively,","The Trial"
"38328",7849,"but silent, gestures he immediately urged her to intercede for him with","The Trial"
"38329",7849,"the lawyer. It was clear that he desperately needed to be told something","The Trial"
"38330",7849,"by the lawyer, although perhaps only so that he could make use of the","The Trial"
"38331",7849,"information with his other lawyers. Leni probably knew very well how","The Trial"
"38332",7849,"the lawyer could be brought round, pointed to his hand and pursed her","The Trial"
"38333",7849,"lips as if making a kiss. Block immediately performed the hand-kiss and,","The Trial"
"38334",7849,"at further urging from Leni, repeated it twice more. But the lawyer","The Trial"
"38335",7849,"continued to be silent. Then Leni leant over the lawyer, as she","The Trial"
"38336",7849,"stretched out, the attractive shape of her body could be seen, and,","The Trial"
"38337",7849,"bent over close to his face, she stroked his long white hair. That now","The Trial"
"38338",7849,"forced him to give an answer. ""I'm rather wary of telling him,"" said","The Trial"
"38339",7849,"the lawyer, and his head could be seen shaking slightly, perhaps so that","The Trial"
"38340",7849,"he would feel the pressure of Leni's hand better. Block listened","The Trial"
"38341",7849,"closely with his head lowered, as if by listening he were breaking an","The Trial"
"38342",7849,"order. ""What makes you so wary about it?"" asked Leni. K. had the feeling","The Trial"
"38343",7849,"he was listening to a contrived dialogue that had been repeated many","The Trial"
"38344",7849,"times, that would be repeated many times more, and that for Block alone","The Trial"
"38345",7849,"it would never lose its freshness. ""What has his behaviour been like","The Trial"
"38346",7849,"today?"" asked the lawyer instead of an answer. Before Leni said","The Trial"
"38347",7849,"anything she looked down at Block and watched him a short while as he","The Trial"
"38348",7849,"raised his hands towards her and rubbed them together imploringly.","The Trial"
"38349",7849,"Finally she gave a serious nod, turned back to the lawyer and said,","The Trial"
"38350",7849,"""He's been quiet and industrious."" This was an elderly businessman, a","The Trial"
"38351",7849,"man whose beard was long, and he was begging a young girl to speak on","The Trial"
"38352",7849,"his behalf. Even if there was some plan behind what he did, there was","The Trial"
"38353",7849,"nothing that could reinstate him in the eyes of his fellow man. K. could","The Trial"
"38354",7849,"not understand how the lawyer could have thought this performance would","The Trial"
"38355",7849,"win him over. Even if he had done nothing earlier to make him want to","The Trial"
"38356",7849,"leave then this scene would have done so. It was almost humiliating even","The Trial"
"38357",7849,"for the onlooker. So these were the lawyer's methods, which K.","The Trial"
"38358",7849,"fortunately had not been exposed to for long, to let the client forget","The Trial"
"38359",7849,"about the whole world and leave him with nothing but the hope of","The Trial"
"38360",7849,"reaching the end of his trial by this deluded means. He was no longer a","The Trial"
"38361",7849,"client, he was the lawyer's dog. If the lawyer had ordered him to crawl","The Trial"
"38362",7849,"under the bed as if it were a kennel and to bark out from under it, then","The Trial"
"38363",7849,"he would have done so with enthusiasm. K. listened to all of this,","The Trial"
"38364",7849,"testing it and thinking it over as if he had been given the task of","The Trial"
"38365",7849,"closely observing everything spoken here, inform a higher office about","The Trial"
"38366",7849,"it and write a report. ""And what has he been doing all day?"" asked the","The Trial"
"38367",7849,"lawyer. ""I kept him locked in the maid's room all day,"" said Leni, ""so","The Trial"
"38368",7849,"that he wouldn't stop me doing my work. That's where he usually stays.","The Trial"
"38369",7849,"From time to time I looked in through the spyhole to see what he was","The Trial"
"38370",7849,"doing, and each time he was kneeling on the bed and reading the papers","The Trial"
"38371",7849,"you gave him, propped up on the window sill. That made a good impression","The Trial"
"38372",7849,"on me; as the window only opens onto an air shaft and gives hardly any","The Trial"
"38373",7849,"light. It showed how obedient he is that he was even reading in those","The Trial"
"38374",7849,"conditions."" ""I'm pleased to hear it,"" said the lawyer. ""But did he","The Trial"
"38375",7849,"understand what he was reading?"" While this conversation was going on,","The Trial"
"38376",7849,"Block continually moved his lips and was clearly formulating the answers","The Trial"
"38377",7849,"he hoped Leni would give. ""Well I can't give you any certain answer to","The Trial"
"38378",7849,"that of course,"" said Leni, ""but I could see that he was reading","The Trial"
"38379",7849,"thoroughly. He spent all day reading the same page, running his finger","The Trial"
"38380",7849,"along the lines. Whenever I looked in on him he sighed as if this","The Trial"
"38381",7849,"reading was a lot of work for him. I expect the papers you gave him were","The Trial"
"38382",7849,"very hard to understand."" ""Yes,"" said the lawyer, ""they certainly are","The Trial"
"38383",7849,"that. And I really don't think he understood anything of them. But they","The Trial"
"38384",7849,"should at least give him some inkling of just how hard a struggle it is","The Trial"
"38385",7849,"and how much work it is for me to defend him. And who am I doing all","The Trial"

"38388",7849,"study without a pause?"" ""Almost without a pause,"" answered Leni. ""Just","The Trial"
"38389",7849,"the once he asked me for a drink of water, so I gave him a glassful","The Trial"

"38392",7849,"praised and had to impress K. as well. He now seemed more optimistic, he","The Trial"
"38393",7849,"moved more freely and rocked back and forth on his knees. This made his","The Trial"
"38394",7849,"astonishment all the more obvious when he heard the following words from","The Trial"
"38395",7849,"the lawyer: ""You speak well of him,"" said the lawyer, ""but that's just","The Trial"
"38396",7849,"what makes it difficult for me. You see, the judge did not speak well of","The Trial"
"38397",7849,"him at all, neither about Block nor about his case."" ""Didn't speak well","The Trial"
"38398",7849,"of him?"" asked Leni. ""How is that possible?"" Block looked at her with","The Trial"
"38399",7849,"such tension he seemed to think that although the judge's words had been","The Trial"
"38400",7849,"spoken so long before she would be able to change them in his favour.","The Trial"
"38401",7849,"""Not at all,"" said the lawyer. ""In fact he became quite cross when I","The Trial"
"38402",7849,"started to talk about Block to him. 'Don't talk to me about Block,' he","The Trial"
"38403",7849,"said. 'He is my client,' said I. 'You're letting him abuse you,' he","The Trial"
"38404",7849,"said. 'I don't think his case is lost yet,' said I. 'You're letting him","The Trial"
"38405",7849,"abuse you,' he repeated. 'I don't think so,' said I. 'Block works hard","The Trial"
"38406",7849,"in his case and always knows where it stands. He practically lives with","The Trial"
"38407",7849,"me so that he always knows what's happening. You don't always find such","The Trial"
"38408",7849,"enthusiasm as that. He's not very pleasant personally, I grant you, his","The Trial"
"38409",7849,"manners are terrible and he's dirty, but as far as the trial's concerned","The Trial"
"38410",7849,"he's quite immaculate.' I said immaculate, but I was deliberately","The Trial"
"38411",7849,"exaggerating. Then he said, 'Block is sly, that's all. He's accumulated","The Trial"
"38412",7849,"plenty of experience and knows how to delay proceedings. But there's","The Trial"
"38413",7849,"more that he doesn't know than he does. What do you think he'd say if he","The Trial"
"38414",7849,"learned his trial still hasn't begun, if you told him they haven't even","The Trial"
"38415",7849,"rung the bell to announce the start of proceedings?' Alright Block,","The Trial"
"38416",7849,"alright,"" said the lawyer, as at these words Block had begun to raise","The Trial"
"38417",7849,"himself on his trembling knees and clearly wanted to plead for some","The Trial"
"38418",7849,"explanation. It was the first time the lawyer had spoken any clear words","The Trial"
"38419",7849,"directly to Block. He looked down with his tired eyes, half blankly and","The Trial"
"38420",7849,"half at Block, who slowly sank back down on his knees under this gaze.","The Trial"
"38421",7849,"""What the judge said has no meaning for you,"" said the lawyer. ""You","The Trial"
"38422",7849,"needn't be frightened at every word. If you do it again I won't tell you","The Trial"
"38423",7849,"anything else at all. It's impossible to start a sentence without you","The Trial"
"38424",7849,"looking at me as if you were receiving your final judgement. You should","The Trial"
"38425",7849,"be ashamed of yourself here in front of my client! And you're destroying","The Trial"
"38426",7849,"the trust he has for me. Just what is it you want? You're still alive,","The Trial"
"38427",7849,"you're still under my protection. There's no point in worrying!","The Trial"
"38428",7849,"Somewhere you've read that the final judgement can often come without","The Trial"
"38429",7849,"warning, from anyone at any time. And, in the right circumstances,","The Trial"
"38430",7849,"that's basically true, but it's also true that I dislike your anxiety","The Trial"
"38431",7849,"and fear and see that you don't have the trust in me you should have.","The Trial"
"38432",7849,"Now what have I just said? I repeated something said by one of the","The Trial"
"38433",7849,"judges. You know that there are so many various opinions about the","The Trial"
"38434",7849,"procedure that they form into a great big pile and nobody can make any","The Trial"
"38435",7849,"sense of them. This judge, for instance, sees proceedings as starting at","The Trial"
"38436",7849,"a different point from where I do. A difference of opinion, nothing","The Trial"
"38437",7849,"more. At a certain stage in the proceedings tradition has it that a sign","The Trial"
"38438",7849,"is given by ringing a bell. This judge sees that as the point at which","The Trial"
"38439",7849,"proceedings begin. I can't set out all the opinions opposed to that","The Trial"
"38440",7849,"view here, and you wouldn't understand it anyway, suffice it to say","The Trial"
"38441",7849,"that there are many reasons to disagree with him."" Embarrassed, Block","The Trial"

"38501",7849,"not being allowed back in was too great, he knew full well that the fear","The Trial"

"38503",7849,"was almost impossible to think of an acceptable excuse, his knowledge","The Trial"

"38515",7849,"prevent him. He had spent half the night studying a book of Italian","The Trial"

"38521",7849,"was already in his office; if he was, then would he please be so kind","The Trial"
"38522",7849,"as to come to his reception room as the gentleman from Italy was","The Trial"
"38523",7849,"already there. ""I'll come straight away,"" said K. He put a small","The Trial"

"38525",7849,"under his arm that he had compiled for strangers, and went through the","The Trial"

"38527",7849,"come into the office so early and was able to be of service","The Trial"
"38528",7849,"immediately, nobody could seriously have expected that of him. The","The Trial"
"38529",7849,"deputy director's office was, of course, still as empty as the middle","The Trial"
"38530",7849,"of the night, the servitor had probably been asked to summon him too","The Trial"
"38531",7849,"but without success. As K. entered the reception room two men stood up","The Trial"
"38532",7849,"from the deep armchairs where they had been sitting. The director gave","The Trial"
"38533",7849,"him a friendly smile, he was clearly very glad that K. was there, he","The Trial"
"38534",7849,"immediately introduced him to the Italian who shook K.'s hand","The Trial"
"38535",7849,"vigorously and joked that somebody was an early riser. K. did not quite","The Trial"
"38536",7849,"understand whom he had in mind, it was moreover an odd expression to use","The Trial"
"38537",7849,"and it took K. a little while to guess its meaning. He replied with a","The Trial"
"38538",7849,"few bland phrases which the Italian received once more with a laugh,","The Trial"
"38539",7849,"passing his hand nervously and repeatedly over his blue-grey, bushy","The Trial"
"38540",7849,"moustache. This moustache was obviously perfumed, it was almost tempting","The Trial"
"38541",7849,"to come close to it and sniff. When they had all sat down and begun a","The Trial"
"38542",7849,"light preliminary conversation, K. was disconcerted to notice that he","The Trial"
"38543",7849,"understood no more than fragments of what the Italian said. When he","The Trial"
"38544",7849,"spoke very calmly he understood almost everything, but that was very","The Trial"
"38545",7849,"infrequent, mostly the words gushed from his mouth and he seemed to be","The Trial"
"38546",7849,"enjoying himself so much his head shook. When he was talking in this","The Trial"
"38547",7849,"way his speech was usually wrapped up in some kind of dialect which","The Trial"
"38548",7849,"seemed to K. to have nothing to do with Italian but which the director","The Trial"
"38549",7849,"not only understood but also spoke, although K. ought to have foreseen","The Trial"
"38550",7849,"this as the Italian came from the south of his country where the","The Trial"
"38551",7849,"director had also spent several years. Whatever the cause, K. realised","The Trial"
"38552",7849,"that the possibility of communicating with the Italian had been largely","The Trial"
"38553",7849,"taken from him, even his French was difficult to understand, and his","The Trial"
"38554",7849,"moustache concealed the movements of his lips which might have offered","The Trial"
"38555",7849,"some help in understanding what he said. K. began to anticipate many","The Trial"
"38556",7849,"difficulties, he gave up trying to understand what the Italian","The Trial"
"38557",7849,"said&mdash;with the director there, who could understand him so easily, it","The Trial"
"38558",7849,"would have been pointless effort&mdash;and for the time being did no more","The Trial"
"38559",7849,"than scowl at the Italian as he relaxed sitting deep but comfortable in","The Trial"
"38560",7849,"the armchair, as he frequently pulled at his short, sharply tailored","The Trial"
"38561",7849,"jacket and at one time lifted his arms in the air and moved his hands","The Trial"
"38562",7849,"freely to try and depict something that K. could not grasp, even though","The Trial"
"38563",7849,"he was leaning forward and did not let the hands out of his sight. K.","The Trial"
"38564",7849,"had nothing to occupy himself but mechanically watch the exchange","The Trial"
"38565",7849,"between the two men and his tiredness finally made itself felt, to his","The Trial"
"38566",7849,"alarm, although fortunately in good time, he once caught himself nearly","The Trial"
"38567",7849,"getting up, turning round and leaving. Eventually the Italian looked at","The Trial"
"38568",7849,"the clock and jumped up. After taking his leave from the director he","The Trial"
"38569",7849,"turned to K., pressing himself so close to him that K. had to push his","The Trial"
"38570",7849,"chair back just so that he could move. The director had, no doubt, seen","The Trial"
"38571",7849,"the anxiety in K.'s eyes as he tried to cope with this dialect of","The Trial"
"38572",7849,"Italian, he joined in with this conversation in a way that was so","The Trial"
"38573",7849,"adroit and unobtrusive that he seemed to be adding no more than minor","The Trial"
"38574",7849,"comments, whereas in fact he was swiftly and patiently breaking into","The Trial"
"38575",7849,"what the Italian said so that K. could understand. K. learned in this","The Trial"
"38576",7849,"way that the Italian first had a few business matters to settle, that","The Trial"
"38577",7849,"he unfortunately had only a little time at his disposal, that he","The Trial"
"38578",7849,"certainly did not intend to rush round to see every monument in the","The Trial"
"38579",7849,"city, that he would much rather&mdash;at least as long as K. would agree, it","The Trial"
"38580",7849,"was entirely his decision&mdash;just see the cathedral and to do so","The Trial"
"38581",7849,"thoroughly. He was extremely pleased to be accompanied by someone who","The Trial"
"38582",7849,"was so learned and so pleasant&mdash;by this he meant K., who was occupied","The Trial"
"38583",7849,"not with listening to the Italian but the director&mdash;and asked if he","The Trial"
"38584",7849,"would be so kind, if the time was suitable, to meet him in the cathedral","The Trial"
"38585",7849,"in two hours' time at about ten o'clock. He hoped he would certainly be","The Trial"
"38586",7849,"able to be there at that time. K. made an appropriate reply, the Italian","The Trial"
"38587",7849,"shook first the director's hand and then K.'s, then the director's again","The Trial"
"38588",7849,"and went to the door, half turned to the two men who followed him and","The Trial"
"38589",7849,"continuing to talk without a break. K. remained together with the","The Trial"
"38590",7849,"director for a short while, although the director looked especially","The Trial"
"38591",7849,"unhappy today. He thought he needed to apologise to K. for something and","The Trial"
"38592",7849,"told him&mdash;they were standing intimately close together&mdash;he had thought","The Trial"
"38593",7849,"at first he would accompany the Italian himself, but then&mdash;he gave no","The Trial"
"38594",7849,"more precise reason than this&mdash;then he decided it would be better to","The Trial"
"38595",7849,"send K. with him. He should not be surprised if he could not understand","The Trial"
"38596",7849,"the Italian at first, he would be able to very soon, and even if he","The Trial"
"38597",7849,"really could not understand very much he said it was not so bad, as it","The Trial"
"38598",7849,"was really not so important for the Italian to be understood. And","The Trial"
"38599",7849,"anyway, K.'s knowledge of Italian was surprisingly good, the director","The Trial"
"38600",7849,"was sure he would get by very well. And with that, it was time for K. to","The Trial"
"38601",7849,"go. He spent the time still remaining to him with a dictionary, copying","The Trial"
"38602",7849,"out obscure words he would need to guide the Italian round the","The Trial"
"38603",7849,"cathedral. It was an extremely irksome task, servitors brought him the","The Trial"
"38604",7849,"mail, bank staff came with various queries and, when they saw that K.","The Trial"
"38605",7849,"was busy, stood by the door and did not go away until he had listened to","The Trial"
"38606",7849,"them, the deputy director did not miss the opportunity to disturb K. and","The Trial"
"38607",7849,"came in frequently, took the dictionary from his hand and flicked","The Trial"
"38608",7849,"through its pages, clearly for no purpose, when the door to the","The Trial"

"38637",7849,"on time. He took a taxi to the cathedral, at the last moment he had","The Trial"
"38638",7849,"remembered the album that he had had no opportunity to give to the","The Trial"
"38639",7849,"Italian earlier and so took it with him now. He held it on his knees","The Trial"
"38640",7849,"and drummed impatiently on it during the whole journey. The rain had","The Trial"
"38641",7849,"eased off slightly but it was still damp, chilly and dark, it would be","The Trial"
"38642",7849,"difficult to see anything in the cathedral but standing about on cold","The Trial"
"38643",7849,"flagstones might well make K.'s chill much worse. The square in front","The Trial"
"38644",7849,"of the cathedral was quite empty, K. remembered how even as a small","The Trial"
"38645",7849,"child he had noticed that nearly all the houses in this narrow square","The Trial"
"38646",7849,"had the curtains at their windows closed most of the time, although","The Trial"
"38647",7849,"today, with the weather like this, it was more understandable. The","The Trial"
"38648",7849,"cathedral also seemed quite empty, of course no-one would think of","The Trial"
"38649",7849,"going there on a day like this. K. hurried along both the side naves","The Trial"
"38650",7849,"but saw no-one but an old woman who, wrapped up in a warm shawl, was","The Trial"
"38651",7849,"kneeling at a picture of the Virgin Mary and staring up at it. Then, in","The Trial"
"38652",7849,"the distance, he saw a church official who limped away through a","The Trial"
"38653",7849,"doorway in the wall. K. had arrived on time, it had struck ten just as","The Trial"
"38654",7849,"he was entering the building, but the Italian still was not there. K.","The Trial"
"38655",7849,"went back to the main entrance, stood there indecisively for a while,","The Trial"
"38656",7849,"and then walked round the cathedral in the rain in case the Italian was","The Trial"
"38657",7849,"waiting at another entrance. He was nowhere to be found. Could the","The Trial"
"38658",7849,"director have misunderstood what time they had agreed on? How could","The Trial"
"38659",7849,"anyone understand someone like that properly anyway? Whatever had","The Trial"
"38660",7849,"happened, K. would have to wait for him for at least half an hour. As","The Trial"
"38661",7849,"he was tired he wanted to sit down, he went back inside the cathedral,","The Trial"
"38662",7849,"he found something like a small carpet on one of the steps, he moved it","The Trial"
"38663",7849,"with his foot to a nearby pew, wrapped himself up tighter in his coat,","The Trial"
"38664",7849,"put the collar up and sat down. To pass the time he opened the album","The Trial"
"38665",7849,"and flicked through the pages a little but soon had to give up as it","The Trial"
"38666",7849,"became so dark that when he looked up he could hardly make out anything","The Trial"
"38667",7849,"in the side nave next to him.</p>","The Trial"
"38668",7849,"","The Trial"
"38669",7849,"<p>In the distance there was a large triangle of candles flickering on the","The Trial"
"38670",7849,"main altar, K. was not certain whether he had seen them earlier.","The Trial"
"38671",7849,"Perhaps they had only just been lit. Church staff creep silently as","The Trial"
"38672",7849,"part of their job, you don't notice them. When K. happened to turn","The Trial"
"38673",7849,"round he also saw a tall, stout candle attached to a column not far","The Trial"
"38674",7849,"behind him. It was all very pretty, but totally inadequate to illuminate","The Trial"
"38675",7849,"the pictures which were usually left in the darkness of the side","The Trial"
"38676",7849,"altars, and seemed to make the darkness all the deeper. It was","The Trial"
"38677",7849,"discourteous of the Italian not to come but it was also sensible of him,","The Trial"
"38678",7849,"there would have been nothing to see, they would have had to content","The Trial"
"38679",7849,"themselves with seeking out a few pictures with K.'s electric pocket","The Trial"
"38680",7849,"torch and looking at them one small part at a time. K. went over to a","The Trial"
"38681",7849,"nearby side chapel to see what they could have hoped for, he went up a","The Trial"
"38682",7849,"few steps to a low marble railing and leant over it to look at the altar","The Trial"
"38683",7849,"picture by the light of his torch. The eternal light hung disturbingly","The Trial"
"38684",7849,"in front of it. The first thing that K. partly saw and partly guessed at","The Trial"
"38685",7849,"was a large knight in armour who was shown at the far edge of the","The Trial"
"38686",7849,"painting. He was leaning on his sword that he had stuck into the naked","The Trial"
"38687",7849,"ground in front of him where only a few blades of grass grew here and","The Trial"
"38688",7849,"there. He seemed to be paying close attention to something that was","The Trial"
"38689",7849,"being played out in front of him. It was astonishing to see how he stood","The Trial"
"38690",7849,"there without going any closer. Perhaps it was his job to stand guard.","The Trial"
"38691",7849,"It was a long time since K. had looked at any pictures and he studied","The Trial"
"38692",7849,"the knight for a long time even though he had continually to blink as","The Trial"
"38693",7849,"he found it difficult to bear the green light of his torch. Then when","The Trial"
"38694",7849,"he moved the light to the other parts of the picture he found an","The Trial"
"38695",7849,"interment of Christ shown in the usual way, it was also a comparatively","The Trial"
"38696",7849,"new painting. He put his torch away and went back to his place.</p>","The Trial"
"38697",7849,"","The Trial"
"38698",7849,"<p>There seemed to be no point in waiting for the Italian any longer, but","The Trial"
"38699",7849,"outside it was certainly raining heavily, and as it was not so cold in","The Trial"
"38700",7849,"the cathedral as K. had expected he decided to stay there for the time","The Trial"
"38701",7849,"being. Close by him was the great pulpit, there were two plain golden","The Trial"
"38702",7849,"crosses attached to its little round roof which were lying almost flat","The Trial"
"38703",7849,"and whose tips crossed over each other. The outside of the pulpit's","The Trial"
"38704",7849,"balustrade was covered in green foliage which continued down to the","The Trial"
"38705",7849,"column supporting it, little angels could be seen among the leaves,","The Trial"
"38706",7849,"some of them lively and some of them still. K. walked up to the pulpit","The Trial"
"38707",7849,"and examined it from all sides, its stonework had been sculpted with","The Trial"
"38708",7849,"great care, it seemed as if the foliage had trapped a deep darkness","The Trial"
"38709",7849,"between and behind its leaves and held it there prisoner, K. lay his","The Trial"
"38710",7849,"hand in one of these gaps and cautiously felt the stone, until then he","The Trial"
"38711",7849,"had been totally unaware of this pulpit's existence. Then K. happened","The Trial"
"38712",7849,"to notice one of the church staff standing behind the next row of pews,","The Trial"
"38713",7849,"he wore a loose, creased, black cassock, he held a snuff box in his","The Trial"
"38714",7849,"left hand and he was watching K. Now what does he want? thought K. Do I","The Trial"
"38715",7849,"seem suspicious to him? Does he want a tip? But when the man in the","The Trial"
"38716",7849,"cassock saw that K. had noticed him he raised his right hand, a pinch","The Trial"
"38717",7849,"of snuff still held between two fingers, and pointed in some vague","The Trial"
"38718",7849,"direction. It was almost impossible to understand what this behaviour","The Trial"
"38719",7849,"meant, K. waited a while longer but the man in the cassock did not stop","The Trial"
"38720",7849,"gesturing with his hand and even augmented it by nodding his head. ""Now","The Trial"
"38721",7849,"what does he want?"" asked K. quietly, he did not dare call out loud","The Trial"
"38722",7849,"here; but then he drew out his purse and pushed his way through the","The Trial"
"38723",7849,"nearest pews to reach the man. He, however, immediately gestured to","The Trial"
"38724",7849,"turn down this offer, shrugged his shoulders and limped away. As a child","The Trial"
"38725",7849,"K. had imitated riding on a horse with the same sort of movement as","The Trial"
"38726",7849,"this limp. ""This old man is like a child,"" thought K., ""he doesn't have","The Trial"
"38727",7849,"the sense for anything more than serving in a church. Look at the way","The Trial"
"38728",7849,"he stops when I stop, and how he waits to see whether I'll continue.""","The Trial"
"38729",7849,"With a smile, K. followed the old man all the way up the side nave and","The Trial"
"38730",7849,"almost as far as the main altar, all this time the old man continued to","The Trial"
"38731",7849,"point at something but K. deliberately avoided looking round, he was","The Trial"
"38732",7849,"only pointing in order to make it harder for K. to follow him.","The Trial"
"38733",7849,"Eventually, K. did stop following, he did not want to worry the old man","The Trial"
"38734",7849,"too much, and he also did not want to frighten him away completely in","The Trial"
"38735",7849,"case the Italian turned up after all.</p>","The Trial"
"38736",7849,"","The Trial"
"38737",7849,"<p>When he entered the central nave to go back to where he had left the","The Trial"
"38738",7849,"album, he noticed a small secondary pulpit on a column almost next to","The Trial"
"38739",7849,"the stalls by the altar where the choir sat. It was very simple, made","The Trial"
"38740",7849,"of plain white stone, and so small that from a distance it looked like","The Trial"
"38741",7849,"an empty niche where the statue of a saint ought to have been. It","The Trial"
"38742",7849,"certainly would have been impossible for the priest to take a full step","The Trial"
"38743",7849,"back from the balustrade, and, although there was no decoration on it,","The Trial"
"38744",7849,"the top of the pulpit curved in exceptionally low so that a man of","The Trial"
"38745",7849,"average height would not be able stand upright and would have to remain","The Trial"
"38746",7849,"bent forward over the balustrade. In all, it looked as if it had been","The Trial"
"38747",7849,"intended to make the priest suffer, it was impossible to understand why","The Trial"
"38748",7849,"this pulpit would be needed as there were also the other ones available","The Trial"
"38749",7849,"which were large and so artistically decorated.</p>","The Trial"
"38750",7849,"","The Trial"
"38751",7849,"<p>And K. would certainly not have noticed this little pulpit if there had","The Trial"
"38752",7849,"not been a lamp fastened above it, which usually meant there was a","The Trial"
"38753",7849,"sermon about to be given. So was a sermon to be given now? In this","The Trial"
"38754",7849,"empty church? K. looked down at the steps which, pressed close against","The Trial"
"38755",7849,"the column, led up to the pulpit. They were so narrow they seemed to be","The Trial"
"38756",7849,"there as decoration on the column rather than for anyone to use. But","The Trial"
"38757",7849,"under the pulpit&mdash;K. grinned in astonishment&mdash;there really was a priest","The Trial"
"38758",7849,"standing with his hand on the handrail ready to climb the steps and","The Trial"
"38759",7849,"looking at K. Then he nodded very slightly, so that K. crossed himself","The Trial"
"38760",7849,"and genuflected as he should have done earlier. With a little swing,","The Trial"
"38761",7849,"the priest went up into the pulpit with short fast steps. Was there","The Trial"
"38762",7849,"really a sermon about to begin? Maybe the man in the cassock had not","The Trial"
"38763",7849,"been really so demented, and had meant to lead K.'s way to the","The Trial"
"38764",7849,"preacher, which in this empty church would have been very necessary.","The Trial"
"38765",7849,"And there was also, somewhere in front of a picture of the Virgin Mary,","The Trial"
"38766",7849,"an old woman who should have come to hear the sermon. And if there was","The Trial"
"38767",7849,"to be a sermon why had it not been introduced on the organ? But the","The Trial"
"38768",7849,"organ remained quiet and merely looked out weakly from the darkness of","The Trial"
"38769",7849,"its great height.</p>","The Trial"
"38770",7849,"","The Trial"
"38771",7849,"<p>K. now considered whether he should leave as quickly as possible, if he","The Trial"
"38772",7849,"did not do it now there would be no chance of doing so during the","The Trial"
"38773",7849,"sermon and he would have to stay there for as long as it lasted, he had","The Trial"
"38774",7849,"lost so much time when he should have been in his office, there had","The Trial"
"38775",7849,"long been no need for him to wait for the Italian any longer, he looked","The Trial"
"38776",7849,"at his watch, it was eleven. But could there really be a sermon given?","The Trial"
"38777",7849,"Could K. constitute the entire congregation? How could he when he was","The Trial"
"38778",7849,"just a stranger who wanted to look at the church? That, basically, was","The Trial"
"38779",7849,"all he was. The idea of a sermon, now, at eleven o'clock, on a workday,","The Trial"
"38780",7849,"in hideous weather, was nonsense. The priest&mdash;there was no doubt that","The Trial"
"38781",7849,"he was a priest, a young man with a smooth, dark face&mdash;was clearly","The Trial"
"38782",7849,"going up there just to put the lamp out after somebody had lit it by","The Trial"
"38783",7849,"mistake.</p>","The Trial"
"38784",7849,"","The Trial"
"38785",7849,"<p>But there had been no mistake, the priest seemed rather to check that","The Trial"
"38786",7849,"the lamp was lit and turned it a little higher, then he slowly turned","The Trial"
"38787",7849,"to face the front and leant down on the balustrade gripping its angular","The Trial"
"38788",7849,"rail with both hands. He stood there like that for a while and, without","The Trial"
"38789",7849,"turning his head, looked around. K. had moved back a long way and leant","The Trial"
"38790",7849,"his elbows on the front pew. Somewhere in the church&mdash;he could not have","The Trial"
"38791",7849,"said exactly where&mdash;he could make out the man in the cassock hunched","The Trial"
"38792",7849,"under his bent back and at peace, as if his work were completed. In the","The Trial"
"38793",7849,"cathedral it was now very quiet! But K. would have to disturb that","The Trial"
"38794",7849,"silence, he had no intention of staying there; if it was the priest's","The Trial"
"38795",7849,"duty to preach at a certain time regardless of the circumstances then","The Trial"
"38796",7849,"he could, and he could do it without K.'s taking part, and K.'s","The Trial"
"38797",7849,"presence would do nothing to augment the effect of it. So K. began","The Trial"
"38798",7849,"slowly to move, felt his way on tiptoe along the pew, arrived at the","The Trial"
"38799",7849,"broad aisle and went along it without being disturbed, except for the","The Trial"
"38800",7849,"sound of his steps, however light, which rang out on the stone floor","The Trial"
"38801",7849,"and resounded from the vaulting, quiet but continuous at a repeating,","The Trial"
"38802",7849,"regular pace. K. felt slightly abandoned as, probably observed by the","The Trial"
"38803",7849,"priest, he walked by himself between the empty pews, and the size of","The Trial"
"38804",7849,"the cathedral seemed to be just at the limit of what a man could bear.","The Trial"
"38805",7849,"When he arrived back at where he had been sitting he did not hesitate","The Trial"
"38806",7849,"but simply reached out for the album he had left there and took it with","The Trial"
"38807",7849,"him. He had nearly left the area covered by pews and was close to the","The Trial"
"38808",7849,"empty space between himself and the exit when, for the first time, he","The Trial"
"38809",7849,"heard the voice of the priest. A powerful and experienced voice. It","The Trial"
"38810",7849,"pierced through the reaches of the cathedral ready waiting for it! But","The Trial"
"38811",7849,"the priest was not calling out to the congregation, his cry was quite","The Trial"
"38812",7849,"unambiguous and there was no escape from it, he called ""Josef K.!""</p>","The Trial"
"38813",7849,"","The Trial"
"38814",7849,"<p>K. stood still and looked down at the floor. In theory he was still","The Trial"
"38815",7849,"free, he could have carried on walking, through one of three dark","The Trial"
"38816",7849,"little wooden doors not far in front of him and away from there. It","The Trial"
"38817",7849,"would simply mean he had not understood, or that he had understood but","The Trial"
"38818",7849,"chose not to pay attention to it. But if he once turned round he would","The Trial"
"38819",7849,"be trapped, then he would have acknowledged that he had understood","The Trial"
"38820",7849,"perfectly well, that he really was the Josef K. the priest had called","The Trial"
"38821",7849,"to and that he was willing to follow. If the priest had called out","The Trial"
"38822",7849,"again K. would certainly have carried on out the door, but everything","The Trial"
"38823",7849,"was silent as K. also waited, he turned his head slightly as he wanted","The Trial"
"38824",7849,"to see what the priest was doing now. He was merely standing in the","The Trial"
"38825",7849,"pulpit as before, but it was obvious that he had seen K. turn his head.","The Trial"
"38826",7849,"If K. did not now turn round completely it would have been like a child","The Trial"
"38827",7849,"playing hide and seek. He did so, and the priest beckoned him with his","The Trial"
"38828",7849,"finger. As everything could now be done openly he ran&mdash;because of","The Trial"
"38829",7849,"curiosity and the wish to get it over with&mdash;with long flying leaps","The Trial"
"38830",7849,"towards the pulpit. At the front pews he stopped, but to the priest he","The Trial"
"38831",7849,"still seemed too far away, he reached out his hand and pointed sharply","The Trial"
"38832",7849,"down with his finger to a place immediately in front of the pulpit. And","The Trial"
"38833",7849,"K. did as he was told, standing in that place he had to bend his head a","The Trial"
"38834",7849,"long way back just to see the priest. ""You are Josef K.,"" said the","The Trial"
"38835",7849,"priest, and raised his hand from the balustrade to make a gesture whose","The Trial"
"38836",7849,"meaning was unclear. ""Yes,"" said K., he considered how freely he had","The Trial"
"38837",7849,"always given his name in the past, for some time now it had been a","The Trial"
"38838",7849,"burden to him, now there were people who knew his name whom he had","The Trial"
"38839",7849,"never seen before, it had been so nice first to introduce yourself and","The Trial"
"38840",7849,"only then for people to know who you were. ""You have been accused,""","The Trial"
"38841",7849,"said the priest, especially gently. ""Yes,"" said K., ""so I have been","The Trial"
"38842",7849,"informed."" ""Then you are the one I am looking for,"" said the priest. ""I","The Trial"
"38843",7849,"am the prison chaplain."" ""I see,"" said K. ""I had you summoned here,""","The Trial"
"38844",7849,"said the priest, ""because I wanted to speak to you."" ""I knew nothing of","The Trial"
"38845",7849,"that,"" said K. ""I came here to show the cathedral to a gentleman from","The Trial"
"38846",7849,"Italy."" ""That is beside the point,"" said the priest. ""What are you","The Trial"
"38847",7849,"holding in your hand? Is it a prayer book?"" ""No,"" answered K., ""it's an","The Trial"
"38848",7849,"album of the city's tourist sights."" ""Put it down,"" said the priest. K.","The Trial"
"38849",7849,"threw it away with such force that it flapped open and rolled across","The Trial"
"38850",7849,"the floor, tearing its pages. ""Do you know your case is going badly?""","The Trial"
"38851",7849,"asked the priest. ""That's how it seems to me too,"" said K. ""I've","The Trial"
"38852",7849,"expended a lot of effort on it, but so far with no result. Although I do","The Trial"
"38853",7849,"still have some documents to submit."" ""How do you imagine it will end?""","The Trial"
"38854",7849,"asked the priest. ""At first I thought it was bound to end well,"" said","The Trial"
"38855",7849,"K., ""but now I have my doubts about it. I don't know how it will end. Do","The Trial"
"38856",7849,"you know?"" ""I don't,"" said the priest, ""but I fear it will end badly.","The Trial"
"38857",7849,"You are considered guilty. Your case will probably not even go beyond a","The Trial"

"38859",7849,"""But I'm not guilty,"" said K., ""there's been a mistake. How is it even","The Trial"
"38860",7849,"possible for someone to be guilty? We're all human beings here, one","The Trial"
"38861",7849,"like the other."" ""That is true,"" said the priest, ""but that is how the","The Trial"
"38862",7849,"guilty speak."" ""Do you presume I'm guilty too?"" asked K. ""I make no","The Trial"
"38863",7849,"presumptions about you,"" said the priest. ""I thank you for that,"" said","The Trial"
"38864",7849,"K. ""but everyone else involved in these proceedings has something","The Trial"
"38865",7849,"against me and presumes I'm guilty. They even influence those who","The Trial"
"38866",7849,"aren't involved. My position gets harder all the time."" ""You don't","The Trial"
"38867",7849,"understand the facts,"" said the priest, ""the verdict does not come","The Trial"

"38869",7849,"""I see,"" said K., lowering his head. ""What do you intend to do about","The Trial"
"38870",7849,"your case next?"" asked the priest. ""I still need to find help,"" said","The Trial"
"38871",7849,"K., raising his head to see what the priest thought of this. ""There are","The Trial"
"38872",7849,"still certain possibilities I haven't yet made use of."" ""You look for","The Trial"
"38873",7849,"too much help from people you don't know,"" said the priest","The Trial"
"38874",7849,"disapprovingly, ""and especially from women. Can you really not see","The Trial"
"38875",7849,"that's not the help you need?"" ""Sometimes, in fact quite often, I could","The Trial"
"38876",7849,"believe you're right,"" said K., ""but not always. Women have a lot of","The Trial"
"38877",7849,"power. If I could persuade some of the women I know to work together","The Trial"

"38880",7849,"examining judge a woman in the distance and he'll run right over the","The Trial"
"38881",7849,"desk, and the accused, just to get to her as soon as he can."" The","The Trial"
"38882",7849,"priest lowered his head down to the balustrade, only now did the roof","The Trial"
"38883",7849,"over the pulpit seem to press him down. What sort of dreadful weather","The Trial"
"38884",7849,"could it be outside? It was no longer just a dull day, it was deepest","The Trial"
"38885",7849,"night. None of the stained glass in the main window shed even a flicker","The Trial"
"38886",7849,"of light on the darkness of the walls. And this was the moment when the","The Trial"
"38887",7849,"man in the cassock chose to put out the candles on the main altar, one","The Trial"
"38888",7849,"by one. ""Are you cross with me?"" asked K. ""Maybe you don't know what","The Trial"
"38889",7849,"sort of court it is you serve."" He received no answer. ""Well, it's just","The Trial"
"38890",7849,"my own experience,"" said K. Above him there was still silence. ""I didn't","The Trial"
"38891",7849,"mean to insult you,"" said K. At that, the priest screamed down at K.:","The Trial"
"38892",7849,"""Can you not see two steps in front of you?"" He shouted in anger, but it","The Trial"
"38893",7849,"was also the scream of one who sees another fall and, shocked and","The Trial"
"38894",7849,"without thinking, screams against his own will.</p>","The Trial"
"38895",7849,"","The Trial"
"38896",7849,"<p>The two men, then, remained silent for a long time. In the darkness","The Trial"
"38897",7849,"beneath him, the priest could not possibly have seen K. distinctly,","The Trial"
"38898",7849,"although K. was able to see him clearly by the light of the little","The Trial"
"38899",7849,"lamp. Why did the priest not come down? He had not given a sermon, he","The Trial"
"38900",7849,"had only told K. a few things which, if he followed them closely, would","The Trial"
"38901",7849,"probably cause him more harm than good. But the priest certainly seemed","The Trial"
"38902",7849,"to mean well, it might even be possible, if he would come down and","The Trial"
"38903",7849,"co-operate with him, it might even be possible for him to obtain some","The Trial"
"38904",7849,"acceptable piece of advice that could make all the difference, it","The Trial"
"38905",7849,"might, for instance, be able to show him not so much to influence the","The Trial"
"38906",7849,"proceedings but how to break free of them, how to evade them, how to","The Trial"
"38907",7849,"live away from them. K. had to admit that this was something he had had","The Trial"
"38908",7849,"on his mind quite a lot of late. If the priest knew of such a","The Trial"
"38909",7849,"possibility he might, if K. asked him, let him know about it, even","The Trial"
"38910",7849,"though he was part of the court himself and even though, when K. had","The Trial"
"38911",7849,"criticised the court, he had held down his gentle nature and actually","The Trial"
"38912",7849,"shouted at K.</p>","The Trial"
"38913",7849,"","The Trial"
"38914",7849,"<p>""Would you not like to come down here?"" asked K. ""If you're not going","The Trial"
"38915",7849,"to give a sermon come down here with me."" ""Now I can come down,"" said","The Trial"
"38916",7849,"the priest, perhaps he regretted having shouted at K. As he took down","The Trial"
"38917",7849,"the lamp from its hook he said, ""to start off with I had to speak to","The Trial"

"38920",7849,"","The Trial"
"38921",7849,"<p>K. waited for him at the foot of the steps. While he was still on one","The Trial"
"38922",7849,"of the higher steps as he came down them the priest reached out his","The Trial"
"38923",7849,"hand for K. to shake. ""Can you spare me a little of your time?"" asked","The Trial"
"38924",7849,"K. ""As much time as you need,"" said the priest, and passed him the","The Trial"
"38925",7849,"little lamp for him to carry. Even at close distance the priest did not","The Trial"
"38926",7849,"lose a certain solemnity that seemed to be part of his character. ""You","The Trial"
"38927",7849,"are very friendly towards me,"" said K., as they walked up and down","The Trial"
"38928",7849,"beside each other in the darkness of one of the side naves. ""That makes","The Trial"
"38929",7849,"you an exception among all those who belong to the court. I can trust","The Trial"
"38930",7849,"you more than any of the others I've seen. I can speak openly with you.""","The Trial"
"38931",7849,"""Don't fool yourself,"" said the priest. ""How would I be fooling myself?""","The Trial"
"38932",7849,"asked K. ""You fool yourself in the court,"" said the priest, ""it talks","The Trial"
"38933",7849,"about this self-deceit in the opening paragraphs to the law. In front of","The Trial"
"38934",7849,"the law there is a doorkeeper. A man from the countryside comes up to","The Trial"
"38935",7849,"the door and asks for entry. But the doorkeeper says he can't let him in","The Trial"
"38936",7849,"to the law right now. The man thinks about this, and then he asks if","The Trial"
"38937",7849,"he'll be able to go in later on. 'That's possible,' says the doorkeeper,","The Trial"
"38938",7849,"'but not now.' The gateway to the law is open as it always is, and the","The Trial"
"38939",7849,"doorkeeper has stepped to one side, so the man bends over to try and","The Trial"
"38940",7849,"see in. When the doorkeeper notices this he laughs and says, 'If you're","The Trial"
"38941",7849,"tempted give it a try, try and go in even though I say you can't.","The Trial"
"38942",7849,"Careful though: I'm powerful. And I'm only the lowliest of all the","The Trial"
"38943",7849,"doormen. But there's a doorkeeper for each of the rooms and each of","The Trial"
"38944",7849,"them is more powerful than the last. It's more than I can stand just to","The Trial"
"38945",7849,"look at the third one.' The man from the country had not expected","The Trial"
"38946",7849,"difficulties like this, the law was supposed to be accessible for","The Trial"
"38947",7849,"anyone at any time, he thinks, but now he looks more closely at the","The Trial"
"38948",7849,"doorkeeper in his fur coat, sees his big hooked nose, his long thin","The Trial"
"38949",7849,"tartar-beard, and he decides it's better to wait until he has","The Trial"
"38950",7849,"permission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit","The Trial"
"38951",7849,"down to one side of the gate. He sits there for days and years. He tries","The Trial"
"38952",7849,"to be allowed in time and again and tires the doorkeeper with his","The Trial"
"38953",7849,"requests. The doorkeeper often questions him, asking about where he's","The Trial"
"38954",7849,"from and many other things, but these are disinterested questions such","The Trial"
"38955",7849,"as great men ask, and he always ends up by telling him he still can't","The Trial"
"38956",7849,"let him in. The man had come well equipped for his journey, and uses","The Trial"
"38957",7849,"everything, however valuable, to bribe the doorkeeper. He accepts","The Trial"
"38958",7849,"everything, but as he does so he says, 'I'll only accept this so that","The Trial"
"38959",7849,"you don't think there's anything you've failed to do.' Over many years,","The Trial"
"38960",7849,"the man watches the doorkeeper almost without a break. He forgets about","The Trial"
"38961",7849,"the other doormen, and begins to think this one is the only thing","The Trial"
"38962",7849,"stopping him from gaining access to the law. Over the first few years he","The Trial"
"38963",7849,"curses his unhappy condition out loud, but later, as he becomes old, he","The Trial"
"38964",7849,"just grumbles to himself. He becomes senile, and as he has come to know","The Trial"
"38965",7849,"even the fleas in the doorkeeper's fur collar over the years that he has","The Trial"
"38966",7849,"been studying him he even asks them to help him and change the","The Trial"
"38967",7849,"doorkeeper's mind. Finally his eyes grow dim, and he no longer knows","The Trial"
"38968",7849,"whether it's really getting darker or just his eyes that are deceiving","The Trial"
"38969",7849,"him. But he seems now to see an inextinguishable light begin to shine","The Trial"
"38970",7849,"from the darkness behind the door. He doesn't have long to live now.","The Trial"
"38971",7849,"Just before he dies, he brings together all his experience from all this","The Trial"
"38972",7849,"time into one question which he has still never put to the doorkeeper.","The Trial"
"38973",7849,"He beckons to him, as he's no longer able to raise his stiff body. The","The Trial"
"38974",7849,"doorkeeper has to bend over deeply as the difference in their sizes has","The Trial"
"38975",7849,"changed very much to the disadvantage of the man. 'What is it you want","The Trial"
"38976",7849,"to know now?' asks the doorkeeper, 'You're insatiable.' 'Everyone wants","The Trial"
"38977",7849,"access to the law,' says the man, 'how come, over all these years,","The Trial"
"38978",7849,"no-one but me has asked to be let in?' The doorkeeper can see the man's","The Trial"
"38979",7849,"come to his end, his hearing has faded, and so, so that he can be heard,","The Trial"
"38980",7849,"he shouts to him: 'Nobody else could have got in this way, as this","The Trial"
"38981",7849,"entrance was meant only for you. Now I'll go and close it.'""</p>","The Trial"
"38982",7849,"","The Trial"
"38983",7849,"<p>""So the doorkeeper cheated the man,"" said K. immediately, who had been","The Trial"
"38984",7849,"captivated by the story. ""Don't be too quick,"" said the priest, ""don't","The Trial"
"38985",7849,"take somebody else's opinion without checking it. I told you the story","The Trial"
"38986",7849,"exactly as it was written. There's nothing in there about cheating.""","The Trial"
"38987",7849,"""But it's quite clear,"" said K., ""and your first interpretation of it","The Trial"
"38988",7849,"was quite correct. The doorkeeper gave him the information that would","The Trial"
"38989",7849,"release him only when it could be of no more use."" ""He didn't ask him","The Trial"
"38990",7849,"before that,"" said the priest, ""and don't forget he was only a","The Trial"
"38991",7849,"doorkeeper, and as doorkeeper he did his duty."" ""What makes you think","The Trial"
"38992",7849,"he did his duty?"" asked K., ""He didn't. It might have been his duty to","The Trial"
"38993",7849,"keep everyone else away, but this man is who the door was intended for","The Trial"
"38994",7849,"and he ought to have let him in."" ""You're not paying enough attention","The Trial"
"38995",7849,"to what was written and you're changing the story,"" said the priest.","The Trial"
"38996",7849,"""According to the story, there are two important things that the","The Trial"
"38997",7849,"doorkeeper explains about access to the law, one at the beginning, one","The Trial"
"38998",7849,"at the end. At one place he says he can't allow him in now, and at the","The Trial"
"38999",7849,"other he says this entrance was intended for him alone. If one of the","The Trial"
"39000",7849,"statements contradicted the other you would be right and the doorkeeper","The Trial"
"39001",7849,"would have cheated the man from the country. But there is no","The Trial"
"39002",7849,"contradiction. On the contrary, the first statement even hints at the","The Trial"
"39003",7849,"second. You could almost say the doorkeeper went beyond his duty in","The Trial"
"39004",7849,"that he offered the man some prospect of being admitted in the future.","The Trial"
"39005",7849,"Throughout the story, his duty seems to have been merely to turn the","The Trial"
"39006",7849,"man away, and there are many commentators who are surprised that the","The Trial"
"39007",7849,"doorkeeper offered this hint at all, as he seems to love exactitude and","The Trial"
"39008",7849,"keeps strict guard over his position. He stays at his post for many","The Trial"
"39009",7849,"years and doesn't close the gate until the very end, he's very","The Trial"
"39010",7849,"conscious of the importance of his service, as he says, 'I'm powerful,'","The Trial"
"39011",7849,"he has respect for his superiors, as he says, 'I'm only the lowliest of","The Trial"
"39012",7849,"the doormen,' he's not talkative, as through all these years the only","The Trial"
"39013",7849,"questions he asks are 'disinterested,' he's not corruptible, as when","The Trial"
"39014",7849,"he's offered a gift he says, 'I'll only accept this so that you don't","The Trial"
"39015",7849,"think there's anything you've failed to do,' as far as fulfilling his","The Trial"
"39016",7849,"duty goes he can be neither ruffled nor begged, as it says about the","The Trial"
"39017",7849,"man that, 'he tires the doorkeeper with his requests,' even his","The Trial"
"39018",7849,"external appearance suggests a pedantic character, the big hooked nose","The Trial"
"39019",7849,"and the long, thin, black tartar-beard. How could any doorkeeper be","The Trial"
"39020",7849,"more faithful to his duty? But in the doorkeeper's character there are","The Trial"
"39021",7849,"also other features which might be very useful for those who seek entry","The Trial"
"39022",7849,"to the law, and when he hinted at some possibility in the future it","The Trial"
"39023",7849,"always seemed to make it clear that he might even go beyond his duty.","The Trial"
"39024",7849,"There's no denying he's a little simple-minded, and that makes him a","The Trial"
"39025",7849,"little conceited. Even if all he said about his power and the power of","The Trial"
"39026",7849,"the other doorkeepers and how not even he could bear the sight of","The Trial"
"39027",7849,"them&mdash;I say even if all these assertions are right, the way he makes","The Trial"
"39028",7849,"them shows that he's too simple and arrogant to understand properly.","The Trial"
"39029",7849,"The commentators say about this that, 'correct understanding of a matter","The Trial"
"39030",7849,"and a misunderstanding of the same matter are not mutually exclusive.'","The Trial"
"39031",7849,"Whether they're right or not, you have to concede that his simplicity","The Trial"
"39032",7849,"and arrogance, however little they show, do weaken his function of","The Trial"
"39033",7849,"guarding the entrance, they are defects in the doorkeeper's character.","The Trial"
"39034",7849,"You also have to consider that the doorkeeper seems to be friendly by","The Trial"
"39035",7849,"nature, he isn't always just an official. He makes a joke right at the","The Trial"
"39036",7849,"beginning, in that he invites the man to enter at the same time as","The Trial"
"39037",7849,"maintaining the ban on his entering, and then he doesn't send him away","The Trial"
"39038",7849,"but gives him, as it says in the text, a stool to sit on and lets him","The Trial"
"39039",7849,"stay by the side of the door. The patience with which he puts up with","The Trial"
"39040",7849,"the man's requests through all these years, the little questioning","The Trial"
"39041",7849,"sessions, accepting the gifts, his politeness when he puts up with the","The Trial"
"39042",7849,"man cursing his fate even though it was the doorkeeper who caused that","The Trial"
"39043",7849,"fate&mdash;all these things seem to want to arouse our sympathy. Not every","The Trial"
"39044",7849,"doorkeeper would have behaved in the same way. And finally, he lets the","The Trial"
"39045",7849,"man beckon him and he bends deep down to him so that he can put his","The Trial"
"39046",7849,"last question. There's no more than some slight impatience&mdash;the","The Trial"
"39047",7849,"doorkeeper knows everything's come to its end&mdash;shown in the words,","The Trial"
"39048",7849,"'You're insatiable.' There are many commentators who go even further in","The Trial"
"39049",7849,"explaining it in this way and think the words, 'you're insatiable' are","The Trial"
"39050",7849,"an expression of friendly admiration, albeit with some condescension.","The Trial"
"39051",7849,"However you look at it the figure of the doorkeeper comes out","The Trial"

"39056",7849,"different opinions about it. You shouldn't pay too much attention to","The Trial"
"39057",7849,"people's opinions. The text cannot be altered, and the various opinions","The Trial"
"39058",7849,"are often no more than an expression of despair over it. There's even","The Trial"
"39059",7849,"one opinion which says it's the doorkeeper who's been cheated."" ""That","The Trial"
"39060",7849,"does seem to take things too far,"" said K. ""How can they argue the","The Trial"
"39061",7849,"doorkeeper has been cheated?"" ""Their argument,"" answered the priest,","The Trial"
"39062",7849,"""is based on the simplicity of the doorkeeper. They say the doorkeeper","The Trial"
"39063",7849,"doesn't know the inside of the law, only the way into it where he just","The Trial"
"39064",7849,"walks up and down. They see his ideas of what's inside the law as","The Trial"
"39065",7849,"rather childish, and suppose he's afraid himself of what he wants to","The Trial"
"39066",7849,"make the man frightened of. Yes, he's more afraid of it than the man, as","The Trial"
"39067",7849,"the man wants nothing but to go inside the law, even after he's heard","The Trial"
"39068",7849,"about the terrible doormen there, in contrast to the doorkeeper who","The Trial"
"39069",7849,"doesn't want to go in, or at least we don't hear anything about it. On","The Trial"
"39070",7849,"the other hand, there are those who say he must have already been inside","The Trial"
"39071",7849,"the law as he has been taken on into its service and that could only","The Trial"
"39072",7849,"have been done inside. That can be countered by supposing he could have","The Trial"
"39073",7849,"been given the job of doorkeeper by somebody calling out from inside,","The Trial"
"39074",7849,"and that he can't have gone very far inside as he couldn't bear the","The Trial"
"39075",7849,"sight of the third doorkeeper. Nor, through all those years, does the","The Trial"
"39076",7849,"story say the doorkeeper told the man anything about the inside, other","The Trial"
"39077",7849,"than his comment about the other doorkeepers. He could have been","The Trial"
"39078",7849,"forbidden to do so, but he hasn't said anything about that either. All","The Trial"
"39079",7849,"this seems to show he doesn't know anything about what the inside looks","The Trial"
"39080",7849,"like or what it means, and that that's why he's being deceived. But he's","The Trial"
"39081",7849,"also being deceived by the man from the country as he's this man's","The Trial"
"39082",7849,"subordinate and doesn't know it. There's a lot to indicate that he","The Trial"
"39083",7849,"treats the man as his subordinate, I expect you remember, but those who","The Trial"
"39084",7849,"hold this view would say it's very clear that he really is his","The Trial"
"39085",7849,"subordinate. Above all, the free man is superior to the man who has to","The Trial"
"39086",7849,"serve another. Now, the man really is free, he can go wherever he wants,","The Trial"
"39087",7849,"the only thing forbidden to him is entry into the law and, what's more,","The Trial"
"39088",7849,"there's only one man forbidding him to do so&mdash;the doorkeeper. If he","The Trial"
"39089",7849,"takes the stool and sits down beside the door and stays there all his","The Trial"
"39090",7849,"life he does this of his own free will, there's nothing in the story to","The Trial"
"39091",7849,"say he was forced to do it. On the other hand, the doorkeeper is kept to","The Trial"
"39092",7849,"his post by his employment, he's not allowed to go away from it and it","The Trial"
"39093",7849,"seems he's not allowed to go inside either, not even if he wanted to.","The Trial"
"39094",7849,"Also, although he's in the service of the law he's only there for this","The Trial"
"39095",7849,"one entrance, therefore he's there only in the service of this one man","The Trial"
"39096",7849,"who the door's intended for. This is another way in which he's his","The Trial"
"39097",7849,"subordinate. We can take it that he's been performing this somewhat","The Trial"
"39098",7849,"empty service for many years, through the whole of a man's life, as it","The Trial"
"39099",7849,"says that a man will come, that means someone old enough to be a man.","The Trial"
"39100",7849,"That means the doorkeeper will have to wait a long time before his","The Trial"
"39101",7849,"function is fulfilled, he will have to wait for as long as the man","The Trial"
"39102",7849,"liked, who came to the door of his own free will. Even the end of the","The Trial"
"39103",7849,"doorkeeper's service is determined by when the man's life ends, so the","The Trial"
"39104",7849,"doorkeeper remains his subordinate right to the end. And it's pointed","The Trial"
"39105",7849,"out repeatedly that the doorkeeper seems to know nothing of any of","The Trial"
"39106",7849,"this, although this is not seen as anything remarkable, as those who","The Trial"
"39107",7849,"hold this view see the doorkeeper as deluded in a way that's far worse,","The Trial"
"39108",7849,"a way that's to do with his service. At the end, speaking about the","The Trial"
"39109",7849,"entrance he says, 'Now I'll go and close it,' although at the beginning","The Trial"
"39110",7849,"of the story it says the door to the law is open as it always is, but if","The Trial"
"39111",7849,"it's always open&mdash;always&mdash;that means it's open independently of the","The Trial"
"39112",7849,"lifespan of the man it's intended for, and not even the doorkeeper will","The Trial"
"39113",7849,"be able to close it. There are various opinions about this, some say","The Trial"
"39114",7849,"the doorkeeper was only answering a question or showing his devotion to","The Trial"
"39115",7849,"duty or, just when the man was in his last moments, the doorkeeper","The Trial"
"39116",7849,"wanted to cause him regret and sorrow. There are many who agree that he","The Trial"
"39117",7849,"wouldn't be able to close the door. They even believe, at the end at","The Trial"
"39118",7849,"least, the doorkeeper is aware, deep down, that he's the man's","The Trial"
"39119",7849,"subordinate, as the man sees the light that shines out of the entry to","The Trial"
"39120",7849,"the law whereas the doorkeeper would probably have his back to it and","The Trial"
"39121",7849,"says nothing at all to show there's been any change."" ""That is well","The Trial"
"39122",7849,"substantiated,"" said K., who had been repeating some parts of the","The Trial"
"39123",7849,"priest's explanation to himself in a whisper. ""It is well substantiated,","The Trial"
"39124",7849,"and now I too think the doorkeeper must have been deceived. Although","The Trial"
"39125",7849,"that does not mean I've abandoned what I thought earlier as the two","The Trial"
"39126",7849,"versions are, to some extent, not incompatible. It's not clear whether","The Trial"
"39127",7849,"the doorkeeper sees clearly or is deceived. I said the man had been","The Trial"
"39128",7849,"cheated. If the doorkeeper understands clearly, then there could be some","The Trial"
"39129",7849,"doubt about it, but if the doorkeeper has been deceived then the man is","The Trial"
"39130",7849,"bound to believe the same thing. That would mean the doorkeeper is not a","The Trial"
"39131",7849,"cheat but so simple-minded that he ought to be dismissed from his job","The Trial"
"39132",7849,"immediately; if the doorkeeper is mistaken it will do him no harm but","The Trial"
"39133",7849,"the man will be harmed immensely."" ""There you've found another opinion,""","The Trial"
"39134",7849,"said the priest, ""as there are many who say the story doesn't give","The Trial"
"39135",7849,"anyone the right to judge the doorkeeper. However he might seem to us he","The Trial"
"39136",7849,"is still in the service of the law, so he belongs to the law, so he's","The Trial"
"39137",7849,"beyond what man has a right to judge. In this case we can't believe the","The Trial"
"39138",7849,"doorkeeper is the man's subordinate. Even if he has to stay at the","The Trial"
"39139",7849,"entrance into the law his service makes him incomparably more than if he","The Trial"
"39140",7849,"lived freely in the world. The man has come to the law for the first","The Trial"
"39141",7849,"time and the doorkeeper is already there. He's been given his position","The Trial"
"39142",7849,"by the law, to doubt his worth would be to doubt the law."" ""I can't say","The Trial"
"39143",7849,"I'm in complete agreement with this view,"" said K. shaking his head, ""as","The Trial"
"39144",7849,"if you accept it you'll have to accept that everything said by the","The Trial"
"39145",7849,"doorkeeper is true. But you've already explained very fully that that's","The Trial"
"39146",7849,"not possible."" ""No,"" said the priest, ""you don't need to accept","The Trial"
"39147",7849,"everything as true, you only have to accept it as necessary.""","The Trial"
"39148",7849,"""Depressing view,"" said K. ""The lie made into the rule of the world.""</p>","The Trial"

"39150",7849,"<p>K. said that as if it were his final word but it was not his","The Trial"
"39151",7849,"conclusion. He was too tired to think about all the ramifications of","The Trial"
"39152",7849,"the story, and the sort of thoughts they led him into were not familiar","The Trial"
"39153",7849,"to him, unrealistic things, things better suited for officials of the","The Trial"
"39154",7849,"court to discuss than for him. The simple story had lost its shape, he","The Trial"
"39155",7849,"wanted to shake it off, and the priest who now felt quite compassionate","The Trial"
"39156",7849,"allowed this and accepted K.'s remarks without comment, even though his","The Trial"

"39159",7849,"<p>In silence, they carried on walking for some time, K. stayed close","The Trial"
"39160",7849,"beside the priest without knowing where he was. The lamp in his hand","The Trial"
"39161",7849,"had long since gone out. Once, just in front of him, he thought he","The Trial"
"39162",7849,"could see the statue of a saint by the glitter of the silver on it,","The Trial"
"39163",7849,"although it quickly disappeared back into the darkness. So that he would","The Trial"
"39164",7849,"not remain entirely dependent on the priest, K. asked him, ""We're now","The Trial"
"39165",7849,"near the main entrance, are we?"" ""No,"" said the priest, ""we're a long","The Trial"
"39166",7849,"way from it. Do you already want to go?"" K. had not thought of going","The Trial"
"39167",7849,"until then, but he immediately said, ""Yes, certainly, I have to go. I'm","The Trial"
"39168",7849,"the chief clerk in a bank and there are people waiting for me, I only","The Trial"
"39169",7849,"came here to show a foreign business contact round the cathedral.""","The Trial"
"39170",7849,"""Alright,"" said the priest offering him his hand, ""go then."" ""But I","The Trial"
"39171",7849,"can't find my way round in this darkness by myself,"" said K. ""Go to your","The Trial"
"39172",7849,"left as far as the wall,"" said the priest, ""then continue alongside the","The Trial"
"39173",7849,"wall without leaving it and you'll find a way out."" The priest had only","The Trial"
"39174",7849,"gone a few paces from him, but K. was already shouting loudly, ""Please,","The Trial"
"39175",7849,"wait!"" ""I'm waiting,"" said the priest. ""Is there anything else you want","The Trial"
"39176",7849,"from me?"" asked K. ""No,"" said the priest. ""You were so friendly to me","The Trial"
"39177",7849,"earlier on,"" said K., ""and you explained everything, but now you","The Trial"
"39178",7849,"abandon me as if I were nothing to you."" ""You have to go,"" said the","The Trial"

"39209",7849,"gentlemen nodded, one of them indicated the other with the top hand now","The Trial"
"39210",7849,"in his hand. K. told them he had been expecting a different visitor. He","The Trial"

"39212",7849,"of the windows on the other side of the street were also dark already,","The Trial"
"39213",7849,"many of them had the curtains closed. In one of the windows on the same","The Trial"

"39242",7849,"possible. ""Maybe they're tenors,"" he thought as he saw their big double","The Trial"

"39247",7849,"<p>When K. noticed that, he stopped, which meant the others had to stop","The Trial"
"39248",7849,"too; they were at the edge of an open square, devoid of people but","The Trial"
"39249",7849,"decorated with flower beds. ""Why did they send you, of all people!"" he","The Trial"
"39250",7849,"cried out, more a shout than a question. The two gentleman clearly knew","The Trial"
"39251",7849,"no answer to give, they waited, their free arms hanging down, like","The Trial"
"39252",7849,"nurses when the patient needs to rest. ""I will go no further,"" said K.","The Trial"
"39253",7849,"as if to see what would happen. The gentlemen did not need to make any","The Trial"
"39254",7849,"answer, it was enough that they did not loosen their grip on K. and","The Trial"
"39255",7849,"tried to move him on, but K. resisted them. ""I'll soon have no need of","The Trial"

"39259",7849,"","The Trial"
"39260",7849,"<p>Just then, Miss Bürstner came up into the square in front of them from","The Trial"
"39261",7849,"the steps leading from a small street at a lower level. It was not","The Trial"
"39262",7849,"certain that it was her, although the similarity was, of course, great.","The Trial"
"39263",7849,"But it did not matter to K. whether it was certainly her anyway, he","The Trial"
"39264",7849,"just became suddenly aware that there was no point in his resistance.","The Trial"
"39265",7849,"There would be nothing heroic about it if he resisted, if he now caused","The Trial"
"39266",7849,"trouble for these gentlemen, if in defending himself he sought to enjoy","The Trial"
"39267",7849,"his last glimmer of life. He started walking, which pleased the","The Trial"
"39268",7849,"gentlemen and some of their pleasure conveyed itself to him. Now they","The Trial"
"39269",7849,"permitted him to decide which direction they took, and he decided to","The Trial"
"39270",7849,"take the direction that followed the young woman in front of them, not","The Trial"
"39271",7849,"so much because he wanted to catch up with her, nor even because he","The Trial"
"39272",7849,"wanted to keep her in sight for as long as possible, but only so that","The Trial"
"39273",7849,"he would not forget the reproach she represented for him. ""The only","The Trial"
"39274",7849,"thing I can do now,"" he said to himself, and his thought was confirmed","The Trial"
"39275",7849,"by the equal length of his own steps with the steps of the two others,","The Trial"
"39276",7849,"""the only thing I can do now is keep my common sense and do what's","The Trial"
"39277",7849,"needed right till the end. I always wanted to go at the world and try","The Trial"

"39287",7849,"<p>Meanwhile, the young woman had turned off into a side street, but K.","The Trial"
"39288",7849,"could do without her now and let his companions lead him. All three of","The Trial"
"39289",7849,"them now, in complete agreement, went over a bridge in the light of the","The Trial"
"39290",7849,"moon, the two gentlemen were willing to yield to each little movement","The Trial"
"39291",7849,"made by K. as he moved slightly towards the edge and directed the group","The Trial"
"39292",7849,"in that direction as a single unit. The moonlight glittered and","The Trial"
"39293",7849,"quivered in the water, which divided itself around a small island","The Trial"
"39294",7849,"covered in a densely-piled mass of foliage and trees and bushes.","The Trial"
"39295",7849,"Beneath them, now invisible, there were gravel paths with comfortable","The Trial"
"39296",7849,"benches where K. had stretched himself out on many summer's days. ""I","The Trial"
"39297",7849,"didn't actually want to stop here,"" he said to his companions, shamed by","The Trial"
"39298",7849,"their compliance with his wishes. Behind K.'s back one of them seemed","The Trial"
"39299",7849,"to quietly criticise the other for the misunderstanding about stopping,","The Trial"
"39300",7849,"and then they went on. They went on up through several streets where","The Trial"
"39301",7849,"policemen were walking or standing here and there; some in the distance","The Trial"
"39302",7849,"and then some very close. One of them with a bushy moustache, his hand","The Trial"
"39303",7849,"on the grip of his sword, seemed to have some purpose in approaching","The Trial"
"39304",7849,"the group, which was hardly unsuspicious. The two gentlemen stopped,","The Trial"
"39305",7849,"the policeman seemed about to open his mouth, and then K. drove his","The Trial"
"39306",7849,"group forcefully forward. Several times he looked back cautiously to see","The Trial"
"39307",7849,"if the policeman was following; but when they had a corner between","The Trial"
"39308",7849,"themselves and the policeman K. began to run, and the two gentlemen,","The Trial"
"39309",7849,"despite being seriously short of breath, had to run with him.</p>","The Trial"
"39310",7849,"","The Trial"
"39311",7849,"<p>In this way they quickly left the built up area and found themselves in","The Trial"
"39312",7849,"the fields which, in this part of town, began almost without any","The Trial"
"39313",7849,"transition zone. There was a quarry, empty and abandoned, near a","The Trial"
"39314",7849,"building which was still like those in the city. Here the men stopped,","The Trial"
"39315",7849,"perhaps because this had always been their destination or perhaps","The Trial"
"39316",7849,"because they were too exhausted to run any further. Here they released","The Trial"
"39317",7849,"their hold on K., who just waited in silence, and took their top hats","The Trial"
"39318",7849,"off while they looked round the quarry and wiped the sweat off their","The Trial"
"39319",7849,"brows with their handkerchiefs. The moonlight lay everywhere with the","The Trial"

"39321",7849,"","The Trial"
"39322",7849,"<p>After exchanging a few courtesies about who was to carry out the next","The Trial"
"39323",7849,"tasks&mdash;the gentlemen did not seem to have been allocated specific","The Trial"
"39324",7849,"functions&mdash;one of them went to K. and took his coat, his waistcoat, and","The Trial"
"39325",7849,"finally his shirt off him. K. made an involuntary shiver, at which the","The Trial"
"39326",7849,"gentleman gave him a gentle, reassuring tap on the back. Then he","The Trial"
"39327",7849,"carefully folded the things up as if they would still be needed, even","The Trial"
"39328",7849,"if not in the near future. He did not want to expose K. to the chilly","The Trial"
"39329",7849,"night air without moving though, so he took him under the arm and","The Trial"
"39330",7849,"walked up and down with him a little way while the other gentleman","The Trial"
"39331",7849,"looked round the quarry for a suitable place. When he had found it he","The Trial"
"39332",7849,"made a sign and the other gentleman escorted him there. It was near the","The Trial"
"39333",7849,"rockface, there was a stone lying there that had broken loose. The","The Trial"
"39334",7849,"gentlemen sat K. down on the ground, leant him against the stone and","The Trial"
"39335",7849,"settled his head down on the top of it. Despite all the effort they","The Trial"
"39336",7849,"went to, and despite all the co-operation shown by K., his demeanour","The Trial"
"39337",7849,"seemed very forced and hard to believe. So one of the gentlemen asked","The Trial"
"39338",7849,"the other to grant him a short time while he put K. in position by","The Trial"
"39339",7849,"himself, but even that did nothing to make it better. In the end they","The Trial"
"39340",7849,"left K. in a position that was far from the best of the ones they had","The Trial"
"39341",7849,"tried so far. Then one of the gentlemen opened his frock coat and from a","The Trial"
"39342",7849,"sheath hanging on a belt stretched across his waistcoat he withdrew a","The Trial"
"39343",7849,"long, thin, double-edged butcher's knife which he held up in the light","The Trial"
"39344",7849,"to test its sharpness. The repulsive courtesies began once again, one of","The Trial"
"39345",7849,"them passed the knife over K. to the other, who then passed it back over","The Trial"
"39346",7849,"K. to the first. K. now knew it would be his duty to take the knife as","The Trial"
"39347",7849,"it passed from hand to hand above him and thrust it into himself. But","The Trial"
"39348",7849,"he did not do it, instead he twisted his neck, which was still free,","The Trial"
"39349",7849,"and looked around. He was not able to show his full worth, was not able","The Trial"
"39350",7849,"to take all the work from the official bodies, he lacked the rest of","The Trial"
"39351",7849,"the strength he needed and this final shortcoming was the fault of","The Trial"
"39352",7849,"whoever had denied it to him. As he looked round, he saw the top floor","The Trial"
"39353",7849,"of the building next to the quarry. He saw how a light flickered on and","The Trial"
"39354",7849,"the two halves of a window opened out, somebody, made weak and thin by","The Trial"
"39355",7849,"the height and the distance, leant suddenly far out from it and","The Trial"
"39356",7849,"stretched his arms out even further. Who was that? A friend? A good","The Trial"
"39357",7849,"person? Somebody who was taking part? Somebody who wanted to help? Was","The Trial"
"39358",7849,"he alone? Was it everyone? Would anyone help? Were there objections that","The Trial"
"39359",7849,"had been forgotten? There must have been some. The logic cannot be","The Trial"
"39360",7849,"refuted, but someone who wants to live will not resist it. Where was the","The Trial"
