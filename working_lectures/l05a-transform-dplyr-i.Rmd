# Pipes

---

## Where does the name come from?
We have already seen the `%>%` operator a bit.  The pipe operator is implemented in the package **magrittr**.
<!-- <sup>1</sup> -->
.pull-left[
![Magritte's representation of a pipe (that's not a pipe!)](l05/img/magritte.jpg)
]
.pull-right[
![magrittr](l05/img/magrittr.jpg)
]
<!-- .footnote[[1] In R 4.1, there is also support for a variant of the pipe with `|>`. It behaves similarly, but not identically to magrittr's `%>%`.  For the moment, personally, I am holding off using it in this course or in my own projects to avoid a hard dependency on R 4.1.] -->
<!-- ??? -->
<font size="3">
"The Treachery of Images" is a 1929 painting by Belgian surrealist painter Ren√© Magritte. 
<!-- It is also known as This Is Not a Pipe[2]. It is on display at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.[1] -->
The painting shows an image of a pipe. Below it, Magritte painted, "Ceci n'est pas une pipe", French for "This is not a pipe".
</font>
> The famous pipe. How people reproached me for it! And yet, could you stuff my pipe? No, it's just a representation, is it not? So if I had written on my picture "This is a pipe", I'd have been lying!
---

## How does a pipe work?

- You can think about the following sequence of actions - find your helmet, 
 ride your bike to school, then lock it somewhere.
- Expressed as a set of nested functions in R pseudocode this would look like:
```{r eval=FALSE}
lock(ride(find(who=tanzy, what = "helmet"), to = "campus"))
```
we have to read this from the "inside-out".

---
## How does a pipe work?

- The pipe gives it a more natural (and easier to read) 
**postfix** syntax<sup>1</sup>, where we can read from left to right:
```{r eval=FALSE}
tanzy %>% find(what = "helmet") %>%
  ride(to = "campus") %>%
  lock()
```
.footnote[[1] Note similar syntax in java(script), C++ and python where the method accessor "`.`" can be chained in some cases: `tanzy.find('helmet').ride('campus').lock()`]

---

## What about other arguments?

The pipe, by default sends its left-hand value to first positional argument of the right-hand function.  To send results to a function argument other than first one or to use the previous result for multiple arguments, use `.`:

```{r fig.height=1.8, fig.width = 3.75}
starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
  lm(mass ~ height, data = .)
```

<!-- --- -->

<!-- ## The pipe vs ggplot2 layers -->

<!-- - The `+` operator in **ggplot2**<sup>1</sup> is used for "layering." This means you create the plot in layers, separated by `+`. -->

<!-- - Some of the reason for this distinction is historical rather than mechanistic -->

<!-- .footnote[[1] to make matters even more confusing, ggplot2 also has the `%+%` operator.  This modifies the `data` being used in the plot.] -->

## NYC Flights

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
```

This data frame contains all `r format(nrow(nycflights13::flights), big.mark = ",")` flights that departed from New York City in 2013. The data comes from the US [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=120&Link=0), and is documented in `?flights`.

## A Grammar of Data Manipulation

**dplyr** is based on the concepts of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames.

Single data frame functions / verbs:

<!-- <font size = "3"> -->

* `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
* `slice`: pick rows using index(es)
* `select`: pick columns by name
* `pull`: grab a column as a vector
* `rename`: rename specific columns
* `arrange`: reorder rows
* `mutate`: add new variables
* `transmute`: create new data frame with variables
* `distinct`: filter for unique rows
* `sample_n` / `sample_frac`: randomly sample rows
* `summarise`: reduce variables to values
* `group_by`: run an operation by levels of a categorical variable
* ... (many more)

<!-- </font> -->

---

## **dplyr** rules for functions

1. First argument is *always* a `data.frame`<sup>1</sup>
2. Subsequent arguments say what to do with that `data.frame`
3. Always return a new `data.frame` 
4. Doesn't modify in place

.footnote[[1] Or `tibble`, the tidyverse version of a `data.frame`.  These are mostly interchangable, but with a few differences we'll consider in a couple weeks.]
---

## Filter rows with `filter`

- Select a subset of rows in a data frame based on when a logical expression returns `TRUE`
- Easily filter for many conditions at once by combining logical expressions

*remember* we used filter in lab 1
```
dino_data = datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")
```

---
class: code70
## `filter`

- Let's extract all flights from new york that occurred in April.
```{r}
flights %>% filter(month == 4)
```

---
class: code70
## `filter` with multple conditions

- You can filter based on more than two variables using logical operators.
- All flights that were both in April and from JFK:
```{r}
flights %>% filter(month == 4 & origin == "JFK")
```

---
class: code70
## `filter` with multple conditions

- `filter()` will also perform the **and** operation if you separate logical conditions by a comma.
```{r}
flights %>% filter(month == 4, origin == "JFK")
```
---

## Aside: enumerating a categorical variable

- If you didn't know what origins were possible in the `flights` data, then you can take one of two approaches:
    1. `unique()`
    2. `table(x, exclude = NULL)` to get the counts of each level.  The `exclude = NULL` indicates that `NA` missing values should also be listed -- you almost certainly want this!
    
```{r}
unique(flights$origin)
table(flights$origin, exclude = NULL)
```

---

## Boolean expressions

- This code finds all flights that departed in November or December:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)
```
The order of operations doesn't work like English. You can't write `filter(flights, month == (11 | 12))`, to mean "find all flights that departed in November or December."
- Instead, this would find all months that equal `11 | 12`, an expression that evaluates to `TRUE`.
- In a numeric context (like here), `TRUE` is coerced to `1`, so this finds all flights in January, not November or December. This *is* quite confusing!

---
class: code70, font120
## Missing Values

- `filter()` .alert[excludes] observations with .alert[missing values.]
```{r}
dfdat = tibble(x = c(1, 2, NA),
                    y = c('A', 'B', 'C'))
dfdat
dfdat %>% filter(x == 1)
```
- If you want to extract those rows as well, you have to ask for them
  explicitly using `is.na()`:
```{r}
dfdat %>% filter(x == 1 | is.na(x))
```

---
class: code70
## Missing Values are contagious

```{r}
NA > 5; 10 == NA; NA + 10
```

- Therefore, **you cannot test for missingness with `== NA`**:
```{r}
x = NA
x == NA
is.na(x)
```

operator    | definition                   || operator     | definition
------------ | ------------------------------ || -------------- | ----------------
`<`         | less than                    ||`x`&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;`y`     | `x` OR `y` 
`<=`        |	less than or equal to        ||`is.na(x)`    | test if `x` is `NA`
`>`         | greater than                 ||`!is.na(x)`   | test if `x` is not `NA`

## Check your understanding 

1. .question[Extract the January LGA flights and the December JFK flights.]
4. .question[Extract flights whose `dep_time` was `NA`.]
2. .question[Extract flights that left in November or December.]
3. .question[Extract flights that left in November or December using the `%in%` operator.]

---

## Answers

```
flights %>% filter((month == 1 & origin == "LGA") | (month == 12 & origin == "JFK"))
```

```
flights %>% filter(is.na(dep_time))
```

```
flights %>% filter(month == 11 | month == 12)
```

```
nov_dec = filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
```

---
## Create New Variables

- The variables given are usually not enough for an analysis.
- For instance:
  + log-transform positive values to make associations more linear.
  + recode categorical variables to add / remove levels
  + clean up messy text data
  + ... or any other mathematical or CS .alert[vector function] of the data.
  
---
class: code70
## `mutate` to add new variables

- We can use `mutate()` to create new variables from old.

```{r}
temp=flights %>% mutate(gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
                 speed = distance / air_time * 60,
                 .before = year) #add before `year` variable
colnames(temp)
temp[,c("gain","speed")]
```

---

## Converting to minutes since midnight

- **Exercise**: (RDS 5.2.1) `dep_time` is convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because it's not a continuous value:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(flights, aes(x = dep_time)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)
```

---
## Check your understanding

- Convert `dep_time` into `dep_minutes_midnight`, the number of minutes since midnight. Hint: `%/%` is truncating integer division and `%%` is  remainder.  For instance:
  
```{r}
101 / 10
101 %/% 10
101 %% 10
```

---
## Answer

```{r}
flights %>% mutate(dep_h = dep_time %/% 100,
            dep_m = dep_time %% 100,
            dep_elapsed_min = dep_h * 60 + dep_m,
            .after=dep_time)
```

---
## Only preserving new variables

If you only want to keep new variables, use `transmute()`

```{r}
flights %>%
      transmute(gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
                hours = air_time / 60,
                gain_per_hour = gain / hours)
```

You'll use this much less often than `mutate` but when you need it, you need it.

---
## Useful mutation functions

-  Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`
-  Arithmetic operators in conjunction with scalar functions: 
  +  `x_center = x - mean(x)`
  +  `x_proportion = x / sum(x)`
  +  `x_01 = (x-min(x))/(max(x) - min(x))`
- Modular arithmetic: `%/%` (integer division) and `%%` (remainder)
- Logs: `log()`, `log2()`, `log10()`
- offsets: `lead()` and `lag()`
- Cumulative and rolling aggregates: `cumsum()`, `cumprod()`, `cummin()`, `cummax()`, `cummean()`.
- Ranking: `min_rank()`.  Mind how `NA` and ties are handled!
- Recoding: `case_when()`, `ifelse()`

---

## Recoding with `case_when` and `ifelse`

-  `case_when` lets us generate a new variable with multiple values that depend on arbitrary boolean expressions.  
-  Each boolean expression is evaluated in turn, and the first matching value is used.  
-  The syntax is 
```r
case_when(<BOOLEAN EXPRESSION 1> ~ "value1",
          <BOOLEAN EXPRESSION 2> ~ "value2",
          <more expressions and values>,
          TRUE ~ "Optional fallthrough value")
```
-  If the `TRUE ~ "Optional fallthrough"` isn't provided and no cases match, than the value will be `NA`.
-  `ifelse` is a simplified version:
```r
ifelse(<BOOLEAN EXPRESSION>, 'True value', 'False value')
```
---
class: code70

Suppose we wanted to see how often "time is made up in the air."  We might say this is true when the `dep_delay > 0 & arr_delay < dep_delay`, but there are 3 other possibilities: 
2.  Ontime when we left, and ontime when we arrived
3.  Ontime when we left, but arrived delayed
4.  We were delayed when we left, and even more delayed when we arrived.

```{r}
flights = flights %>% 
  mutate(delay_type = 
           case_when(dep_delay > 0 & arr_delay < dep_delay ~ 'made up time',
                    dep_delay > 0 & arr_delay >= dep_delay ~ 'lost time',
                    dep_delay <= 0 & arr_delay > 0 ~ 'headwind?', #<<
                    dep_delay <= 0 & arr_delay <= 0 ~ 'life is good'))#<<
table(flights$delay_type, exclude= NULL)
```

---
class: code70

Because of the sequential evaluation of the cases, the following is equivalent (note highlighted lines).

```{r}
flights = flights %>% 
  mutate(delay_type = 
           case_when(dep_delay > 0 & arr_delay < dep_delay ~ 'made up time',
                    dep_delay > 0 & arr_delay >= dep_delay ~ 'lost time',
                    arr_delay > 0 ~ 'headwind?', #<<
                    arr_delay <= 0 ~ 'life is good')) #<<
table(flights$delay_type, exclude= NULL)
```


---

## `select` to keep only the variables you mention
.scroll-box-14[
```{r}
flights %>%
  select(carrier, origin) %>%
  table()
```
]

---

## or `select` to exclude variables

```{r}
flights %>%
  select(-year)
```

---

## or `select` a range of variables

```{r}
flights %>%
  select(carrier:dest)
```

---
class: code70

## `rename` specific columns


Useful for correcting typos, and renaming to make variable names shorter 
and/or more informative

- Rename `day` to `day_of_month`:
```{r}
flights_rn =  flights %>%
  rename(day_of_month = day)
```

- Can also rename while selecting with `select(var1, var2, new_name = var3)`.

---

## Check before you move on

When in doubt, check your changes and confirm code did what you wanted it to do

.small[
```{r}
names(flights_rn)
```
]

## `summarize` reduces vectors to scalars

---
class: code70

## `summarise`  reduces vectors to scalars

So far, all the operations we have done have been `data.frame` in, and `data.frame` with the same number of rows out.

Summarize calculates scalar summaries from a vector.

```{r}
flights %>%
  summarize(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            median_delay = median(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
---
class: code70

## What's with the `na.rm=TRUE`?

- When we set to `na.rm = FALSE` (which is the default!):
```{r}
flights %>%
  summarize(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = FALSE),
            median_delay = median(dep_delay, na.rm = FALSE))
```

---
class: code70

## What's with the `na.rm=TRUE`?

- Although you will frequently want to set `na.rm = TRUE` in statistical functions, it defaults `FALSE` for a reason -- so you will know there are and examine why there are missing values.

```{r}
filter(flights, is.na(dep_delay))
```

These are flights that were cancelled!  So in the same way, the `dep_delay` is infinite.

---

## Useful summary functions

*  central tendency: `mean()`, `median()`, `mode()`.
*  dispersion: `sd()`, `IQR()`, `mad(x)`.
*  support: `min()`, `max()`.
*  index:  `first()`, `nth(x, 2)`, `last()`<sup>1</sup>
*  counts: `n()`, `sum()`, `sum(!is.na(x))` (count non-missing), `n_distinct()` (count distinct)
.footnote[[1] These probably only make sense in `group_by` summaries.  They could make could sense in an ungrouped mutates, though!]

*  Most of these are going to taste better with `na.rm = TRUE`
*  All can be used with `mutate`--their return value will be "recycled" to the same number of rows as the input data.frame.

## Row-altering operations with `slice`

---


## `slice` to extract by row index

First five
```{r}
flights %>% 
  slice_head(n = 5)
```

---

## `slice` to extract by row index

Last 3
```{r}
flights %>%
  slice_tail(n = 3)
```

---

## Subsample rows with `sample_n` or `sample_frac`

- `sample_n`: randomly sample 5 observations

```{r}
flights_n5 = flights %>%
  sample_n(5, replace = FALSE)
dim(flights_n5)
```

- `sample_frac`: randomly sample 20% of observations

```{r}
flights_perc20 = flights %>%
  sample_frac(0.2, replace = FALSE)
dim(flights_perc20)
```

---

## `arrange` to sort a `data.frame` on its values

What flights departed earliest before their scheduled time?
```{r}
flights %>% arrange(dep_delay) %>% relocate(dep_delay)
```

---

## Descending arrange

What were the most delayed flights? 
```{r}
flights %>% arrange(desc(arr_delay)) %>%
  relocate(arr_delay)
```
---

## Arranging with ties

```{r}
flights %>% select(sched_dep_time, origin, dest, day, carrier, flight) %>%
  arrange(origin, dest,sched_dep_time, day)
```
This might reveal when flight numbers are reused or changed for the same route and timing.

---

## `distinct` to filter for unique rows

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(origin, dest) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(origin, dest)
```

---
class: code70

## `pull` to extract a column as a vector

```{r}
flights %>% slice_head(n = 5) %>% pull(dest)
```

Compare to 
```{r}
flights %>% slice_head(n = 5) %>% select(dest)
```

.question[What is similar and what is different in the return value between these two?]

## The two `pull`s in your lives

.pull-left[
![pipe](l05/img/hex-dplyr.png)
]
.pull-right[
![magrittr](l05/img/Octocat.png)
]

- Don't get `pull` happy when wrangling data! It's rarely needed while you are using tidyverse functions.
- But always `r emo::ji("arrow_down")` `Pull` before starting your work when collaborating on GitHub.

# grouped operations

---

## group_by()

We'll discuss this in much greater detail next week.  But to whet your appetite, how might we calculate the carrier with the worst on-time percentage?

```{r}
ontime = flights %>% mutate(ontime = arr_delay <= 0)  
ontime %>% summarize(ontime_pct = mean(ontime, na.rm = TRUE)*100)
```
This calculates over all carriers. 

---

## grouped summaries

To do it by carrier, we just add

```{r}
ontime %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% #<<
  summarize(ontime_pct = mean(ontime, na.rm = TRUE)*100) %>%
  arrange(ontime_pct)
```
